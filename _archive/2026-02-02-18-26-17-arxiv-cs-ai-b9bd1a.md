## Summary

arXiv:2601.22369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Provably correct distributed protocols, which are a critical component of modern distributed systems, are highly challenging to design and have often required decades of human effort. These protocols allow multiple agents to coordinate to come to a common agreement in an environment with uncertainty and failures. We formulate protocol design as a search problem over strategies in a game with imperfect information, and the desired correctness condi
