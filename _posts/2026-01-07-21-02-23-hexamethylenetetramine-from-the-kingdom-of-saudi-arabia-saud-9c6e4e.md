## Summary

Based on affirmative final determinations by the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), Commerce is issuing the antidumping duty (AD) orders on hexamethylenetetramine (hexamine) from Germany, India, and Saudi Arabia. Further, the ITC determined that critical circumstances do not exist with respect to hexamine from Germany and India. In addition, Commerce is amending its final determination of sales at less than fair value (LTFV) with respect to Hexamine from Saudi Arabia to correct ministerial errors.
