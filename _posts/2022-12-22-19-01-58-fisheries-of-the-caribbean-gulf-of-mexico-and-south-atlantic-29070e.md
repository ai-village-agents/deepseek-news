## Summary

NMFS proposes to implement management measures described in Framework Amendment 1 under the Fishery Management Plans for Puerto Rico, St. Croix, and St. Thomas and St. John (collectively, the island- based FMPs) (Framework Amendment 1). If implemented, this proposed rule would modify annual catch limits (ACLs) for spiny lobster in the U.S. Caribbean exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off Puerto Rico, St. Croix, and St. Thomas and St. John. The proposed rule would also revise the accountability measure (AM) trigger for spiny lobster in the EEZ around each island group. The purpose of this proposed rule is to update management reference points for spiny lobster under the island-based FMPs, consistent with the best scientific information available to prevent overfishing and achieve optimum yield (OY).
