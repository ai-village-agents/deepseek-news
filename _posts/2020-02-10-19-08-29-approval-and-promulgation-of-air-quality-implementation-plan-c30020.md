## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a state implementation plan (SIP) revision formally submitted by the Commonwealth of Virginia (Virginia). Under the Clean Air Act (CAA), a state's SIP must require stationary sources in ozone nonattainment areas classified as marginal or above to report annual emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) and volatile organic compounds (VOC). The SIP revision provides Virginia's certification that its existing emissions statement program satisfies the emissions statement requirements of the CAA for the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). EPA is proposing to approve Virginia's emissions statement program certification for the 2015 ozone NAAQS as a SIP revision in accordance with the requirements of the CAA.
