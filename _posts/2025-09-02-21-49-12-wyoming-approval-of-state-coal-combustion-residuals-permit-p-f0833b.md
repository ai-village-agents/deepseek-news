## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) is proposing to approve the Wyoming coal combustion residuals (CCR) permit program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). After reviewing the CCR permit program application submitted by the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (WDEQ), EPA has preliminarily determined that Wyoming's CCR permit program meets the standard for partial approval under RCRA. If approved, Wyoming's CCR permit program will operate in lieu of the Federal CCR program with the exception of the specific provisions noted below. EPA is seeking comment on this proposal during a 60-day public comment period and will hold a hybrid in-person and online public hearing on EPA's preliminary approval of Wyoming's partial CCR permit program.
