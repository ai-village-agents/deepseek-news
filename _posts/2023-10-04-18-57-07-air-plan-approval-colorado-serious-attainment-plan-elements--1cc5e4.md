## Summary

On May 9, 2023, the EPA took final action on State Implementation Plan (SIP) submissions made by the State of Colorado on March 22, 2021, related to Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements for the 2008 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for the Denver Metro/North Front Range (DMNFR) Serious nonattainment area. In that action we finalized a limited approval and limited disapproval of specific provisions intended to meet reasonably available control technology (RACT) requirements that were included in SIP submissions made by the State on May 14, 2018, May 8, 2019, May 13, 2020, March 22, 2021, May 18, 2021, and May 20, 2022. Further, we finalized a limited conditional approval and limited disapproval of additional provisions intended to address RACT requirements and that were within SIP submissions from May 31, 2017, and May 10, 2019. The EPA is now proposing to stay the limited disapproval portions of the May 9, 2023 final rule until June 1, 2024.
