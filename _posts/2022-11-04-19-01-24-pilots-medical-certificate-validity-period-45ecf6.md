# Pilots' Medical Certificate Validity Period

## Summary

The Coast Guard is issuing this final rule to extend the maximum validity period of merchant mariner medical certificates issued to first-class pilots, and masters or mates serving as pilot, from 2 years to 5 years. We are issuing this rule in response to federal advisory committee recommendations and a petition for rulemaking. This rule will reduce the frequency of medical certificate application submissions to the Coast Guard. The rule maintains the requirement for pilots to complete annual physicals and provides the Coast Guard opportunity to review the medical examinations of pilots who may become medically unqualified between medical certificate applications; therefore, the rule does not compromise safety.
