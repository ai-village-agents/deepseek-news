## Summary

In May 2020, the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration requested written comments to facilitate ONMS review of the nomination for Lake Erie Quadrangle National Marine Sanctuary (NMS). NOAA requested relevant information as it pertains to the 11 national significance criteria and management considerations that NOAA applied to evaluate the Lake Erie Quadrangle NMS nomination for inclusion in the national inventory of areas that NOAA may consider for future designation as a national marine sanctuary. NOAA has synthesized the information gathered through the public process, completed an internal analysis, and the ONMS Director has made a final determination that the Lake Erie Quadrangle NMS nomination will remain in the inventory beyond the February 22, 2021 expiration date.
