## Summary

The Coast Guard is changing the name and operating schedule that governs the Central Oregon and Pacific railroad bridge across the Umpqua River, mile 11.5, at Reedsport, OR. This rule changes the name of the Central Oregon and Pacific railroad bridge; allows that bridge to be maintained in the closed to navigation position, removes the requirement for fog signals for that bridge and changes the name of the US 101 Bridge that crosses the side channel of the Umpqua River.
