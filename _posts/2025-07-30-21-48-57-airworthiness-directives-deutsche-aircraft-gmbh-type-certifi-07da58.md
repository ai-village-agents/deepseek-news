## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2024-03- 07, which applied to all Deutsche Aircraft GmbH Model 328-100 and 328- 300 airplanes. AD 2024-03-07 required a one-time detailed inspection of each affected part, and applicable corrective actions. Since the FAA issued AD 2024-03-07, the FAA determined that repetitive inspections are necessary. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2024-03- 07 and requires repetitive inspections of the affected part. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
