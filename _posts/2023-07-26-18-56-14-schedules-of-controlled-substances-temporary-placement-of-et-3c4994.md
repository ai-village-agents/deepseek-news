## Summary

The Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration is issuing this temporary order to schedule five synthetic benzodiazepine substances: etizolam, flualprazolam, clonazolam, flubromazolam, and diclazepam, in schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. This action is based on a finding by the Administrator that the placement of these five substances in schedule I is necessary to avoid imminent hazard to the public safety. As a result of this order, the regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions applicable to schedule I controlled substances will be imposed on persons who handle (manufacture, distribute, reverse distribute, import, export, engage in research, conduct instructional activities or chemical analysis with, or possess) or propose to handle these five specified controlled substances.
