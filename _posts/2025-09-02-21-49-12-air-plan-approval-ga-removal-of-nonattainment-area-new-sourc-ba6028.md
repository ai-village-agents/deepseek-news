## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Georgia through the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) on June 27, 2024. The revision seeks to remove permitting requirements related to nonattainment, including nonattainment new source review (NNSR), from Georgia's SIP as obsolete, remove certain provisions related to the use of emission reduction credits (ERCs), and make other changes based upon the lack of any areas designated as nonattainment for the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) in Georgia. EPA is proposing to approve these changes pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act).
