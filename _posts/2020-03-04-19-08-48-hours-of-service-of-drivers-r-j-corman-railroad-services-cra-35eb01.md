## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to grant the application of R.J. Corman Railroad Services, Cranemasters, Inc., (collectively, "the Companies") and the National Railroad Construction and Maintenance Association, Inc. (NRC) for an exemption from the prohibition against driving a property-carrying commercial motor vehicle (CMV) after the 14th hour after coming on duty and driving after accumulating 60 hours of on-duty time in 7 consecutive days (60-hour rule), or 70 hours of on-duty time in 8 consecutive days (70-hour rule). The exemption will enable railroad employees subject to the hours-of-service (HOS) rules to respond to unplanned events that occur outside of or extend beyond the employee's normal work hours. FMCSA concluded that granting the Companies/NRC's application is likely to achieve a level of safety equivalent to or greater than the level of safety that would be obtained in the absence of the exemption.
