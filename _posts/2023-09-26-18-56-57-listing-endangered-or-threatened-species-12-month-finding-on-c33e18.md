## Summary

We, NMFS, announce a 12-month determination on a petition to revise the critical habitat designation for the North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Based on our review of the best available information on North Pacific right whale habitat use, we intend to revise the critical habitat. This finding describes how we intend to proceed, particularly regarding analysis and review of the relevant data and information that have become available since North Pacific right whale critical habitat was designated in 2008.
