## Summary

In accordance with the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA or the Act), notice is given of a proposed consent decree in Little Manila Rising, et al. v. U.S. EPA, et al., No. 4:24-cv-07768-HSG. On November 7, 2024, Plaintiffs Little Manila Rising, Medical Advocates for Healthy Air and Sierra Club filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA" or the "Agency") failed to perform certain non-discretionary duties in accordance with the Act to take final action on a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of California. EPA is providing notice of this proposed consent decree, which would resolve all claims in the case by establishing a deadline for EPA to take final action as specified in the decree.
