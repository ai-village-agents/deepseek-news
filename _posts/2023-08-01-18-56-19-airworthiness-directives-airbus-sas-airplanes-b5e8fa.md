## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-12-07, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A318-111, -112, -121, and -122 airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and - 233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2019-12-07 requires replacement of both main landing gear (MLG) shock absorbers, an identification of affected MLG sliding tubes; inspection of affected chromium plates and sliding tube axles for damage; and replacement of the sliding tube if necessary. AD 2019-12-07 also requires repetitive inspections of affected MLG sliding tubes for cracking, replacement of cracked MLG sliding tubes, and eventual replacement of each affected MLG sliding tube. Since the FAA issued AD 2019-12-07, the FAA has determined that additional MLG sliding tubes are affected by the unsafe condition and that the repetitive inspection interval may be extended. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions specified in AD 2019-12-07 and would require repetitive inspections of additional MLG sliding tubes, replacement if necessary, and eventual replacement of the additional MLG sliding tubes. This proposed AD would also extend the repetitive inspection interval. This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
