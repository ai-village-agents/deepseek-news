## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is seeking public comment to inform its reconsideration of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) risk management rule for carbon tetrachloride (CTC). As promulgated in December 2024, the CTC risk management action addressed the unreasonable risk of injury to health presented by CTC under its conditions of use by requiring various workplace exposure controls for most conditions of use, prohibiting certain industrial and commercial uses, and establishing other requirements. This request for public comment follows the filing of several legal challenges to the rule in 2025, and EPA's determination that the CTC risk management rule under TSCA should be reconsidered through further rulemaking. EPA intends to consider information received in response to this public comment solicitation, and other reasonably available information, to inform the development of any proposed rule to amend the CTC regulation as appropriate.
