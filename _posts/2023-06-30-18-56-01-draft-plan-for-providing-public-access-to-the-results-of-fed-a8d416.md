## Summary

The National Institute of Standards and Technology seeks comments on the Draft NIST Plan for Providing Public Access to the Results of Federally Funded Research. NIST is taking steps to make its scientific data and publications more readily available and accessible by the public, as directed in an August 2022 memorandum from the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The NIST Public Access Plan applies to the results of research funded wholly or in part by NIST, presented in peer-reviewed scholarly publications and as research data. This document outlines NIST's plan for implementing new requirements to manage the public access of scientific data and publications. Public comments received on the NIST Public Access Plan will inform NIST as it revises its existing directives to implement the updated Plan.
