## Summary

This action amends Class E airspace at Rifle Garfield County Airport, Rifle, CO. The action increases the circular radius of the Class E airspace, designated as a surface area, to the west and northwest of the airport. Also, this action amends the Class E airspace by adding an airspace area, designated as an extension to a Class D or Class E surface area, to the east of the airport. Additionally, this action amends the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface by increasing the radius of the airspace around most of the airport and reducing the radius to the north and northeast of the airport. This action also removes the extensions from this airspace area. Lastly, this action makes several administrative corrections to the airspace legal descriptions for the airport.
