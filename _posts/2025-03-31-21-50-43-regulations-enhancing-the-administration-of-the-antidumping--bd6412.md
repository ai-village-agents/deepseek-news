## Summary

On December 16, 2024, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) issued a final rule amending its antidumping and countervailing duty regulations. However, certain regulatory language in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) was inadvertently deleted, an incorrect punctuation mark was used, and a letter was left off a word. This correction restores the deleted language to the relevant regulation and corrects the typographical errors.
