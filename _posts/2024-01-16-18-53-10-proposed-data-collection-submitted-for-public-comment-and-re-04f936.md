## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Airline and Traveler Information Collection: Domestic Manifests and Passenger Locator Form. These data collection forms align with CDC's regulatory and public health mission under the authorities listed in CDC regulations to allow CDC to collect passenger and crew information from travelers and airlines when there has been a confirmed or suspected case of communicable disease aboard a domestic or international flight that puts other travelers at public health risk.
