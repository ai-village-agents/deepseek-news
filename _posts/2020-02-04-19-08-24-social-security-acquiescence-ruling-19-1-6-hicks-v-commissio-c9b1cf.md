## Summary

This Social Security AR explains how we will apply a holding in a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. We have determined that the court's holding conflicts with our interpretation of the provisions of the Social Security Act (Act) that require us to disregard evidence when we conduct a redetermination or make an initial determination of entitlement or eligibility, in cases in which there is a reason to believe that fraud or similar fault was involved in the providing of evidence.
