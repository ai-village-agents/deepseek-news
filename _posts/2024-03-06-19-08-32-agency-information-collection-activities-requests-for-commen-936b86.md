## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on June 23, 2023 under docket number FAA-2020-0385. The collection involves information on the availability of airport gates and related facilities, leasing and sub-leasing arrangements, gate-use requirements, gate-assignment policy, financial constraints, airport controls over air- and ground-side capacity, and whether the airport intends to build or acquire gates that would be used as common facilities. The information to be collected is necessary because it is required by statute that a covered airport submits a written competition plan to the Secretary/Administrator in order to receive approval to impose a Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) or to receive a grant under the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) or Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL).
