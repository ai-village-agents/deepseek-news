## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to grant exemptions for 32 member companies of the American Pyrotechnics Association (APA) from certain hours of service (HOS) regulations during designated Independence Day periods. The exemptions will allow drivers for these companies to exclude off-duty and sleeper berth time of any length from the calculation of the 14-hour limit and to use paper records of duty status (RODS) in lieu of electronic logging devices (ELDs). FMCSA has analyzed the application for exemptions and the public comments submitted and has determined that the exemptions, subject to the terms and conditions imposed, will likely achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to or greater than the level of safety that would be achieved through compliance with the regulations.
