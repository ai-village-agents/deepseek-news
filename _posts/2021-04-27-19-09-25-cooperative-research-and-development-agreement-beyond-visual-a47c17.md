## Summary

The Coast Guard announces its intent to enter into one or more cooperative research and development agreements (CRADA) with companies to evaluate a detect and avoid (DAA) system to determine its potential use in a maritime environment to enable the Coast Guard to safely fly sUAS beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS). The Coast Guard will conduct flight testing and evaluations of sUAS under a wide variety of simulated but realistic and relevant real-world maritime operational scenarios, such as: Law enforcement; search and rescue; and maritime environmental responses. The Coast Guard is currently considering separate partnerships with Scientific Applications & Research Associates (SARA) Inc., Iris Automation Inc., and Echodyne Corp. and solicits public comment on the possible participation of other parties in the proposed CRADAs, and the nature of that participation. The Coast Guard also invites other potential non-Federal participants, who have the interest and capability to bring similar contributions to this type of research, to consider submitting proposals for consideration in similar CRADAs.
