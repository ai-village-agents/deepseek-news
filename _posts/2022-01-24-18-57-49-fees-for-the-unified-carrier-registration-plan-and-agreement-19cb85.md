## Summary

FMCSA is proposing reductions in the annual registration fees States collect from motor carriers, motor private carriers of property, brokers, freight forwarders, and leasing companies for the Unified Carrier Registration (UCR) Plan and Agreement for the 2023 year and subsequent registration years. The proposed fees for the 2023 registration year would be reduced below the fees for 2022 by approximately 27 percent. The reduction in annual registration fees would be between $16 and $15,350 per entity, depending on the number of vehicles owned or operated by the affected entities.
