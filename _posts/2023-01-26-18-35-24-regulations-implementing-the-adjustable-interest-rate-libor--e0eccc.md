## Summary

The Board is adopting a final rule (final rule) to implement the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act. The final rule establishes benchmark replacements for contracts governed by U.S. law that reference certain tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR (the overnight and one-, three-, six-, and 12-month tenors) and that do not have terms that provide for the use of a clearly defined and practicable replacement benchmark rate following the first London banking day after June 30, 2023. The final rule also provides additional definitions and clarifications consistent with the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act.
