## Summary

On November 8, 2022, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking to establish a temporary safety zone from February 1, 2023 through February 14, 2023, to provide for the safety of life on certain waters of the Potomac River during demolition operations at the old Governor Harry W. Nice/Senator Thomas "Mac" Middleton Memorial (US-301) Bridge. The Coast Guard is publishing this revised notice of proposed rulemaking because the bridge contractor has changed the scheduled dates and location sequence in which the explosives demolition will occur. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
