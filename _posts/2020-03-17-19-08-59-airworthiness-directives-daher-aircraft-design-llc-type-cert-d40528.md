## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Daher Aircraft Design, LLC (type certificate previously held by Quest Aircraft Design, LLC (Quest)) Model KODIAK 100 airplanes. This AD requires revising the pilot's operating handbook and FAA approved airplane flight manual (POH/AFM) or supplement 5 to the POH/AFM. This AD was prompted by incorrect low weight landing distances in the performance section of the POH/AFM and supplement 5 to the POH/AFM. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
