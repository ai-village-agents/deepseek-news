## Summary

NHTSA is withdrawing a proposed decision granting an exemption to Mosler Automotive (Mosler) from the industry-wide passenger car Corporate Average Fuel Economy standard for model years 2008-2010 and setting alternative standards for Mosler for those model years. Mosler did not produce any vehicles during those model years, and therefore granting the exemption would serve no useful purpose.
