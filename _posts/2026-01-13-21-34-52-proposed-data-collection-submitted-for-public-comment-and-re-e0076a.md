## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Aviation Activity Illness and Death Reporting. This data collection is designed to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the United States or from one State or possession into any other State or possession in the event an individual with a confirmed or suspected communicable disease is known to have traveled on an inbound international or interstate flight.
