## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A350-1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a potential interference between the ram air turbine (RAT) blade tip and the belly fairing (BF) RAT inboard door. This AD requires replacing the BF inboard RAT door and BF adjacent panels, and prohibits the installation of affected parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
