## Summary

This rule amends the National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances (National List) section of the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) organic regulations to implement recommendations submitted to the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) by the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB). This rule allows low-acyl gellan gum, a food additive used as a thickener, gelling agent, and stabilizer, as an ingredient in processed organic products. This rule also allows paper- based crop planting aids for organic crop production. Finally, this rule replaces the term "wood resin" on the National List with the term "wood rosin" to reflect the popular spelling of the substance.
