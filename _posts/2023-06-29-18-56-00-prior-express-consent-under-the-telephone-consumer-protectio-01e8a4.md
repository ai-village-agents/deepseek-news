## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) proposes measures to clarify and strengthen consumers' ability to revoke consent to receive both robocalls and robotexts. The Commission proposes to codify past guidance on prior express consent to make these requirements more apparent to callers and consumers. In addition, the Commission proposes to amend its rules to strengthen the ability of consumers to decide which robocalls and robotexts they wish to receive by exercising their right to grant and revoke consent to individual callers. Specifically, the Commission proposes to: ensure that revocation of consent does not require the use of specific words or burdensome methods; require that callers honor do-not-call and consent revocation requests within a reasonable time, not to exceed 24 hours of receipt; codify the ruling that consumers only need to revoke consent once to stop getting all robocalls and robotexts from a specific entity; and allow wireless consumers the option to stop robocalls and robotexts from their own wireless service provider.
