## Summary

Massachusetts has applied to the EPA for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended. The EPA proposes to grant final authorization to Massachusetts for these revisions by a direct final rule, which can be found in the "Rules and Regulations" section of this issue of the Federal Register. We have explained the reasons for this authorization in the preamble to the direct final rule. Unless the EPA receives written comments that oppose this authorization during the comment period, the direct final rule will become effective on the date it establishes, and the EPA will not take further action on this proposal.
