## Summary

This interim rule implements certain provisions of the DOTGOV Act of 2020 applicable to GSA, which was enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. It removes provisions to the existing jurisdiction of the DOTGOV domain that had been delegated to the General Services Administration in 1997 by the Federal Networking Council with guidance in the form of internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Informational RFC 2146, which was further expanded to include State, local, or territorial government entities in 2003 by the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (IGCA). This interim rule implements provisions of the DOTGOV Act of 2020 that transfer ownership, management and operation of the DotGov Domain Program from the General Services Administration (GSA) to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).
