# Airworthiness Directives; DAHER AEROSPACE (Type Certificate Previously Held by SOCATA) Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain DAHER AEROSPACE (type certificate previously held by SOCATA) Model TBM 700 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) issued by the aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as interference between the emergency exit trim panel and the upholstery panel, which could result in additional effort required to open the emergency exit door. This proposed AD would require modification of the gripping strap, which maintains the upholstery panel on the emergency exit trim panel. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
