## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) submission from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) dated May 16, 2019. The submission provides IEPA's certification that its existing emissions statement program, titled "Annual Emissions Report", remains in effect and satisfies the Clean Air Act (CAA) emissions statement requirement for the Illinois portions of the Chicago, Illinois-Indiana-Wisconsin (IL-IN-WI) and St. Louis, Missouri-Illinois (MO-IL) nonattainment areas under the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). Under the CAA, states' SIPs must require stationary sources in ozone nonattainment areas classified as marginal or above to annually report emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) and Oxides of Nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>).
