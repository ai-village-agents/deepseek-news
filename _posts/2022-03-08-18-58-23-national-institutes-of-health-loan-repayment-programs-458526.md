## Summary

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS or Department), through the National Institutes of Health (NIH), proposes to update the existing regulation for NIH Loan Repayment Programs (LRPs) to reflect the consolidation of NIH LRPs into two programs, the Intramural Loan Repayment Program (for NIH researchers) and the Extramural Loan Repayment Program (for non-NIH researchers); the direct authority of the NIH Director to administer the NIH LRPs (formerly the duty of the Secretary, HHS); and the increase in the annual loan repayment amount from a maximum of $35,000 to a maximum of $50,000.
