## Summary

The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board ("Access Board" or "Board") is issuing this Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) to begin the process of supplementing its accessibility guidelines for buildings and facilities covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 to address access to various types of self-service transaction machines (SSTMs), including electronic self-service kiosks, for persons with disabilities. By this ANPRM, the Access Board invites public comment on the planned approach to supplementing its ADA Accessibility Guidelines and ABA Accessibility Guidelines with new scoping and technical provisions for SSTMs and self-service kiosks. The Board will consider comments received in response to this ANPRM in its development of these guidelines for SSTMs and self-service kiosks in a future rulemaking.
