## Summary

Under the authority of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the NMFS Assistant Administrator for Fisheries (Assistant Administrator) announces comparability finding determinations for all fisheries on the List of Foreign Fisheries (LOFF) for harvesting nations that export fish and fish products to the United States. Nations whose fisheries were denied comparability findings will be prohibited from importing fish and fish products from those fisheries into the United States beginning January 1, 2026. Until such time as the import restrictions imposed by this action are lifted or revised, trade restrictions on these products associated with the fisheries for which a comparability finding has been denied will continue and Certification of Admissibility will be required.
