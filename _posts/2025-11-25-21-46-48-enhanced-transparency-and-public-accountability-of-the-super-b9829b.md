## Summary

On November 18, 2025, the Board published in the Federal Register a request for public comment on the models used to conduct the Board's supervisory stress test, changes to those models to be implemented in the 2026 stress test, and proposed changes to enhance the transparency and public accountability of the Board's stress testing framework (the proposal). The Board has determined that an extension of the comment period until February 21, 2026, is appropriate.
