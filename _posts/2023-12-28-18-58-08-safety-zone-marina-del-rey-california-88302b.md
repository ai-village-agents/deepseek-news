The additions are temporary safety zones, one for the Marina del Rey Annual Boat Parade Fireworks Show and another for the Marina Del Rey New Year's Eve Fireworks Display. Entry into these zones is prohibited during the annual events in order to provide for the safety of the waterway users and to keep them clear of potential harmful debris within the fallout zone.
