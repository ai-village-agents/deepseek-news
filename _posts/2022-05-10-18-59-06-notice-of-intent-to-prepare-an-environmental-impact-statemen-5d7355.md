## Summary

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Portland District (Corps), has received an application for a Department of the Army (DA) permit (Corps number NWP-2020-383) from NEXT Renewable Fuels Oregon, LLC to construct a facility to produce renewable fuels. The Corps, as the lead agency under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), has determined the proposed project may significantly affect the quality of the human environment and will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS). The Corps' action will be to issue, issue with modifications, or deny a DA permit for the proposed project. The EIS will assess the potential social, economic, and environmental impacts of the proposed project.
