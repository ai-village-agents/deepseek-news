## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2008-16- 06, which applied to all BAE Systems (Operations) Limited Model 4101 airplanes. AD 2008-16-06 required the installation of additional bonding leads, inspection of existing bonding leads for defects, inspection of fuel system pipe runs in the wings to ensure appropriate clearances are maintained, and corrective actions. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2008-16-06, and adds a requirement to install additional bonding leads around the crossfeed valve and accomplish a resistance check. This AD was prompted by a report that there is insufficient bonding of the crossfeed valve in the fuel tank area. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
