## Summary

On March 17, 2023, FHWA published a request for comments on its existing general applicability waiver for manufactured products under its Buy America waiver authorities. Following the review and consideration of comments, FHWA is proposing to discontinue the waiver. The FHWA is also proposing standards for applying Buy America requirements to manufactured products should the waiver be discontinued. To ensure the continued effective implementation of FHWA programs that would be subject to new requirements for manufactured products, FHWA is seeking additional information on the domestic availability of specific manufactured products commonly used in FHWA- funded projects. To ensure the Agency has the most comprehensive and current information available on the domestic market for manufactured products used in FHWA infrastructure projects, FHWA is especially interested in comments detailing domestic materials sourcing, market readiness, timeliness of product supply, and other considerations.
