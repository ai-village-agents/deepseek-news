## Summary

The Office of Army Cemeteries (OAC) is honoring the requests of the family members to disinter the human remains of 6 Native American students from the Carlisle Barracks Post Cemetery, Carlisle, Pennsylvania. The decedent names are: Raleigh James from the Washoe tribe, Wade Ayres from the Catawba tribe, Anatasia Achwak(Ashowak) and Anna Vereskin from the Alaskan (Aleut) tribe, Ellen Macy from the Umqua tribe and Frank Green from the Oneida tribe. These students died between 1880 and 1910 while attending the Carlisle Indian Industrial School. At the request of the closest living relative for each decedent, OAC will disinter and facilitate the transport and reinternment of the remains in private cemeteries chosen by the families at government expense. This disinterment will be conducted in accordance with Army Regulation 290-5. This is not a Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) action because the remains are not part of a collection. They are interred in graves that are individually marked at the Carlisle Barracks Post Cemetery.
