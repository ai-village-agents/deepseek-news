## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving Tennessee's July 31, 2019, State Implementation Plan (SIP) submission pertaining to the "good neighbor" provision of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) for the 2010 1-hour sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). The good neighbor provision requires each State's implementation plan to contain adequate provisions prohibiting the interstate transport of air pollution in amounts that will contribute significantly to nonattainment, or interfere with maintenance, of a NAAQS in any other State. EPA has determined that Tennessee will not contribute significantly to nonattainment or interfere with maintenance of the 2010 1-hour SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS in any other State. Therefore, EPA is approving the July 31, 2019, SIP revision as meeting the requirements of the good neighbor provision for the 2010 1-hour SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS.
