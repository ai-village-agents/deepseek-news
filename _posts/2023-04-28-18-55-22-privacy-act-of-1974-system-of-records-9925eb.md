## Summary

Pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, the FDIC proposes to modify a current FDIC system of records notice titled FDIC-010, Investigative Files of the Office of Inspector General (OIG), by updating the categories of records in the system to include video and audio recordings; updating the categories of records in the system to include violations or potential violations of administrative or civil law within the FDIC OIG's jurisdiction; updating the system location to include secure sites and secure servers maintained by third-party service providers; and adding new routine uses to authorize sharing of information with complainants, witnesses, and subjects, and to the public and news media, in certain limited circumstances. Additionally, this notice includes non-substantive changes to simplify the formatting and text of the previously published notice. We hereby publish this notice for comment on the proposed actions.
