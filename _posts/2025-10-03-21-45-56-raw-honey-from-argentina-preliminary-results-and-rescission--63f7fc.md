The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily determines that Asociaci[oacute]n De Cooperativas Argentinas Cooperativa Limitada (ACA), NEXCO S.A. (NEXCO), and certain companies not selected for individual examination for which a review was requested made sales of raw honey from at less than normal value (NV) during the period of review (POR), June 1, 2023, through May 31, 2024.
