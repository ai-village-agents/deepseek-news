## Summary

The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) hosted a virtual, open, public listening session, on December 17, 2020, with remote participation only, for public input about water quantity in the western United States as it relates to existing NRCS programs. NRCS provided stakeholders both an opportunity to give oral testimony during the listening session and a 30-day public comment period for additional input. NRCS received comments from 66 stakeholders, including representatives from national organizations, individuals or organizations from 13 western States, and one Indian Tribe. This notice responds to comments received during the listening session and the subsequent public comment period, which closed on January 19, 2021, and identifies the actions that NRCS has taken and will be taking in the months ahead.
