## Summary

This action extends the prohibition against certain flight operations in the Pyongyang Flight Information Region (FIR) (ZKKP) by all: U.S. air carriers; U.S. commercial operators; persons exercising the privileges of an airman certificate issued by the FAA, except when such persons are operating U.S.-registered aircraft for a foreign air carrier; and operators of U.S.-registered civil aircraft, except when the operator of such aircraft is a foreign air carrier, for an additional five years, from September 18, 2023, until September 18, 2028. The FAA finds this action necessary to address significant safety-of-flight risks to U.S. civil aviation associated with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK's) military capabilities and activities. The FAA also republishes the approval process and exemption information for this Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR), consistent with other recently published flight prohibition SFARs.
