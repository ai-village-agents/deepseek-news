## Summary

The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) proposes to amend our Audit Standards regulations. The proposed rule will amend the regulations to eliminate the Commission waiver requirement for reviewed financial statements and allow all operations grossing less than $2 million in the previous fiscal year to submit reviewed financial statements provided that the tribe or tribal gaming regulatory authority (TGRA) permits the gaming operation to submit reviewed financials. The proposed amendment to the rule will also create a third tier of financial reporting for charitable gaming operations with annual gross revenues of $50,000 or less where, if permitted by the tribe, a charitable gaming operation may submit financial information on a monthly basis to the tribe or the TGRA and in turn, the tribe or TGRA provides an annual certification to the NIGC regarding the charitable gaming operation's compliance with the financial reporting. The proposed amendment also adds a provision clarifying that the submission of an adverse opinion does not satisfy the regulation's reporting requirements.
