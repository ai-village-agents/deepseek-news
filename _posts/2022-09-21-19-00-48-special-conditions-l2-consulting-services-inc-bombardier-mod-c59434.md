## Summary

These special conditions are issued for the Bombardier Model CL-600-2B16 (604 variant) airplane. This airplane, as modified by L2 Consulting Services, Inc., will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for airplanes. This design feature is associated with the installation of an electronic network system architecture that will allow increased connectivity to and access from external network sources, (e.g., operator networks, wireless devices, internet connectivity, service provider satellite communications, electronic flight bags, etc.) to the airplane's previously isolated electronic assets (networks, systems, and databases). The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
