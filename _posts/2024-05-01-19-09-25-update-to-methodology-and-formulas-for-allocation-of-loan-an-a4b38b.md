## Summary

The Rural Business-Cooperative Service, Rural Housing Service, and Rural Utilities Service (RBCS, RHS, RUS, or collectively referred to as the Agency), of the Rural Development (RD) mission area within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), is issuing this final rule to update the data it uses to determine a State's percentage of national nonmetropolitan unemployment income.
