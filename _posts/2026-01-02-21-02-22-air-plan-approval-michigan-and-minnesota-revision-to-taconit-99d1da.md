## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing nitrogen oxide (NO<INF>X</INF>) and/or sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) limits for the indurating furnaces at five taconite facilities in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) addressing the requirement for best available retrofit technology (BART) at taconite facilities. EPA is also modifying the Upper Predictive Limit (UPL) equations used to establish NO<INF>X</INF> and SO<INF>2</INF> emission limits under the FIP. Finally, the EPA is revising reporting provisions to require reports be submitted to the EPA electronically. The EPA is finalizing these actions pursuant to Clean Air Act (CAA) sections 110 and 169A.
