## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Pilatus Aircraft Ltd. (Pilatus) Model PC-24 airplanes. This proposed AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as the engine attachment hardware not conforming to the approved design, which could affect the structural integrity of the airplane. This proposed AD would require inspecting the engine attachment hardware for missing washers and loose nuts and taking corrective actions as necessary. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
