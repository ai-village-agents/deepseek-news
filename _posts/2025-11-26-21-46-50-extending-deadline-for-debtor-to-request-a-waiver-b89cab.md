## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is finalizing, with technical changes, a proposed rule to amend the time period that a debtor has to request a waiver from 180 days to one year, as mandated by the Cleland Dole Act. Generally, VA is authorized to not recover debts related to benefits payments or overpayments where recovery would be against good conscience and an application for relief is made within the required time period. Allowing an additional six months to request a waiver reduces pressure on veterans by easing the compliance burden.
