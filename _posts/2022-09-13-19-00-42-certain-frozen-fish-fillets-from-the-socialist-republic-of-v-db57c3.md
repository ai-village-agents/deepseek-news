## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) determines that 15 companies had no shipments of certain frozen fish fillets from the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (Vietnam) during the period of review (POR) August 1, 2020, through July 31, 2021. Commerce also determines that one company subject to this review is part of the Vietnam-wide entity because it did not demonstrate eligibility for a separate rate.
