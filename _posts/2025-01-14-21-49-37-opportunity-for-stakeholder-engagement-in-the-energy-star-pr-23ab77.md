## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing an opportunity for public input on ENERGY STAR product specification development activities. Since its creation in 1992, the ENERGY STAR program has grown to designate highly efficient products in more than 75 categories, all of which are independently certified. EPA relies on broad stakeholder engagement to develop and maintain its ENERGY STAR product specifications and grow and evolve the products portfolio. Through its products work, the Agency also looks for innovative ways to accelerate market movement to greater efficiency.
