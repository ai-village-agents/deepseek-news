## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing an Environmental Assessment (EA) and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) in support of the NRC's consideration of a June 30, 2022, Waste Control Specialists LLC (WCS) request for a superseding Order to its current (2014) NRC Order (as supplemented by subsequent NRC letters to WCS from 2016 to 2022). In its letter, WCS requested authorization to (1) move the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Waste at the WCS Site from its current location at the WCS Federal Waste Facility (FWF) disposal cell to another location at the WCS Site, the WCS Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facility (TSDF) Bin Storage Area (BSA)-1 Enclosure, (2) prepare the LANL Waste in the WCS TSDF BSA-1 Enclosure for shipment (e.g., replace lifting straps for Standard Waste Boxes (SWBs), replace filter vents in SWBs, perform borescope in SWBs, take air samples from head space in SWBs), and (3) temporarily store the LANL Waste in the WCS TSDF BSA-1 Enclosure until the DOE ships the LANL Waste off the WCS Site to a future DOE determined location, which is currently expected to be either the DOE LANL or the DOE Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) Facility.
