## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the New York State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone concerning the control of oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>). The EPA is proposing to approve a SIP revision of a New York regulation that lowers allowable NO<INF>X</INF> emissions from simple cycle and regenerative combustion turbines during the ozone season. The lower emissions from these sources will help to address Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements, ozone nonattainment, and protect the health of New York State residents.
