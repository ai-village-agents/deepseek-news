## Summary

NMFS is closing the directed longfin squid fishery through the remainder of 2023 Trimester II (May 1-August 31, 2023). This closure is required by regulation because NMFS projects that 90 percent of the longfin squid Trimester II quota will be caught by the effective date. This action is necessary to comply with the regulations implementing the Mackerel, Squid, and Butterfish Fishery Management Plan and is intended to prevent overharvest of longfin squid.
