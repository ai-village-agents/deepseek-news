## Summary

This rule is proposing to expand access for certain small business concerns in varying circumstances to the U.S. General Services Administration's (GSA) Federal Surplus Personal Property Donation Program in accordance with the Recovery Improvements for Small Entities After Disaster Act of 2015 (RISE Act), the Veterans Small Business Enhancement Act, and the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (NDAA). The statutes provide that small businesses in disaster areas, veteran-owned small businesses, and small business concerns located in Puerto Rico, respectively, should be considered for surplus personal property distributions. SBA, in coordination with GSA, is proposing certain procedures for determining which firms may participate in GSA's existing surplus personal property Program, and under what conditions.
