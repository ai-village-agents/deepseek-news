## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Pilatus Aircraft Ltd. (Pilatus) Model PC-12/47E airplanes. This proposed AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as corrosion of the actuator attachment lug areas underneath the anti-rotation pads of the main landing gear (MLG) and nose landing gear (NLG). This proposed AD would require replacing certain MLG and NLG electro-mechanical actuators. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
