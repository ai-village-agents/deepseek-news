## Summary

Section 808(1) of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA or Act) prohibits debt collectors from collecting any amount (including any interest, fee, charge, or expense incidental to the principal obligation) unless that amount is expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or permitted by law. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issues this advisory opinion to affirm that this provision prohibits debt collectors from collecting pay-to-pay or "convenience" fees, such as fees imposed for making a payment online or by phone, when those fees are not expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or expressly authorized by law. This advisory opinion also clarifies that a debt collector may also violate section 808(1) when the debt collector collects pay-to-pay fees through a third-party payment processor.
