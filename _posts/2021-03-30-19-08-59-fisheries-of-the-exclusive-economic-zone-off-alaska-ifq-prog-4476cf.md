## Summary

NMFS issues this temporary rule (referred to herein as "emergency rule") to modify the temporary transfer provision of the Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) Program for the fixed-gear commercial Pacific halibut and sablefish fisheries for the 2021 IFQ fishing year. This emergency rule is intended to provide flexibility to quota share (QS) holders in 2021, while preserving the Program's long-standing objective of maintaining an owner-operated IFQ fishery in future years. This emergency rule will not modify other provisions of the IFQ Program. This emergency rule is intended to promote the goals and objectives of the IFQ Program, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Northern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982, and other applicable laws.
