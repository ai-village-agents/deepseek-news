## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) debarring David J. Kempema for a period of 5 years from importing or offering for import any drug into the United States. FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Kempema was convicted of one felony count under Federal law which FDA has determined is for conduct relating to the importation into the United States of a drug or controlled substance. The factual basis supporting Mr. Kempema's conviction is described in further detail below. Mr. Kempema was given notice of the proposed debarment and was given an opportunity to request a hearing to show why he should not be debarred. As of September 14, 2022 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Mr. Kempema had not responded. Mr. Kempema's failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this matter.
