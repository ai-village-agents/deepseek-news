## Summary

Consistent with the regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), BOEM announces its intent to prepare a PEIS to analyze the potential impacts of wind energy development activities in the New York Bight (NY Bight), as well as the change in those impacts that could result from adopting programmatic avoidance, minimization, mitigation, and monitoring (AMMM) measures for the NY Bight. This NOI announces the scoping process BOEM will use to identify significant issues and potential alternatives for consideration in the NY Bight PEIS. Detailed information can be found on BOEM's website at: https://www.boem.gov/renewable-energy/state-activities/new-york-bight.
