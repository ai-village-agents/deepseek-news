# Expansion of the Rental Subsidy Policy for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Applicants and Recipients

## Summary

We propose to revise our regulations by applying nationwide the In-Kind Support and Maintenance (ISM) rental subsidy exception that is currently in place for SSI applicants and recipients residing in seven States. The exception recognizes that a "business arrangement" exists when the amount of required monthly rent for a property equals or exceeds the presumed maximum value. This proposed rule would improve nationwide program uniformity, and, we expect, improve equality in the application of the rental subsidy policy.
