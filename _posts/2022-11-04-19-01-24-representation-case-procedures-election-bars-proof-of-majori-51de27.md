## Summary

As part of its ongoing efforts to more effectively administer the National Labor Relations Act (the Act or the NLRA) and to further the purposes of the Act, the National Labor Relations Board (the Board) proposes to rescind and replace amendments that the Board made in April 2020 to its rules and regulations governing the filing and processing of petitions for a Board-conducted representation election while unfair labor practice charges are pending, and following an employer's voluntary recognition of a union as the majority-supported collective- bargaining representative of the employer's employees. The Board also proposes to rescind an amendment governing the filing and processing of petitions for a Board-conducted representation election in the construction industry. The Board believes, subject to comments, that these proposed changes will better protect employees' statutory right to freely choose whether to be represented by a labor organization, promote industrial peace, and encourage the practice and procedure of collective bargaining.
