## Summary

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) at the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) intends to request approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to establish a new umbrella generic clearance to request information while engaging individuals and groups who could provide valuable information to inform ACF programs and work, including but not limited to those who are served or have been served by ACF, those with expertise in ACF program areas, and individuals invested in the outcomes of ACF research and evaluation. These engagement activities often need to be conducted quickly, to allow for sufficient time to inform project direction and decision-making. Additionally, planning for engagement activities is most often on a quick timeline and the standard timeline to comply with a full request under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) often inhibits the ability to collect information to inform these activities. Therefore, an umbrella generic is necessary to allow for quick turnaround requests for similar information collections related to these activities.
