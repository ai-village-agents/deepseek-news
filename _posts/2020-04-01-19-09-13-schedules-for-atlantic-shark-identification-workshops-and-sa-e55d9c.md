## Summary

NMFS announces that the date for the Atlantic Shark Identification workshop originally scheduled for April 2, 2020, in Wilmington, NC has been changed to July 2, 2020. Also, NMFS is postponing the Safe Handling, Release, and Identification workshops originally scheduled for Houston, TX on March 17, 2020; Kitty Hawk, NC on April 1, 2020; and Revere, MA on April 3, 2020. The dates for these workshops have been changed to June 26, 2020, June 29, 2020, and June 16, 2020, respectively. The dates are being changed due to concerns about the spread of the COVID-19 virus associated with traveling to, and attending, the originally scheduled workshops. The workshop times and locations remains unchanged: 12 p.m.-4 p.m. for the Atlantic Shark Identification workshop; and, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. for the Safe Handling, Release, and Identification workshops. The remaining workshops in May and June 2020 remain unchanged, unless further noticed. Atlantic Shark Identification workshops are mandatory for federally-permitted Atlantic shark dealers. Safe Handling, Release, and Identification workshops are mandatory for shark and swordfish limited-access permit holders who fish with longline or gillnet gear. Additional free workshops will be conducted during 2020.
