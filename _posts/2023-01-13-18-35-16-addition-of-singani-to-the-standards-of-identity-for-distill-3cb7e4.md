## Summary

This final rule amends the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau regulations that set forth the standards of identity for distilled spirits to include "Singani" as a type of brandy that is a distinctive product of Bolivia. This amendment follows a joint petition submitted by the Plurinational State of Bolivia and Singani 63, Inc., and subsequent discussions with the Office of the United States Trade Representative.
