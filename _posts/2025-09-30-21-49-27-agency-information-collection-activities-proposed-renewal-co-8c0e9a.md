## Summary

As part of its continuing efforts to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, FinCEN invites comments on the proposed renewal, without change, of existing information collection requirements found in Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) regulations concerning information sharing between government agencies and financial institutions. Specifically, the regulations require that, upon receiving an information request from FinCEN, a financial institution must search its records to determine whether it maintains or has maintained any account or engaged in any transaction with an individual, entity, or organization named in the request. If a financial institution identifies an account or transaction named in the request, it must report such information to FinCEN in the manner and timeframe specified in the request. This request for comment is being made pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
