## Summary

This final rule codifies Onshore Order 1--Approval of Operations; Onshore Order 2--Drilling Operations on Federal and Indian Oil and Gas Leases; Onshore Order 6--Hydrogen Sulfide Operations; and Onshore Order 7--Disposal of Produced Water. This rule places the existing regulations, which were promulgated over the years through various notice and comment rulemakings but not codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), into the CFR in their entirety without making any substantive changes.
