## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is hosting a hybrid public meeting to discuss proposed recommendations for the reauthorization of the Biosimilar User Fee Act (BsUFA) for fiscal years (FYs) 2028 through 2032. The BsUFA authorizes FDA to collect user fees to support the process for the review of biosimilar biological products. The current legislative authority for BsUFA expires in September 2027. At that time, new legislation will be required for FDA to continue collecting user fees in future fiscal years. FDA begins the BsUFA reauthorization process by publishing a notice in the Federal Register requesting public input and holding a public meeting where the public may present its views on the reauthorization. FDA invites public comment as the Agency begins the process to reauthorize the program for FYs 2028 through 2032. These comments will be published and available on FDA's website.
