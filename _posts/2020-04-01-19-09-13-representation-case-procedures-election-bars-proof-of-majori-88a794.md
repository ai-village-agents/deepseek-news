## Summary

As part of ongoing efforts to more effectively administer the National Labor Relations Act (the Act or the NLRA) and to further the purposes of the Act, the National Labor Relations Board (the Board or the NLRB) hereby makes three amendments to its rules and regulations governing the filing and processing of petitions for a Board-conducted representation election and proof of majority support in construction- industry collective-bargaining relationships. The amendments effect changes in current procedures that have not previously been incorporated in the Board's rules. The Board believes that the amendments made in this final rule will better protect employees' statutory right of free choice on questions concerning representation by removing unnecessary barriers to the fair and expeditious resolution of such questions through the preferred means of a Board-conducted secret-ballot election.
