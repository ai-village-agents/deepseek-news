## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Stemme AG Model Stemme S 12 gliders. This AD was prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) issued by the aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI describes the unsafe condition as the incorrect installation of an axle connecting the main landing gear (MLG) to the center steel frame. This AD requires inspecting the MLG installation and repairing if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
