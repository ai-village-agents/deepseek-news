## Summary

This document gives notice of a proposed amendment to Prohibited Transaction Exemption 2002-51, an exemption for certain transactions identified in the Department's Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program (VFC Program or VFCP). The VFC Program allows persons who may have engaged in a breach of fiduciary duty under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) to correct the breach and avoid certain Department of Labor-initiated civil actions and assessment of civil penalties. PTE 2002-51 (the VFCP Class Exemption) is a related class exemption that provides an exemption from excise taxes imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for certain eligible transactions corrected pursuant to the VFC Program. This amendment to the VFCP Class Exemption is being proposed in connection with the Department's amendment and restatement of the VFC Program, published elsewhere in today's issue of the Federal Register (2022 Program Notice). If granted, the amendment to the VFCP Class Exemption would affect plans, participants and beneficiaries of such plans, and certain other persons engaging in such transactions.
