## Summary

The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a semi- autonomous agency within the Department of Energy (DOE), is amending its prior decision to disposition up to 350 kilograms (kg) of foreign Gap Material Plutonium from preparation for emplacement in the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) to disposition using an electrolytic dissolver in H-Canyon, vitrification with high level radioactive waste (HLW) at the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF), and storage at Savannah River Site (SRS) until a geologic repository is available. NNSA has determined through feasibility and process technology studies that this disposition path could be performed at a substantially lower cost than preparation for disposal at WIPP. NNSA has prepared a Supplement Analysis (SA) to inform this amended decision and has determined that no additional National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review is necessary.
