## Summary

We announce our intention to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to prepare proposed regulations for Federal programs authorized under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). The committee will include representatives of organizations or groups with interests that are significantly affected by the subject matter of the proposed regulations. We request nominations for individual negotiators who represent key stakeholder constituencies for the issues to be negotiated to serve on the committee. We also announce the creation of a subcommittee, and request nominations for individuals with pertinent expertise to participate on the subcommittee. The Department has also set a schedule for committee meetings.
