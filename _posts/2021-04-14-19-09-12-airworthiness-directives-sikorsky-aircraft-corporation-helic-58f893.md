## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-04-16 which applied to certain Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (Sikorsky) Model S-92A helicopters. AD 2021-04-16 required a one-time inspection of the landing gear for components with non-conforming threads and removal of any non-conforming threaded hinge pin and main landing gear (MLG) and nose landing gear (NLG) actuator pins. AD 2021-04-16 also prohibited installing certain part-numbered hinge and actuator pins on any helicopter. This AD requires the same actions but corrects erroneous part numbers. This AD was prompted by the discovery that certain part numbers listed in AD 2021-04-16 are incorrect. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
