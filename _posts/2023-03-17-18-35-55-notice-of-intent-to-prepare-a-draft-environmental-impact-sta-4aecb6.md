## Summary

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District (USACE), intends to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for the proposed Project. The Project is proposed due to the planned expansion of the Bingham Canyon Mine (Mine), a commercial open pit copper mining operation near Magna, Salt Lake County, Utah. Kennecott Utah Copper LLC (Applicant) has applied for a Department of the Army (DA) permit for discharges of dredged or fill materials into 44.86 acres of waters of United States, including wetlands, to construct the Project. This notice opens the public scoping phase and invites interested parties to identify issues and reasonable alternatives to the proposed action that should be considered in the EIS.
