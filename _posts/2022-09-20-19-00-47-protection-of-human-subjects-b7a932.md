## Summary

The Corporation for National and Community Service (operating as AmeriCorps) is proposing to adopt the Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects (referred to as the Common Rule). The Common Rule outlines the basic ethical principles and procedures that an agency will abide by when conducting or sponsoring research involving human subjects. Among the procedures required by the Common Rule are use of institutional review boards (IRBs), obtaining informed consent of research subjects, and requiring submission of assurances of compliance with the rule. AmeriCorps is proposing to make the Common Rule applicable to itself, meaning that all research involving human subjects conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by AmeriCorps will be subject to the Common Rule's ethical principles and procedures.
