## Summary

On January 2, 2024, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) published a final rule requiring terminating mobile wireless providers to block text messages from a particular number following notification from the Commission. The Commission also codified that the National Do-Not-Call (DNC) Registry's protections extend to text messages. An amendment in the final rule with a delayed effective date provided an incomplete revision of a certain paragraph. This document corrects that amendatory instruction.
