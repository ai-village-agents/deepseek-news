## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew Information Collection 2120-0776. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on February 18, 2022. The FAA proposes renewal of the collection of information related to requests to operate small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) in controlled airspace. FAA will use the collected information to make determinations whether to authorize or deny the requested authorization of sUAS operation in controlled airspace. The proposed information collection is necessary to issue such authorizations or denials consistent with the FAA's mandate to ensure safe and efficient use of national airspace.
