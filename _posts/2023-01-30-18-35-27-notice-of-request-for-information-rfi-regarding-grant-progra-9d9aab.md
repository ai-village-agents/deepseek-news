## Summary

The Department of Energy (DOE) Grid Deployment Office (GDO) invites public input for its Request for Information (RFI) regarding issues related to the provision of grants to facilitate the siting of interstate and offshore electricity transmission lines, as authorized under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This provision of the IRA authorizes the issuance of grants to siting authorities to facilitate the siting of interstate and offshore electricity transmission lines and to siting authorities and State, local, and Tribal governments to undertake economic development activities for communities impacted by such projects. Information collected from this RFI will be used by DOE for program planning purposes and the potential development of a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA).
