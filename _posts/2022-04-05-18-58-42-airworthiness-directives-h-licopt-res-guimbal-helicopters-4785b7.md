## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-02- 20, which applied to certain H[eacute]licopt[egrave]res Guimbal (HG) Model Cabri G2 helicopters. AD 2021-02-20 required initial and repetitive inspections of certain rotating and non-rotating scissor fittings, and depending on the results, replacing the affected assembly. AD 2021-02-20 also prohibited installing certain main rotor hubs (MRHs) and swashplate guides unless the initial inspection was accomplished. This AD was prompted by a report of a crack in a rotating scissor fitting. This AD retains certain requirements of AD 2021-02-20, and requires installation of newly designed parts, provides a terminating action for the initial and repetitive inspections, and revises the applicability. This AD also extends the repetitive inspection interval and prohibits installing certain MRHs and swashplate guides. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
