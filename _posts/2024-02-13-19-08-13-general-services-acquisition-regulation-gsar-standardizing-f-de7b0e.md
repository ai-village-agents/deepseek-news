## Summary

On January 12, 2024, GSA published a final rule amending the General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation (GSAR) to clarify when GSAR clauses apply to Federal Supply Schedule contracts. Some text inadvertently appeared in a section revision, and inadvertently omitted amendatory text. This correction removes that text and adds the omitted language.
