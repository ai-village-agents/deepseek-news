In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on July 21, 2025. The collection involves the filing of a complaint with the FAA alleging a violation of any requirement, rule, regulation, or order issued under certain statutes within the jurisdiction of the FAA. The FAA will use the information collected to determine if the alleged violation warrants investigation or action.
