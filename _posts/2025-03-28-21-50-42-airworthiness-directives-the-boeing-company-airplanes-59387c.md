## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 777-200LR Series and 777-300ER Series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of chafing and arcing damage on the light emitting diode (LED) sidewall wire bundles. This proposed AD would require a general visual inspection (GVI) of the sidewall light for chafing damage and applicable on- condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
