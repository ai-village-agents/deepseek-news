## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve, as a revision of the Nevada state implementation plan (SIP), the State's second 10-year plan for maintaining the 1997 8- hour ozone standard in Clark County ("Clark County Second Maintenance Plan" or "Plan"). The Clark County Second Maintenance Plan includes, among other elements, a base year emissions inventory, a maintenance demonstration, contingency provisions, and motor vehicle emissions budgets for use in transportation conformity determinations to ensure the continued maintenance of the 1997 National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone ("1997 ozone NAAQS" or "1997 8-hour ozone standard"). With this action, the EPA is approving the motor vehicle emissions budgets for 2017, 2023, and 2033. The EPA is taking this final action because the SIP revision meets the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements for such plans and motor vehicle emissions budgets.
