## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class D and Class E airspace and remove Class E airspace at Kalamazoo, MI. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of an airspace review due to the decommissioning of the Kalamazoo very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimum Operating Network (MON) Program. The geographic coordinates of Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport and the name of the Borgess Medical Center Helipad would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
