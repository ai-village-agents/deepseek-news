# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model AS-350B, AS 350BA, AS 350B1, AS 350B2, AS 350B3, and AS-350D helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of non-conformity of a certain cargo hook. This proposed AD would require inspecting the gap between the filler and the side plates of the affected cargo hook and, depending on the results, replacing the cargo hook. This proposed AD would also prohibit installing an affected cargo hook on any helicopter. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
