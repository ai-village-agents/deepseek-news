## Summary

This document amends U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regulations to reflect an extension of import restrictions on certain categories of archaeological material of the Italian Republic (Italy). The restrictions, which were originally imposed by Treasury Decision 01-06 and last extended by CBP Decision (CBP Dec.) 16-02, are due to expire on January 12, 2021. The Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States Department of State, has made the requisite determination for extending the import restrictions that previously existed and entered into a new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Italy to reflect the extension of these import restrictions. The new MOU supersedes the existing MOU that was entered into on January 19, 2001, and previously extended, most recently until January 12, 2021. Accordingly, these import restrictions will remain in effect for an additional five years, and the CBP regulations are being amended to reflect this extension until January 12, 2026. CBP Dec. 11-03 contains the amended Designated List of archaeological material of Italy to which the restrictions apply.
