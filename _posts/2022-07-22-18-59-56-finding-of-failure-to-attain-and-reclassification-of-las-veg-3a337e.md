## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to determine that the Las Vegas, Nevada nonattainment area ("Las Vegas") for the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) failed to attain by its applicable "Marginal" area attainment date of August 3, 2021. The effect of failing to attain by the attainment date is that Las Vegas will be reclassified by operation of law to "Moderate" upon the effective date of the final reclassification notice. Consequently, the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) must submit state implementation plan (SIP) revisions required to satisfy the statutory and regulatory requirements for Moderate areas for the 2015 ozone NAAQS. The EPA is proposing deadlines for submission of those SIP revisions and implementation of the related control requirements. This action, if finalized as proposed, will fulfill the EPA's statutory obligation to determine whether the Las Vegas ozone nonattainment area attained the NAAQS by the attainment date.
