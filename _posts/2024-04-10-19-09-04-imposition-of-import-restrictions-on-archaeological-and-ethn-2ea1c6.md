## Summary

This document amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regulations to reflect the imposition of import restrictions on archaeological and ethnological materials from the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (Pakistan). These restrictions are imposed pursuant to an agreement between the United States and Pakistan, entered into under the authority of the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act. This document amends the CBP regulations, adding Pakistan to the list of countries which have bilateral agreements with the United States imposing cultural property import restrictions, and contains the Designated List, which describes the archaeological and ethnological materials to which the restrictions apply.
