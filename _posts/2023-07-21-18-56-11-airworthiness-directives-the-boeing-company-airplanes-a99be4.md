## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 757-200, 757-200CB, and 757-300 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by cracks on both sides of the airplane at certain stringers. This proposed AD would require an inspection or a maintenance records check for existing liner holes at certain stringers, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
