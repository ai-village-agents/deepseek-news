## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-2B16 (604 Variant) airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report indicating that a new filter plate connector for the nose wheel steering (NWS) system electronic control module (ECM) does not meet certain certification requirements. This AD requires replacing all affected ECMs. This AD also prohibits the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
