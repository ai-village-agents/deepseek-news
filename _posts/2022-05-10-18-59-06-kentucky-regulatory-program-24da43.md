## Summary

We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), are approving, subject to certain limitations discussed below, an amendment to the Kentucky regulatory program (Kentucky program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). The regulatory provisions we are approving establish new bond requirements for providing sufficient financial assurances for the long-term treatment of unanticipated pollutional discharges at permitted sites. Consequently, we are removing a required amendment that we imposed in 2018 regarding financial assurance for the long-term treatment of discharges. We are also approving revisions to other various bond requirements.
