## Summary

NMFS is reducing the Atlantic herring possession limit for herring vessels fishing with midwater trawl in the River Herring and Shad Cape Cod Catch Cap Closure Area. This is required because NMFS projects that catch of river herring and shad by midwater trawl herring vessels will reach the Cape Cod Catch Cap threshold for river herring and shad before the end of the fishing year. This action is intended to prevent overharvest of river herring and shad.
