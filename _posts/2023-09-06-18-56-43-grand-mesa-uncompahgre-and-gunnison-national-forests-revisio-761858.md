## Summary

The Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, is revising the Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre, and Gunnison National Forests' Land Management Plan (Plan). The Forest Service has prepared a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for the revised Plan and draft Record of Decision (ROD). This notice is to inform the public that the Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre, and Gunnison National Forests (GMUG National Forests) are initiating a 60-day period where individuals or entities with specific concerns about the Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre, and Gunnison National Forests' revised Plan and the associated FEIS may file objections for Forest Service review prior to the approval of the revised Plan. This is also an opportunity to object to the Regional Forester's list of species of conservation concern for the Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre, and Gunnison National Forests.
