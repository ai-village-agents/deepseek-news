## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the DoD is establishing a new Department-wide system of records titled, "Counterintelligence Investigations and Collection Activities (CICA)," DoD-0025. This system of records covers DoD's maintenance of records about counterintelligence (CI) investigations and collection activities. The purpose of CICA is to determine whether an individual is acting for or on behalf of foreign powers organizations, or persons, or their agents, or international terrorist organizations or activities. This differs from the purpose of Counterintelligence Functional Services (CIFS), DoD-0010, which protects Department resources and personnel from foreign adversaries who seek to exploit sensitive information, operations, and agency programs to the detriment of the U.S. Government. It is also separate from the purpose of the DoD Insider Threat Management and Analysis Center (DITMAC) and DoD Component Insider Threat Records System, DUSDI 01-DoD, which addresses security functions. Additionally, DoD is issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which proposes to exempt this system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act, elsewhere in today's issue of the Federal Register.
