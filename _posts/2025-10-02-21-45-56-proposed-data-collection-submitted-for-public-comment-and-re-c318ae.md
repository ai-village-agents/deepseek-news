The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled NCEH DLS Laboratory Quality Assurance Programs. The Division of Laboratory Science (DLS) provides quality assurance in the form of quality control samples and technical assistance to laboratories to improve analytical accuracy and reliability of tests, allowing CDC to assess performance.
