## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering issuance of an amendment to Renewed Facility License No. DPR-26, issued to Holtec Decommissioning International, LLC (HDI), on behalf of Holtec Indian Point 2, LLC, for Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit No. 2. The proposed amendment would modify the Indian Point Unit 2 (IP2) staffing requirements, prohibit the transfer of Indian Point Unit 3 (IP3) spent fuel to the IP2 spent fuel pool (SFP), and prohibit storing spent fuel in the IP2 SFP. This change would support transfer of the spent fuel from the IP2 SFP to dry storage within an independent spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI) as part of ongoing decommissioning activities at the Indian Point Energy Center (IPEC).
