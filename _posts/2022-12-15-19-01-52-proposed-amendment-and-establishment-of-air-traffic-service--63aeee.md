## Summary

This action proposes to amend VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-169, V-170, and V-430, and Area Navigation (RNAV) route T-331; and establish RNAV route T-475. The FAA is proposing this action due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Devils Lake, ND (DVL), VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) navigational aid (NAVAID). The Devils Lake VOR is being decommissioned in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
