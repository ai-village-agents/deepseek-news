## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-19-06, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A330-202, -243, - 243F, -302, -323, and -343 airplanes. AD 2019-19-06 requires an inspection to determine the part number and serial number of the slat geared rotary actuators (SGRAs), and replacement of each affected SGRA with a serviceable part. Since the FAA issued AD 2019-19-06, it was determined that the requirements of AD 2019-19-06 may not ensure the permanent removal from service of affected SGRAs. This proposed AD would continue to require replacement of each affected SGRA with a serviceable part, and would expand the applicability to include all airplanes on which the affected part may be installed. This proposed AD would also prohibit installation of an affected part, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
