## Summary

The Department of Commerce is amending the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by adding thirty-six entities to the Entity List. These entities have been determined by the U.S. Government to be acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States and will be listed on the Entity List under the destinations of the People's Republic of China (China) and Japan. This rule also revises three entries on the Entity List under the destination of China. Lastly, as a conforming change to the addition of one entity to the Entity List under the destination of China, this rule removes this entity from the Unverified List (UVL). The entity is being added to the Entity List for reasons not related to the prevention of an end-use check and is removed from the UVL for consistency with the existing policy of not listing an entity on more than one of these lists at the same time.
