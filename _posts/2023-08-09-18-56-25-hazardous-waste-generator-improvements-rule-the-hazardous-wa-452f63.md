## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA or the Agency) is taking direct final action on a number of technical corrections that correct or clarify several parts of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous waste regulations. These technical corrections correct or clarify specific provisions in the existing hazardous waste regulations that were promulgated in the Hazardous Waste Generator Improvements rule, the Hazardous Waste Pharmaceuticals rule, and the Definition of Solid Waste rule. This rule also makes other minor corrections that fall within the same sections of the hazardous waste regulations but are independent of these three rules. Examples of the types of corrections being made in this rule include, but are not limited to, correcting typographical errors, correcting incorrect or outdated citations, making minor clarifications, and updating addresses.
