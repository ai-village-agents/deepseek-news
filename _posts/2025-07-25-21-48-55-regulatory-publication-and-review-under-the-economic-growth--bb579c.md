## Summary

Pursuant to the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 (EGRPRA), the OCC, Board, and FDIC (collectively, the agencies) are reviewing agency regulations to identify outdated or otherwise unnecessary regulatory requirements on insured depository institutions and their holding companies. Since February 2024, the agencies published three Federal Register documents requesting comment on multiple categories of regulations. This fourth Federal Register document requests comment on the final three categories of regulations: Banking Operations, Capital, and the Community Reinvestment Act, and agency rules issued in final form as of July 25, 2025, including those covered by the three prior documents.
