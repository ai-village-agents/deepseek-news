## Summary

The Coast Guard will establish a safety zone that would restrict certain vessels from entering or transiting through certain navigable waters in the Miami River and Ports of Miami, Everglades, Palm Beach and Fort Pierce during periods of reduced or restricted visibility due to tropical storm force winds (39-73 mph/34-63 knots), hurricanes and/or other disasters. This action is necessary for the safety of life on these navigable waters within the Sector Miami Captain of the Port (COTP) zone.
