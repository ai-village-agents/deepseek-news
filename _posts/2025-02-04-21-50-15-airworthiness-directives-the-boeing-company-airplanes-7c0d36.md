## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-14- 13, which applies to all The Boeing Company Model 767-200, -300, -300F, and -400ER series airplanes. AD 2019-14-13 required identifying the part number, and the serial number if applicable, of the Captain's and First Officer's seats, and performing applicable on-condition actions for affected seats. AD 2019-14-13 also required a one-time detailed inspection and repetitive checks of the horizontal movement system (HMS) of the Captain's and First Officer's seats, and applicable on- condition actions. AD 2019-14-13 also provided an optional terminating action for the repetitive actions for certain seats. This AD was prompted by reports of uncommanded fore and aft movement of the Captain's and First Officer's seats. This AD retains the actions in AD 2019-14-13 and adds an inspection of previously omitted part numbers. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
