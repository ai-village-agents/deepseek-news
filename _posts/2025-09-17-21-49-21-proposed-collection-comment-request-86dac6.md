## Summary

In accordance with the requirement of Section 3506 (c)(2)(A) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 which provides opportunity for public comment on new or revised data collections, the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) will publish periodic summaries of proposed data collections. Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the proposed information collection is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the RRB's estimate of the burden of the collection of the information; (c) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden related to the collection of information on respondents, including the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology. Title and purpose of information collection: Application for Survivor Death Benefits; OMB 3220-0031. Under Section 6 of the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) (45 U.S.C. 231e), lump-sum death benefits are payable to surviving widow(er)s, children, and certain other dependents. Lump-sum death benefits are payable after the death of a railroad employee only if there are no qualified survivors of the employee immediately eligible for annuities. With the exception of the residual death benefit, eligibility for survivor benefits depends on whether the deceased employee was "insured" under the RRA at the time of death. If the deceased employee was not insured, jurisdiction of any survivor benefits payable is transferred to the Social Security Administration and survivor benefits are paid by that agency instead of the RRB. The requirements for applying for benefits are prescribed in 20 CFR 217, 219, and 234. The collection obtains the information required by the RRB to determine entitlement to and amount of the survivor death benefits applied for. To collect the information, the RRB uses Forms AA-21, Application for Lump-Sum Death Payment and Annuities Unpaid at Death; AA-21cert, Application Summary and Certification; G-131, Authorization of Payment and Release of All Claims to a Death Benefit or Accrued Annuity Payment; and G-273a, Funeral Director's Statement of Burial Charges. One response is requested of each respondent. Completion is required to obtain benefits. The RRB proposes no changes to Forms AA-21, AA-21cert and G-131. The RRB proposes the following changes to Form G-273a: <bullet> In field 3, changed 3rd sentence and added 4th sentence to "If paid by prearrangement, please show the name of the person who made the prearrangement and any beneficiary, not the insurance company or financial institution making the final payment. If there was a pre- need agreement, please attach a copy of the contract." <bullet> In the Paperwork Reduction Act and Privacy Act Notices section, propose minor change to address.
