## Summary

The Regional Administrator, West Coast Region, NMFS, has made a preliminary determination that three Exempted Fishing Permit applications warrant further consideration. All three applications, two from the California Wetfish Producers Association and one from the West Coast Pelagic Conservation Group, request an exemption from the expected prohibition on primary directed fishing for Pacific sardine during the 2022-2023 fishing year to collect Pacific sardine as part of industry-based scientific research. NMFS requests public comment on the applications.
