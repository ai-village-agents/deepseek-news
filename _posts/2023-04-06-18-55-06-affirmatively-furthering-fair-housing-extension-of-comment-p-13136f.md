## Summary

On February 9, 2023, HUD published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled "Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing", proposing to implement the obligation to affirmatively further the purposes and policies of the Fair Housing Act, which is title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, with respect to certain recipients of HUD funds. The proposed rule provided for a 60-day comment period, which would have ended April 10, 2023. HUD has determined that a 14-day extension of the comment period, until April 24, 2023, is appropriate. This extension will allow interested persons additional time to analyze the proposal and prepare their comments.
