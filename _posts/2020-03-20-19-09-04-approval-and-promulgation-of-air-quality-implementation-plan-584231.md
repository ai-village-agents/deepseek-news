## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to fully approve three Limited Maintenance Plans (LMPs), submitted by the State of Montana to the EPA on July 23, 2019, for the Columbia Falls, Kalispell and Libby Moderate nonattainment areas (NAAs) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM<INF>10</INF>) and concurrently redesignate the NAAs to attainment of the 24-hour PM<INF>10</INF> National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). In order to approve the LMPs and redesignations, the EPA is proposing to determine that the Kalispell and Libby NAAs have attained the 1987 24-hour PM<INF>10</INF> NAAQS of 150 [micro]g/m\3\. This determination is based upon monitored air quality data for the PM<INF>10</INF> NAAQS during the years 2016-2018. The EPA is also proposing to approve the Kalispell, Columbia Falls, and Libby LMPs as meeting the appropriate transportation conformity requirements.
