## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-16- 09, which applied to certain De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited Model DHC-8-400 series airplanes. AD 2019-16-09 required one-time inspections for cracks and damage of the elevator power control unit (PCU) brackets and surrounding area, horizontal stabilizer rear spar, elevator front spar, and related investigative and corrective actions if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2019-16-09, new findings have been reported as a result of maintenance activities and/or inspections. This AD continues to require certain actions in AD 2019-16-09 and requires repeating the inspections one time and performing applicable on- condition actions. This AD also removes an airplane model from the applicability and provides optional terminating action for repetitive inspections. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
