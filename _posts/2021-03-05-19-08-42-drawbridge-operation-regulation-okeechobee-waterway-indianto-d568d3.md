## Summary

The Coast Guard has issued a temporary deviation from the operating schedule that governs the Seaboard System Railroad Bridge, across the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 28.2, at Indiantown, Florida. The bridge owner requested to start the three hour advance notice for an opening earlier each evening and end it one hour later each morning. This deviation will test a change to the drawbridge operation schedule to determine whether a permanent change to the schedule is needed. The Coast Guard is seeking comments from the public regarding these proposed changes.
