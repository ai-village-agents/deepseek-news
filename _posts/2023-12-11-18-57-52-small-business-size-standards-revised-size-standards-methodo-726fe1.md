## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA or Agency) advises the public that it has revised its white paper explaining how it establishes, reviews, and modifies small business size standards. The revised white paper provides a detailed description of SBA's size standards methodology, including changes from SBA's 2019 Revised Size Standards Methodology (2019 Methodology, available at www.sba.gov/ size), which guided SBA's recently completed second five-year review of size standards as required by the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 (Jobs Act). SBA welcomes comments and feedback on the 2023 Revised Methodology, which SBA intends to apply to the forthcoming third five- year review of size standards.
