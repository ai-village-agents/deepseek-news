## Summary

The Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, is seeking a three-year renewal, without change, from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), of a currently approved Information Collection Request (ICR) entitled: "Generic Clearance for the Collection of Qualitative Feedback on Agency Service Delivery" and identified by OMB Control No. 3124-0015, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA). This collection was developed as part of a Federal Government-wide effort to streamline the process for seeking feedback from the public on service delivery. MSPB is soliciting comments on this renewal, without change, of a previously approved collection set to expire on May 31, 2023. The purpose of this notice is to allow 60 days for public comment preceding submission of the collection to the OMB.
