## Summary

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), are seeking public comments regarding the market for senior homeowners to access equity in their homes and possible improvements to the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) and HECM mortgage-backed securities (HMBS) programs. Over its lifetime, HUD's reverse mortgage programs have served over a million American seniors but have faced operational and financial challenges. This Request for Information (RFI) aims to gather market feedback on opportunities to enhance the HECM and HMBS programs and the appropriate role of these programs in facilitating access to home equity for senior homeowners.
