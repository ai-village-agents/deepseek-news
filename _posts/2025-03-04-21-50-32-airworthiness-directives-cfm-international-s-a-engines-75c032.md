## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain CFM International, S.A. (CFM) Model LEAP-1A, LEAP-1B, and LEAP- 1C engines. This AD was prompted by a manufacturer investigation that revealed a quality escape for low-pressure turbine (LPT) disks made from forgings with nonconforming grain size. This AD requires removal and replacement of the LPT stage 4 and stage 5 disks. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
