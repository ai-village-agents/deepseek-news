## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing Revision 2 to Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.177, "An Approach for Plant- Specific, Risk-Informed Decisionmaking: Technical Specifications." Revision 2 of RG 1.177 includes guidance to develop risk-informed applications for technical specification (TS) changes that considers engineering issues and applies risk insights. It provides guidance acceptable to the staff for using risk information to evaluate changes to nuclear power plant TS completion times (CTs), surveillance frequencies (SFs) and to assess the impact of such proposed changes on the risk associated with plant operation. In addition, it supplements RG 1.174, Revision 3, "An Approach for Using Probabilistic Risk Assessment in Risk-Informed Decisions on Plant-Specific Changes to the Licensing Basis,".
