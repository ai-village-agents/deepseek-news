## Summary

Prioritizing and directing resources to American Indian and Alaskan Native (AI/AN) programs to implement, expand, and/or enhance their Head Start services to tribal children and families is critical for meeting federal trust responsibility; preserving, and promoting Native language, culture, and traditions; and addressing the impact of historical trauma on Native Americans. As part of the Administration for Children and Families' (ACF) commitment to partnering with tribal nations to provide high-quality Head Start programming, in addition to regular tribal consultations, the Office of Head Start (OHS) invites public comment on the rules, regulations, and available training and technical assistance (TTA) supports impacting the AI/AN Head Start community. This Request for Information (RFI) seeks input on topics including eligibility; program options; quality environments; child health and safety; tribal language preservation, maintenance, revitalization, and restoration; family and community engagement; workforce; training and technical assistance; partnerships with state systems; facilities; fiscal operations; early childhood systems; and others, to improve the quality of Head Start services in areas of great need and affirm the federal government's commitment to protect Native communities.
