## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Robinson Helicopter Company (Robinson) Model R66 helicopters. This AD was prompted by reports of tail rotor (T/R) drive shaft forward hanger bearing failures. This AD requires installing a certain part numbered kit and removing parts from service or replacing a certain part- numbered T/R drive shaft assembly. This AD also prohibits the installation of certain parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
