## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-25-12 and AD 2022-11-11, which apply to certain De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited Model DHC-8-401 and -402 airplanes. AD 2021- 25-12 requires repetitive lubrications of the trailing arm of the nose landing gear (NLG). AD 2021-25-12 also requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program to include new and revised airworthiness limitations. AD 2022-11-11 requires a modification to the NLG shock strut assembly. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-25-12 and AD 2022-11-11, it has been determined that the pivot pin and tow fitting assembly of the NLG must be replaced. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions specified in AD 2021-25-12 and AD 2022-11-11 and would require replacement of the pivot pin and tow fitting assembly with a new, improved pivot pin and tow fitting assembly and prohibit the installation of affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
