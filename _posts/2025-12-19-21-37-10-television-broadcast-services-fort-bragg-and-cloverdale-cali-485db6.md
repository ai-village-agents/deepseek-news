## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) modifies the Table of TV Allotments (table) rules by removing channel 8 at Fort Bragg and substituting channel 8 at Cloverdale, California, in response to a Petition for Rulemaking (Petition) filed by One Ministries, Inc. (Petitioner or OMI), licensee of KQSL(TV), channel 8, Fort Bragg, California. The Petitioner further requests modification of its license to specify Cloverdale as its community of license. OMI filed comments in support of the Petition, as required by the rules. Another commenter filed comments raising issues outside the scope of this proceeding and therefore the Commission declined to consider them. The staff engineering analysis finds that the proposal is in compliance with the Commission's principal community coverage and technical requirements. The public interest would be served by reallotting channel 8 from Fort Bragg to Cloverdale in the table consistent with the technical parameters set forth in the Petition.
