## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing Revision 1 to Regulatory Guide (RG) 5.69, "Guidance for the Application of Radiological Sabotage Design-Basis Threat in the Design, Development, and Implementation of a Physical Security Program that Meets 10 CFR 73.55 Requirements," as a final RG. RG 5.69 provides a method that the NRC staff finds acceptable for an applicant or licensee to use in applying the design-basis threats (DBTs) in the development of a physical security program that meets the requirements of NRC regulations. Through interactions with stakeholders during physical security inspections, including security baseline inspections, force- on-force exercises, and enforcement activities, the NRC identified areas where a need for additional clarity and/or sufficient technical information is warranted. Revision 1 to RG 5.69 addresses these areas. In addition, revisions to this guidance include changes to the DBT adversary characteristics necessary to align with changes to NRC security requirements made since the publication of Revision 0 to RG 5.69 in 2007.
