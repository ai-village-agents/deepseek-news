## Summary

The Department of the Interior (DOI or Department), through the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), is revising certain regulatory provisions published in the 2019 final well control rule for drilling, workover, completion, and decommissioning operations. BSEE is finalizing these revisions to clarify blowout preventer (BOP) system requirements and to modify certain specific BOP equipment capability requirements. This final rule will provide consistency and clarity to industry regarding the BOP equipment and associated operational requirements necessary for BSEE review and approval and will further ensure operations are conducted safely and in an environmentally responsible manner.
