## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA or Agency), Administrative IT System Support Staff, Office of Mission Support (OMS), is giving notice that it proposes to modify a system of records, Case Records System (CRS), pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. EPA is modifying the Case Records System by renaming it to the Enterprise Legal Case Management System (ELCMS), consolidating information from other databases into the system, and moving it to a new enterprise platform, which is a platform that supports Agency-wide usage for Agency administrative legal proceedings. The purpose of the modified system is to manage the administrative adjudicatory proceedings held before the Agency through docketing, filing, case tracking, and document management and storage. Litigants, Agency attorneys and judges, and other interested parties may submit a variety of documents to the system, including pleadings, motions, briefs, exhibits, orders, hearing transcripts and initial decisions.
