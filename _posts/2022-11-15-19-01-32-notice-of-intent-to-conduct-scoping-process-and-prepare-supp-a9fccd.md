## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has received Environmental Report, Supplement 1, from Virginia Electric and Power Company (Dominion, the applicant), dated September 28, 2022, related to Dominion's application for subsequent license renewal (SLR) of Renewed Facility Operating License Nos. NPF-4 and NPF-7 for North Anna Power Station Units 1 and 2 (North Anna). The NRC staff will prepare a supplement to its draft supplemental environmental impact statement (DSEIS) for North Anna subsequent license renewal, i.e., NUREG-1437, Supplement 7, Second Renewal, "Generic Environmental Impact Statement for License Renewal of Nuclear Plants, Supplement 7, Second Renewal, Regarding Subsequent License Renewal for North Anna Power Station Units 1 and 2, Draft Report" (August 2021). The subsequent renewed operating licenses would authorize the applicant to operate North Anna for an additional 20 years beyond the period specified in each of the current renewed licenses. The current renewed operating licenses for North Anna Units 1 and 2 expire on April 1, 2038, and August 21, 2040, respectively. The NRC will conduct a limited scoping process to gather information necessary to prepare a supplement to its DSEIS to evaluate the environmental impacts of SLR of the operating licenses for North Anna. The NRC is seeking public comment on the proper scope of the site- specific environmental impact statement (EIS) supplement to be prepared for this action.
