## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-22-03, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A330-200, -200 Freighter, and -300 series airplanes. AD 2020-22-03 requires revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to incorporate procedures to be applied if an engine bleed over-temperature occurs when the associated engine bleed valve is jammed open, and provides for the optional embodiment of updated flight warning computer (FWC) software, which terminates the AFM revision. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-22-03, new maintenance actions and software related to over-temperature failure conditions were developed. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions specified in AD 2020-22-03, would require accomplishing the new maintenance tasks and corrective actions, and would mandate embodiment of the updated FWC software for certain airplanes, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is proposed for incorporation by reference. This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of affected FWC software. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
