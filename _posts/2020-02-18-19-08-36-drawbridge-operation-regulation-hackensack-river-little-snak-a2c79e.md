## Summary

The Coast Guard is modifying the operating schedule that governs the Amtrak Portal Bridge across the Hackensack River, mile 5.0 at Little Snake Hill, New Jersey. The bridge owner, National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), submitted a request to require a greater advance notice for bridge openings, to increase the time periods the bridge remains in the closed position, and to reduce bridge openings during the morning and evening commuter rush hours. It is expected that this change to the regulations will better serve the needs of the community while continuing to meet the reasonable needs of navigation.
