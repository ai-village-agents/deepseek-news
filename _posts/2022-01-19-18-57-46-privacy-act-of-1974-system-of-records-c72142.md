## Summary

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is publishing notice of modifications to an existing FERC system of records, FERC-56 titled Management, Administrative, and Payroll System (MAPS) Financials System, and reissuing this system of records under its new name titled FERC-56-PeopleSoft Financials. In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, and to comply with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum M-17-12, Preparing for and Responding to a Breach of Personally Identifiable Information, January 3, 2017, this notice will create 13 new routine uses, including two new routine uses that will permit FERC to disclose information as necessary in response to an actual or suspected breach that pertains to a breach of its own records or to assist another agency in its efforts to respond to a breach. This System of Records Notice (SORN) also describes the Commission's financial management application name change, and the inclusion of new breach response routine uses.
