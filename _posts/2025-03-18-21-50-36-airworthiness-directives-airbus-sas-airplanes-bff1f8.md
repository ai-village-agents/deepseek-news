## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and A350-1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report indicating that the thrust reverser and pylon thermal blankets were found damaged due to air leaking from the pre-cooler exchanger (PCE). This AD requires repetitively testing the PCE for air leaks and reporting the results, and, depending on findings, inspecting the thermal blankets for damage and replacing the PCE, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
