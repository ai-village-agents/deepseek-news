## Summary

In accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator's March 18, 2022, memorandum regarding "Consent Decrees and Settlement Agreements to resolve Environmental Claims Against the Agency," notice is hereby given of a proposed consent decree in Arizona Mining Reform Coalition et al. v. Guzman et al. (D. Ariz. 2023). On September 27, 2023, the Arizona Mining Reform Coalition, the Center for Biological Diversity, Earthworks, the Concerned Citizens and Retired Miners Coalition, and the Grand Canyon Chapter of the Sierra Club (collectively, "Plaintiffs") filed a complaint against EPA in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona alleging that the Agency failed to perform a mandatory duty under the Clean Water Act (CWA) to establish Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) for copper and lead impairments for Queen Creek, Arizona. This complaint followed submission of a Notice of Intent to Sue on August 9, 2022. EPA seeks public input on a proposed consent decree prior to its final decision-making with regard to potential settlement of the litigation.
