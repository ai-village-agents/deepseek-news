## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2012-07- 06, which applied to certain The Boeing Company Model 777-200, -200LR, -300, -300ER, and 777F series airplanes. AD 2012-07-06 required revising the maintenance program to update inspection requirements to detect fatigue cracking of principal structural elements (PSEs). This AD was prompted by new revisions to the airworthiness limitations of the maintenance planning document and damage tolerance rating check form document. This AD requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
