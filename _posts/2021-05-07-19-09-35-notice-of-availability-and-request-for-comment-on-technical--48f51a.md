## Summary

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), on behalf of the co-chairs of the Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases, including the Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) and the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), request comments on "Technical Support Document: Social Cost of Carbon, Methane, and Nitrous Oxide Interim Estimates under Executive Order 13990," released on February 26, 2021, available at: https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp- content/uploads/2021/02/ TechnicalSupportDocument_SocialCostofCarbonMethaneNitrousOxide.pdf. The estimates of the social cost of carbon (SC-CO<INF>2</INF>), social cost of methane (SC-CH<INF>4</INF>), and social cost of nitrous oxide (SC- N<INF>2</INF>O), collectively called the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases (SC-GHG), are used to estimate the value to society of marginal reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, or conversely, the social costs of increasing such emissions, in the policy making process.
