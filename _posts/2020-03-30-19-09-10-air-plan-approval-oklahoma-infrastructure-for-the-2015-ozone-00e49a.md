## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving elements of a State Implementation Plan (SIP) submission from the State of Oklahoma for the 2015 Ozone (O<INF>3</INF>) National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). Oklahoma's October 25, 2018, submittal addressed how the existing SIP provides for implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of the 2015 O<INF>3</INF> NAAQS (infrastructure SIP or i-SIP). The i- SIP ensures that the Oklahoma SIP is adequate to meet the state's responsibilities under the CAA for this NAAQS.
