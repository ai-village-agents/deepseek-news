## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing its approval of twelve amended certification plans for certifying applicators of Restricted Use Pesticides (RUPs) from the following certifying authorities: Arizona Department of Agriculture (AZDA), Connecticut Department of Energy & Environmental Protection (CTDEEP), Delaware Department of Agriculture (DDA), District of Columbia Department of Energy and Environment (DOEE), Hawaii Department of Agriculture (HDOA), Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce (MDAC), New Hampshire Department of Agriculture, Markets and Food (NHDAFM), New Jersey Department of Agriculture (NJDEP), Nevada Department of Agriculture (NDA), Office of the Indiana State Chemist (OISC), South Dakota Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources (SDDANR), and Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA). The amended plans are consistent with the existing regulatory requirements, including revisions made in 2017 to enhance and improve the competency of certified applicators of RUPs and persons working under their direct supervision. The 2017 regulatory revisions are intended to further reduce potential exposure of RUPs to certified applicators and those working under their direct supervision, other workers, the public, and the environment. Federal, state, territory, and tribal certifying authorities with existing certification plans were required to revise their existing plans to conform with the updated federal standards for RUP applicator certification and receive EPA approval by the established regulatory deadline.
