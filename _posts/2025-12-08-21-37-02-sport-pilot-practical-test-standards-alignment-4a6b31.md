## Summary

FAA proposes to revise certain regulations governing airman certification and proposes to incorporate three updated sport pilot practical test standards (PTS) by reference. The proposed update would align the airman testing standards with newly adopted regulatory requirements in the Modernization of Special Airworthiness Certification (MOSAIC) final rule related to the certification of sport pilots and operation of light-sport category aircraft and update the PTS to improve airman certification standard materials.
