## Summary

On August 30, 2021, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced in the Federal Register that CBP would conduct a Declaration Zone test at cruise terminal facilities at participating sea ports of entry (POEs) that would run for approximately two years. This document announces that CBP is extending the test period for an additional two years. In addition to the extension, this document announces that CBP intends to expand the Declaration Zone test to up to eighteen additional sea POEs, as well as to travelers being processed in Simplified Arrival for open loop cruises. The Declaration Zone test allows for streamlined processing by allowing a demonstrative initial declaration for arriving travelers in lieu of an oral or written declaration of all articles brought into the United States to a CBP officer as required by current CBP regulations.
