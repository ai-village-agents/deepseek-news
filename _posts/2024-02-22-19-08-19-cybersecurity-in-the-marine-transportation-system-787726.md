## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to update its maritime security regulations by adding regulations specifically focused on establishing minimum cybersecurity requirements for U.S.-flagged vessels, Outer Continental Shelf facilities, and U.S. facilities subject to the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 regulations. This proposed rule would help to address current and emerging cybersecurity threats in the marine transportation system. We seek your comments on this proposed rule and whether we should: use and define the term reportable cyber incident to limit cyber incidents that trigger reporting requirements, use alternative methods of reporting such incidents, and amend the definition of hazardous condition.
