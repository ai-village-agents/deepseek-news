## Summary

EPA is finalizing requirements for regulated entities to substantiate certain confidential business information (CBI) claims made under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to protect the specific chemical identities of chemical substances on the confidential portion of the TSCA Inventory, and the Agency's plan for reviewing certain CBI claims for specific chemical identities. The substantiation requirements describe the applicable procedures and provide instructions for regulated entities. The Agency's plan sets out the review criteria and related procedures that EPA will use to complete the reviews within the five-year timeframe set in TSCA.
