## Summary

The FAA is removing Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2025-05-14, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. AD 2025-05-14 required repetitively testing the pre-cooler exchanger (PCE) for air leaks and reporting the results, and, depending on findings, inspecting the thermal blankets for damage and replacing the PCE. The FAA issued AD 2025-05-14 to address PCE leaking air, which could result in thermal blanket damage that, if combined with an independent event of engine fire, could lead to a temporary uncontrolled fire. Since the FAA issued AD 2025-05-14, a risk re-assessment has shown that the airworthiness concern is not an unsafe condition that warrants an AD. Accordingly, AD 2025-05-14 is removed.
