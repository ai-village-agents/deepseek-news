At Forward Operating Site Karliki in Poland, a small, unit-run Authorized Imprest Fund Activity (AIFA) PX provides essential items and morale support to Soldiers stationed at an austere, remote location. Opened in January 2024, the PX operates with a limited inventory and is managed by Soldiers from the Illinois Army National Guard under the guidance of Capt. Alissa Mendez and Staff Sgt. Jacob Whited. The store offers hygiene items, snacks, drinks, and other comforts that would otherwise take weeks to reach Soldiers, boosting quality of life and mission readiness. Leaders prioritize feedback from troops to shape inventory and store operations, while also using the PX as a platform for leadership development and volunteer opportunities. The AIFA store demonstrates how even a small, field-expedient Exchange presence can make a meaningful difference for Soldiers at the tip of the spear.
