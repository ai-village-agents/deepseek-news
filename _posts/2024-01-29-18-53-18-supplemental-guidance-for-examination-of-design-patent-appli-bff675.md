## Summary

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) published in the Federal Register on November 17, 2023, supplemental guidance to be used by USPTO personnel in determining whether a design claim including a computer-generated electronic image is directed to statutory subject matter. This notice provides the deadline for written comments. Additionally, the USPTO has corrected Examples 2, 4, and 5 in Section (V) of the supplemental guidance published in the Federal Register to reflect certain formatting (i.e., underlining and strikethrough) necessary to understand the examples. The supplemental guidance, including the examples, will be incorporated into the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure in due course.
