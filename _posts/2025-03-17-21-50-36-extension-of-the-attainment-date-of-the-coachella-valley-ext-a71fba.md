## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to grant a one-year extension of the "Extreme" attainment date for the 1997 ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) to the Riverside County (Coachella Valley) ozone nonattainment area ("Coachella Valley"). This action is based on the EPA's evaluation of air quality monitoring data and the extension request submitted by the State of California. We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
