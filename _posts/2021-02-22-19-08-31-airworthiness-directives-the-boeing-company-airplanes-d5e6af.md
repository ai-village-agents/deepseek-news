## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 737 series airplanes, excluding Model 737-100, -200, -200C, -300, -400, and -500 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of cracked or completely severed lugs in the upper aft corner stop fitting assembly of the forward entry door. This AD requires an inspection, a measurement, or a records check of that assembly to determine the part number, and replacement if a certain part is found. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
