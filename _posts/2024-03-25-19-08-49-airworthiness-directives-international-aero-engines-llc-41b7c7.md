## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all International Aero Engines, LLC (IAE LLC) Model PW1122G-JM, PW1124G1-JM, PW1124G-JM, PW1127G1-JM, PW1127G1A-JM, PW1127G1B-JM, PW1127G-JM, PW1127GA-JM, PW1129G-JM, PW1130G-JM, PW1133G-JM, and PW1133GA-JM engines. This proposed AD was prompted by an in-flight shutdown (IFSD) caused by the fracture of a low-pressure compressor (LPC) 1st-stage integrally bladed rotor (IBR-1). This proposed AD would require removal and replacement of affected LPC key washers and affected LPC IBR-1 and installation of inlet guide vane (IGV) spacers. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
