## Summary

The Coast Guard has issued a temporary test deviation from the operating schedule that governs the Loop Parkway Bridge across Long Creek, mile 0.7 at Nassau, New York. This deviation will test a change to the drawbridge operation schedule to determine if the proposed operating schedule changes will meet the reasonable needs of maritime traffic and vehicular traffic. Coast Guard is seeking comments from the public about the impact to both train and vessel traffic generated by this change.
