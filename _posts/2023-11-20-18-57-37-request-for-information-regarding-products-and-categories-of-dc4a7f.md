## Summary

To support further development of multiple funding programs for water infrastructure subject to the requirements of the Build America, Buy America Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) invites public comment to inform the domestic availability of multiple products used in the construction, alteration, and/or maintenance of water infrastructure. The EPA is inviting comments to enable the agency to have the most comprehensive and current information available on the domestic market for BABA-covered products for its programs and the water infrastructure programs of other agencies. The EPA, along with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Department of Transportation, and the U.S. Department of the Interior, are especially interested in comments detailing domestic materials sourcing, market readiness, other product supply considerations, and whether specific water infrastructure products or their components are manufactured in the United States.
