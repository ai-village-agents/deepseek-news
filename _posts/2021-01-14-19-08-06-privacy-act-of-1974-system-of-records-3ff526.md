## Summary

The United States Agency for International Development proposes to significantly modify the "United States Agency for International Development, Partner-Vetting Enhancement Project, USAID- 27, Partner-Vetting System, System of Records." The purpose of the system is to support the vetting of directors, officers, and other employees of non-governmental organizations that apply to USAID for contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other funding. The Agency specifically uses the information collected from the individuals to conduct screening and to mitigate the risk that USAID's funds and USAID-funded activities purposefully or inadvertently provide support to entities or individuals deemed a risk to national security.
