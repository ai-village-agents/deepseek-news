## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA or the Agency) issues this final rule to update its regulations for the Small Business Development Centers Program (the SBDC Program or the Program). The Office of Small Business Development Centers has not comprehensively updated its regulations since 1995. This final rule updates and clarifies the regulations, making them more efficient, effective, transparent, and comprehensive, and puts them in alignment with current SBA policy and guidance. This final rule also includes policy and procedural changes identified by the Agency as necessary to preserve the integrity and legislative intent of the Program. Finally, it incorporates updates to conform with administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for Federal awards (Uniform Guidance).
