## Summary

The Task Force on Maternal Mental Health (Task Force), which is being implemented as a subcommittee of the SAMHSA Advisory Committee for Women's Services (ACWS), solicits public comments on a set of questions concerning the context, policies, effectiveness, promising practices, and limitations and gaps related to prevention and treatment of maternal mental health conditions and substance use disorders (inclusive of alcohol use/misuse) and its complications. The Task Force is required to solicit public comments, as appropriate, from stakeholders for the purposes of developing a report that analyzes and evaluates the state of maternal mental health programs at the Federal level and identifies best practices with respect to maternal mental health and substance use disorders as well as a national strategy for improving maternal mental health. The taskforce will be highlighting recommendations that fall within the pregnancy and postpartum (up to 1 year after birth) periods for individuals with or at risk for mental health and substance use conditions.
