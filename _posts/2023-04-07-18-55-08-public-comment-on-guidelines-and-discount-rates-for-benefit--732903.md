## Summary

OMB is proposing revisions to Circular A-94, which provides guidance on benefit-cost analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis of Federal spending. Circular A-94 was last revised in 1992. These proposed revisions reflect scientific and economic advances since that time. Included in the proposed revisions are changes in the discount rate for benefit-cost analysis. This guidance is separate from Circular A-4, which covers benefit-cost analysis of regulations, rather than spending. Members of the public are encouraged to provide comment.
