## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model AS350B, AS350BA, AS350B1, AS350B2, AS350B3, AS350D, EC130B4, and EC130T2 helicopters; AS355E, AS355F, AS355F1, AS355F2, AS355N, and AS355NP helicopters; and Model SA-365C1, SA-365C2, SA-365N, SA-365N1, AS-365N2, and AS 365 N3 helicopters. This AD was prompted a report of increased vibration during flight. This AD requires the application of alignment markings on, and repetitive inspections of, the main rotor (MR) pitch rod upper links and, depending on findings, the accomplishment of applicable corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
