## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled 2021 and 2023 National Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (YRBS). CDC is requesting a three-year approval to reinstate, with changes, the data collection for the national YRBS, a biennially school-based survey of high school students in the United States.
