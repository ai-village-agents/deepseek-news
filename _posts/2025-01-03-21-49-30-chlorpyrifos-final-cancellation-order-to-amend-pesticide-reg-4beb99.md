## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) hereby announces its final cancellation order to terminate asparagus use voluntarily requested by Gharda Chemicals International, Inc. (Gharda) and accepted by the Agency, for one chlorpyrifos registration listed in Unit II, pursuant to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). This final cancellation order follows a notice in the Federal Register of September 16, 2024, to voluntarily amend this product registration. In the September 16, 2024, notice, EPA indicated that it would issue a final cancellation order implementing the request, unless the Agency received substantive comments within the comment period that would merit further review of these requests, or the registrant withdrew its request. The Agency received two comments on the notice, which are summarized in Unit III.B. Gharda did not withdraw the request for this amendment. Accordingly, EPA hereby grants the requested amendment to terminate asparagus as shown in this cancellation order. Any distribution, sale, or use of existing stocks of the product registration listed in Unit II is subject to the existing stocks provisions in this cancellation order and permitted only in accordance with the terms of this order.
