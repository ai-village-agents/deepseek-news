## Summary

The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is amending the Cyber-Related Sanctions Regulations and reissuing them in their entirety to further implement an April 1, 2015 cyber-related Executive order, as amended by a December 28, 2016 cyber- related Executive order, as well as certain provisions of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. This final rule replaces the regulations that were published in abbreviated form on December 31, 2015, and includes additional interpretive guidance and definitions, general licenses, and other regulatory provisions that will provide further guidance to the public. Due to the number of regulatory sections being updated or added, OFAC is reissuing the Cyber-Related Sanctions Regulations in their entirety.
