## Summary

As contemplated by the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 (EGRPRA), the NCUA Board (Board) is voluntarily reviewing agency regulations to identify rules that are outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome on federally insured credit unions. The NCUA is not statutorily required to undertake the EGRPRA review; however, the Board has elected to participate in the decennial review process. The NCUA divided its regulations into 10 categories outlined in the included chart. Over approximately 2 years, the NCUA is publishing four Federal Register documents each requesting comment on multiple categories of regulations. This second Federal Register document requests comment on regulations in the categories of "Agency Programs," "Capital," and "Consumer Protection." The NCUA will address the remaining five categories in the next two documents.
