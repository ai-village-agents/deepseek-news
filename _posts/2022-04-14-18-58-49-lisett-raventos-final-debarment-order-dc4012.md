## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) permanently debarring Lisett Raventos from providing services in any capacity to a person that has an approved or pending drug product application. FDA bases this order on a finding that Lisett Raventos was convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct that relates to the development or approval, including the process of development or approval, of a drug product under the FD&C Act. Ms. Raventos was given notice of the proposed permanent debarment and was given an opportunity to request a hearing to show why she should not be debarred. As of December 29, 2021 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Ms. Raventos had not responded. Ms. Raventos's failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of her right to a hearing concerning this action.
