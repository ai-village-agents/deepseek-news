## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing Revision 1 to NUREG/CR-7002, "Criteria for Development of Evacuation Time Estimate Studies." This revised NUREG provides guidance to meet NRC requirements for development of evacuation time estimates (ETEs) to support emergency planning. This revision reflects the importance of various ETE model parameters based on the results of an applied research study on ETEs. The format and criteria provided in this document will support consistent application of the ETE methodology and will facilitate consistent NRC review of ETE studies.
