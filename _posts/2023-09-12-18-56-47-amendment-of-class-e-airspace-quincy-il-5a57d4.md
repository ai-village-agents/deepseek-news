## Summary

This action amends the Class E airspace at Quincy, IL. This action is the result of an airspace review caused by the decommissioning of the Quincy very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimum Operating Network (MON) Program. The name and geographic coordinates of the airport and name of the navigational aid are also being updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
