## Summary

The U.S. Copyright Office is proposing to create a new group registration option for frequently updated news websites. The rapid pace at which many web-based materials are created and updated presents a challenge for copyright registrants. This challenge is especially pronounced for frequently updated news websites. This option will enable online news publishers to register a group of updates to a news website as a collective work with a deposit composed of identifying material representing sufficient portions of the works, rather than the complete contents of the website. The Office invites comment on this proposal and the questions below.
