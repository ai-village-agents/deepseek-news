## Summary

The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC or Commission) issued a proposed rule revising its management contract regulations. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) provides that an Indian tribe may enter into a management contract for the operation of Class II or Class III gaming activity if such contract has been submitted to and approved by the NIGC Chairman. Collateral agreements to a management contract are also subject to the Chairman's approval. This final rule makes background investigations required of all persons who have 10 percent or more direct or indirect financial interest in a management contract, of all entities with 10 percent or more financial interest in a management contract, of any other person or entity with a direct or indirect financial interest in a management contract otherwise designated by the Commission, and authorizes the Chairman, either by request or unilaterally, to exercise discretion to reduce the scope of the information to be furnished and background investigation to be conducted for certain entities.
