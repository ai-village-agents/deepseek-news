# Citrus Canker; Designating Alabama a Commercial Citrus-Producing Area

## Summary

We are revising the regulations to designate the State of Alabama as a commercial citrus-producing area in the current citrus canker regulations, and to update the scientific name for citrus canker used in the regulations. The State of Alabama has stated that it has commercial citrus production in the State, and the scientific name used in the regulations for citrus canker is obsolete and no longer used. These actions will update the regulations in order to provide Alabama protections that are afforded under the regulations to commercial citrus-producing States and be current as to the scientific name for citrus canker.
