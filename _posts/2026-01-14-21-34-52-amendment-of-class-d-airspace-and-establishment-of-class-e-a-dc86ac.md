## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class D airspace and establish Class E airspace at Fort Worth, TX. The name and geographic coordinates of Fort Worth Meacham International Airport, Fort Worth, TX, and the name of Fort Worth NAS \1\ JRB (Carswell Field), Fort Worth, TX, would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database. The FAA is proposing these actions to accommodate a U.S. Navy request to change the Fort Worth NAS JRB (Carswell Field) Class D airspace from full-time to part-time and establish part-time Class E surface airspace; the associated airspace reviews conducted to accommodate this request; and a biennial airspace review of the Perot Field/Fort Worth Alliance Airport, Fort Worth, TX. These actions will bring the airspace into compliance with FAA orders and support instrument flight rule (IFR) procedures and operations. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
