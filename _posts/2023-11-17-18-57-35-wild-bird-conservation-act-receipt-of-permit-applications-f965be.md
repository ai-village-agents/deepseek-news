## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), invite the public to comment on permit applications regarding foreign bird species for which the Service has jurisdiction under the Wild Bird Conservation Act (WBCA). With some exceptions, the WBCA prohibits activities with listed species unless Federal authorization is issued that allows such activities. The WBCA also requires that we invite public comment before issuing permits for any activity it otherwise prohibits.
