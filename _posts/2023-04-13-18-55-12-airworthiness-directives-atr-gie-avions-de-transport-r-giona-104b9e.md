## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain ATR--GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42-500 and ATR72-212A airplanes. This AD was prompted by in-service experience that has shown that the lateral flight guidance of the flight director/ auto pilot may not limit HI BANK turns in severe icing conditions. This AD requires the replacement of the affected new avionics suite (NAS), as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also prohibits the installation of the affected NAS on any airplane. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
