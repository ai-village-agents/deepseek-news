## Summary

The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, conducts a preclearance consultation program to provide the general public and Federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on proposed and/or continuing collections of information in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This program helps to ensure that requested data can be provided in the desired format; reporting burden (time and financial resources) is minimized; collection instruments are clearly understood; and the impact of collection requirements on respondents can be properly assessed. Currently, the NEA is soliciting comments concerning the proposed information collection through a Participant Survey for military- connected individuals who participate in community arts programs funded by the Creative Forces[supreg]: NEA Military Healing Arts Network Community Arts Engagement Subgranting Program. A copy of the information collection request can be obtained by contacting the office listed below in the addresses section of this notice.
