## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is extending the comment period for the notice announcing a public meeting and requesting comments that appeared in the Federal Register of September 30, 2022. In that notice, FDA announced a public meeting to discuss the proposed recommendations for the reauthorization of the Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act (AGDUFA IV) for fiscal years 2024 through 2028 and that the comment period would be open until November 9, 2022. FDA is taking this action due to a delay in the posting of the AGDUFA IV Performance Goals and Procedures Letter. This extension will provide the public 30 days to comment as required.
