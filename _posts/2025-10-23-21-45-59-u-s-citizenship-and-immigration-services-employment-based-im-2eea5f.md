## Summary

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to adjust Employment-Based Immigration, Fifth Preference (EB-5) immigration benefit request fees charged by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). This rule also proposes to codify certain elements of the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022 and implement new statutory requirements. DHS intends for the rule to provide USCIS with the resources necessary to accomplish the goals of the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022 and enhance and maintain the integrity of the EB- 5 program.
