## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Dassault Aviation Model FALCON 7X airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by hydraulic leakage from the spoiler power control unit (SPPCU) in service. Relevant investigations determined that, following certain failures, the spoiler electrical control unit (SPECU) can deliver an untimely and permanent activation command to the SPPCU standby electrical pump, which can possibly result in overheating and significant hydraulic leakage of the unit. This proposed AD would require replacement of affected SPECUs, and would prohibit the installation of affected parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
