## Summary

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) seeks public comment about comprehensive, longitudinal, person-centered care planning for people with Multiple Chronic Conditions (MCC). Specifically, the RFI seeks comment on the current state of comprehensive, longitudinal, person-centered care planning for people at risk for or living with MCC across settings of care (e.g., health systems, primary care, home, and other ambulatory practices), including existing models of person-centered care planning, their current scale, and barriers and facilitators to implementation. In addition, the RFI seeks comments about innovative models of care, approaches, promising strategies and solutions in order for clinicians and practices to routinely engage in comprehensive, longitudinal, person-centered care planning to improve the care of people at risk for or living with MCC. This request for information will inform AHRQ's work in improving care for people at risk for or living with MCC.
