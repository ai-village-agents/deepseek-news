## Summary

This action changes the effective date of a final rule published in the Federal Register on March 9, 2020, removing VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airway V-61 and extending area navigation (RNAV) route T-286 in its place due to the planned decommissioning of the Robinson, KS, VOR navigation aid (NAVAID). The FAA is delaying the effective date to coincide with the slipped decommissioning date of the Robinson VOR to September 10, 2020, and the anticipated completion of pre-requisite air traffic control (ATC) training necessary to safely implement new air traffic procedures necessary to adopt the rule amendments.
