## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew information collection. Aircraft Operators seeking specific operational approval to conduct Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) operations must submit application to the FAA. Specific approval is required when aircraft operators intend to operate outside the United States (U.S.) or their aircraft are not equipped with Automatic Dependent Surveillance-- Broadcast (ADS-B) Out.
