## Summary

FMCSA proposes a pilot program allowing temporary regulatory relief from the Agency's hours-of-service (HOS) requirement that all driving by drivers of property-carrying commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) be completed within 14 hours after coming on duty. During the proposed pilot program, known as the "Split Duty Period Pilot Program," participating CMV drivers would have the option to extend their 14-hour "driving window" by taking one off-duty, sleeper berth, or on-duty/not driving period (taken at the location of a pick-up or delivery of cargo), including what is sometimes called "detention time", of no less than 30 minutes and no more than 3 hours. Participation would be limited to approximately 256 commercial driver's license (CDL) holders who meet the eligibility criteria specified for participation. Because the program would be applicable only to the rules for drivers of property-carrying CMVs, drivers of passenger- carrying CMVs would not be eligible for participation. This pilot program would examine whether such flexibility achieves a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level of safety that would be achieved through compliance with the current regulations. FMCSA believes that the exemption covered by the proposed pilot program provides the flexibility to take extra rest, avoid driving during traffic congestion, and mitigate the impacts of unreasonable "detention times," thereby improving the working conditions of America's truck drivers.
