YOKOSUKA, Japan — U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka conducted an Advanced Trauma Life Support course, reinforcing battlefield readiness and joint interoperability by training Navy, Air Force and host-nation medical personnel in standardized, life-saving trauma assessment and management. The most recent class included two Navy physicians, five Air Force physicians and one host-nation participant.

The course, supervised by the American College of Surgeons, provides an evidence-based framework for the initial care of severely injured patients. ATLS emphasizes rapid assessment and decisive early intervention, skills critical in overseas and forward-deployed medical settings.
