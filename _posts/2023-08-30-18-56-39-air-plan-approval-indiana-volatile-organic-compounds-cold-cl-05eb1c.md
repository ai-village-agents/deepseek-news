## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the volatile organic compound (VOC) rules contained in the Indiana State Implementation Plan (SIP). Indiana modified its rules to provide an additional option for compliance with the volatile organic compound (VOC) vapor pressure limit for solvents used in cold cleaning degreasing operations. In addition, rule language was updated for clarity and consistency.
