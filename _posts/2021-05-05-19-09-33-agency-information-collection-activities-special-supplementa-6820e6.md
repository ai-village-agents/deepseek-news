## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice invites the general public and other public agencies to comment on this proposed information collection. This collection is a revision of the currently approved collection for Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Infant and Toddler Feeding Practices 2 Study (ITFPS-2) [OMB Control Number 0584-0580]. The revision is to extend data collection on the original cohort of study participants by one more interview around their 9th birthday, which is four years after the end of their period of eligibility for WIC services. It also seeks to collect administrative data from WIC State agencies to examine the WIC participation patterns of participants who enrolled in the study but discontinued their participation during the first 5 years of the study (i.e., during the period of time when study children would be categorically eligible for WIC).
