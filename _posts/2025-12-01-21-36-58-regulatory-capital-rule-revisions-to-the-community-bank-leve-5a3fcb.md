## Summary

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are inviting public comment on a notice of proposed rulemaking (proposal) that would lower the community bank leverage ratio (CBLR) requirement for certain depository institutions and depository institution holding companies from 9 percent to 8 percent, consistent with the lower bound provided in section 201 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. The proposal would also extend the length of time that certain depository institutions or depository institution holding companies can remain in the CBLR framework while not meeting all of the qualifying criteria for the CBLR framework from two quarters to four quarters, subject to a limit of eight quarters in any five-year period.
