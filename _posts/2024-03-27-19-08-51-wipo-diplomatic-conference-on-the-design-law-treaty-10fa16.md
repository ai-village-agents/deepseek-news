A diplomatic conference to finalize the DLT will be conducted in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on November 11-22, 2024. Public comments are requested regarding the DLT. The negotiations at the Diplomatic Conference will be the culmination of years of discussions at the WIPO Standing Committee on the Law of Trademarks, Industrial Designs, and Geographical Indications (SCT).
