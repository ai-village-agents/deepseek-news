## Summary

The Deepwater Horizon (DWH) natural resource Trustees for the Texas Trustee Implementation Group (Texas TIG) have prepared the Draft Restoration Plan/Environmental Assessment #3: Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats (Draft RP/EA #3). The Draft RP/EA #3 proposes alternatives to help restore wetlands, coastal, and nearshore habitats impacted by the DWH oil spill. The Draft RP/EA #3 evaluates eight restoration alternatives under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), including criteria set forth in the OPA Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) regulations and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and its implementing regulations. A No Action Alternative is also evaluated pursuant to the NEPA. The total estimated cost to implement the Texas TIG's seven preferred alternatives is approximately $40 million. The Texas TIG invites the public to comment on the Draft RP/EA #3.
