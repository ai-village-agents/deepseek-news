## Summary

Pursuant to section 1014(d) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, enclosed for publication in the Federal Register is a special message from the President reflecting the proposals for rescission under section 1012 of that Act that were transmitted to the Congress for consideration on August 28, 2025. In total, these proposals would rescind $4.9 billion in budget authority. These proposed rescissions affect programs of the Department of State as well as the U.S. Agency for International Development and International Assistance Programs. If enacted, these rescissions would decrease Federal outlays in the affected accounts by the same amount. This would have a commensurate effect on the Federal budget deficit and the national economy, and would result in less borrowing from the Federal Treasury.
