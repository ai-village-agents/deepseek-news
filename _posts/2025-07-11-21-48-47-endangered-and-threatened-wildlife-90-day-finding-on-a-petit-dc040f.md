## Summary

We, NMFS, announce a 90-day finding on a petition to revise the critical habitat designation for the Southern California steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) distinct population segment (DPS) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The petition requests that we revise the designated critical habitat to remove an approximately 9-mile (15- kilometer) stream reach from the confluence of the Santa Clara River and Hopper Creek upstream to the face of Santa Felicia Dam on Piru Creek. We find that the petition presents substantial scientific information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted. We are hereby initiating a review of the currently designated critical habitat to determine whether the requested revision is warranted. To ensure a comprehensive review, we are soliciting scientific and commercial information pertaining to this action.
