## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2004-06-01, which applies to certain Dornier Model 328-100 series airplanes; and AD 2009-06-09, which applies to all Dornier Model 328- 100 series airplanes. AD 2004-06-01 requires replacement of the existing main landing gear (MLG) leg assembly with a modified assembly. AD 2009-06-09 requires modifying the MLG main body and trailing arm bushings, and revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2004-06-01 and 2009-06-09, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which will be incorporated by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
