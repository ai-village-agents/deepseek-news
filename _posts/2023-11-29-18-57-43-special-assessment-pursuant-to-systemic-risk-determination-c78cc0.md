## Summary

The FDIC is adopting a final rule to implement a special assessment to recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF or Fund) arising from the protection of uninsured depositors following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank, Santa Clara, CA, and Signature Bank, New York, NY. The FDIC will collect the $16.3 billion special assessment at a quarterly rate of 3.36 basis points, multiplied by an insured depository institution's (IDI) estimated uninsured deposits, reported for the quarter that ended December 31, 2022, adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion in estimated uninsured deposits from the IDI, or for IDIs that are part of a holding company with one or more subsidiary IDIs, at the banking organization level. The FDIC will collect the special assessment over eight quarterly assessment periods, although the collection period may change due to updates to the estimated loss pursuant to the systemic risk determination or if assessments collected change due to corrective amendments to the amount of uninsured deposits reported for the December 31, 2022, reporting period.
