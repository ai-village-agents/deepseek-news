## Summary

The Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, is revising the Ashley National Forest's Land Management Plan (Plan). The Forest Service has prepared a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for its revised Plan and a draft Record of Decision (ROD). This notice is to inform the public that the Ashley National Forest is initiating a 60-day period where individuals or entities with specific concerns about the Ashley National Forest's revised Plan and the associated FEIS may file objections for Forest Service review prior to the approval of the revised Plan. This is also an opportunity to object to the Regional Forester's list of species of conservation concern for the Ashley National Forest.
