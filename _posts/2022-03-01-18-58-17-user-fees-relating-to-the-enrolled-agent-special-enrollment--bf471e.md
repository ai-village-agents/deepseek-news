## Summary

These final regulations amend existing regulations relating to the user fees for the special enrollment examinations for enrolled agents and enrolled retirement plan agents. The final regulations increase the amount of the user fee for each part of the special enrollment examination for enrolled agents (EA SEE). The final regulations also remove the user fee for the special enrollment examination for enrolled retirement plan agents (ERPA SEE) because the IRS no longer offers the ERPA SEE or new enrollment as an enrolled retirement plan agent. The final regulations affect individuals taking the EA SEE. The Independent Offices Appropriation Act of 1952 authorizes charging user fees.
