## Summary

EPA is finalizing two technical corrections to the light-duty vehicle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions standards regulations which were first promulgated in the 2012 rulemaking that established standards for model years 2017-2025 light-duty vehicles. First, EPA is correcting regulations pertaining to how auto manufacturers calculate credits for the GHG program's optional advanced technology incentives. This final rule corrects an error to ensure that auto manufacturers receive the appropriate amount of credits for electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, fuel cell electric vehicles, and natural gas fueled vehicles. Second, this rule corrects an error in the regulations regarding how manufacturers must calculate certain types of off-cycle credits. Both of these corrections allow the program to be implemented as originally intended. The corrections are not expected to result in any additional regulatory burdens or costs.
