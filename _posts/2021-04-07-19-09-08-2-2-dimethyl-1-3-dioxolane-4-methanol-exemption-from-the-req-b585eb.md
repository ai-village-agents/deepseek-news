## Summary

This regulation establishes exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane-4-methanol (CAS Reg. No. 100-79-8) when used as an inert ingredient in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops and raw agricultural commodities after harvest and in antimicrobial formulations applied to certain food-contact surfaces. SciReg. Inc., on behalf of Solvay USA, submitted a petition to EPA under section 346a of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of 2,2-dimethyl-1,3- dioxolane-4-methanol, when used in accordance with these exemptions.
