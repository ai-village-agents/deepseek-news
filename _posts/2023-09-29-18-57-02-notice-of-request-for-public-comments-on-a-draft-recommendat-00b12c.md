## Summary

This notice seeks comments on a draft recommendation to update the HRSA-supported Women's Preventive Services Guidelines ("Guidelines") relating to Screening for Urinary Incontinence. This draft recommendation has been developed through a cooperative agreement, known as the Women's Preventive Services Initiative (WPSI), with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), through which they convene health professionals to develop draft recommendations. Under applicable law, non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance issuers must include coverage, without cost sharing, for certain preventive services, including those provided for in the HRSA-supported Guidelines. The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Treasury have previously issued regulations, which describe how group health plans and health insurance issuers apply the coverage requirements.
