## Summary

This notice announces the availability, and opportunity for public review and comment, of the revised Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS), which analyzes the potential environmental impacts of a proposal by the General Services Administration (GSA) to expand and modernize the San Luis I Land Port of Entry (LPOE) located in San Luis, Arizona along the U.S.-Mexico international border. During the draft EIS review period in April 2019, multiple comments were received, including one comment which identified a new alternative to be included in the analysis. Therefore, GSA determined that the Draft EIS would be re-released for public review that includes the new alternative. The revised DEIS describes the project purpose and need, the alternatives being considered, and the potential impacts of each alternative on the existing environment. As the lead agency for this undertaking, GSA is acting on behalf of its major tenant at the facility, the Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
