## Summary

On May 5, 2021, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) announced that it would be lifting the stay of the final rule entitled "Aluminum Import Monitoring and Analysis System", effective June 28, 2021. In this document, as well as in the final rule, Commerce stated that because the Aluminum Import Monitoring and Analysis (AIM) system was a new program, Commerce would seek additional comment from the public on potential improvements or changes to the system in a subsequent document after the AIM system was in place. Now that the AIM system is in place, Commerce is issuing this RFI to provide parties with the opportunity to provide further comments on the system.
