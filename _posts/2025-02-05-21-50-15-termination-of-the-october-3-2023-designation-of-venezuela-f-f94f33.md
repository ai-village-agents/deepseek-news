## Summary

On October 3, 2023, Venezuela was newly designated for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) based on the determination that there were extraordinary and temporary conditions in that country that prevented the safe return of Venezuelan nationals, and that permitting such Venezuelan nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is not contrary to the U.S. national interest. The 2023 designation of Venezuela for TPS is set to expire on April 2, 2025. After reviewing country conditions and considering whether permitting Venezuelan nationals covered by the 2023 designation is contrary to the national interest of the United States, in consultation with the appropriate U.S. Government agencies, the Secretary of Homeland Security has determined that Venezuela no longer continues to meet the conditions for the 2023 designation. In particular, the Secretary has determined it is contrary to the national interest to permit the covered Venezuelan nationals to remain temporarily in the United States. The Secretary therefore is terminating the 2023 TPS designation of Venezuela. This termination is effective April 7, 2025. After April 7, 2025, nationals of Venezuela (and aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in Venezuela) who have been granted TPS under the 2023 Venezuela designation will no longer have TPS. This termination determination does not apply to the 2021 designation of Venezuela for TPS, which remains in effect until September 10, 2025, or to individuals who are registered for TPS under the 2021 designation.
