## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Trent 1000 model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by reports of high levels of wear on the seal fins on a small number of certain high-pressure turbine triple seals. This AD requires manual deactivation of the modulated air system (MAS) control valves. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
