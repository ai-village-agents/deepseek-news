## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to deny the application from Northern Clearing, Inc., requesting an exemption from the hours-of- service (HOS) maximum driving time limits for drivers of property- carrying commercial motor vehicles (CMV). The company requested this exemption to support its work providing restoration, clean up, and re- construction services in areas effected by Hurricane Helene. FMCSA analyzed the application and public comments and determined that the exemption would not likely achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent such exemption.
