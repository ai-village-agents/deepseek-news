## Summary

The Department of Commerce, in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995, invites the general public and other Federal agencies to comment on proposed, and continuing information collections, which helps us assess the impact of our information collection requirements and minimize the public's reporting burden. The purpose of this notice is to allow for 60 days of public comment on the proposed data collection for the Household Pulse Survey under the High- Frequency Surveys Program, prior to the submission of the information collection request (ICR) to OMB for approval. The Household Pulse Survey was launched on April 23, 2020 with approval from the Office of Management and Budget to continue data collection through October 31, 2023 (OMB No. 0607-1013). The Department of Commerce has decided to continue the Household Pulse Survey after October 31, 2023.
