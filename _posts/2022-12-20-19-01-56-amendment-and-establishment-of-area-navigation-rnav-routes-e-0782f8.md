## Summary

This action corrects a final rule published by the FAA in the Federal Register on December 7, 2022, that, in part, amends navigation (RNAV) routes T-315, and T-325. In the amended route T-315, the final rule identified the DVANY, WP, CT, route point as a waypoint (WP) in error. In the amended T-325, the final rule identified the START, IL, route point and the DEBOW, WI, as WPs in error. This action makes editorial corrections to the DVANY, CT, START, IL, and DEBOW, WI, WPs to change them to be reflected as Fixes. This correction is necessary to match the FAA National Airspace System Resource (NASR) database information.
