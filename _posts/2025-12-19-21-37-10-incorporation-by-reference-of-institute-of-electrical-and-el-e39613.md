## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its regulations to incorporate by reference the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standard (Std) 603-2018, "IEEE Standard Criteria for Safety Systems for Nuclear Power Generating Stations." The IEEE Std 603-2018 is the most recent version of IEEE Std 603 that addresses the power, instrumentation, and control safety systems for nuclear power reactors. This amendment also incorporates editorial changes that do not change the technical information. The NRC plans to hold a public meeting to promote full understanding of the proposed rule and facilitate public comments.
