## Summary

The proposed information collection request (ICR) renewal described below will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA). The Chemical Safety Board (CSB) is soliciting public comments on this proposed collection renewal. The CSB on its own made additional changes to the survey instructions and survey questions. Additionally, the agency reviewed time considerations for completing the survey and increased the time to complete the survey. Previously, the CSB included information regarding interviews. This information collection request is only for the survey; the information regarding the interviews has been eliminated because the interviews do not fall under the PRA. The purpose of this notice is to allow for an additional 30 days of public comment.
