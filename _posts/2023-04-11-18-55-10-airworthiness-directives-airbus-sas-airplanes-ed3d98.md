## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2006-10-13, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A330-223, -321, -322, and -323 airplanes. AD 2006-10-13 requires repetitive inspections of the firewall of the lower aft pylon fairing (LAPF), and corrective actions if necessary. AD 2006-10-13 also provides an optional terminating action for the repetitive inspections. Since the FAA issued AD 2006-10-13, an updated LAPF was designed, the installation of which constitutes terminating action for the repetitive inspection required by AD 2006-10-13. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions specified in AD 2006-10-13, provide new optional terminating actions, and change the applicability to exclude certain airplanes, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
