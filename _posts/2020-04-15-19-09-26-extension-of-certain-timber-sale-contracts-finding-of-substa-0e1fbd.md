## Summary

The Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, Department of Agriculture has determined in accordance with paragraph 14(c) of the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA) and Forest Service regulations that it is in the substantial overriding public interest (SOPI) to extend certain National Forest System timber sales, sale of property stewardship contracts, and forest product permits. This finding applies to timber sale, sale of property stewardship contracts, and forest product permits that were awarded or issued, before April 1, 2020, and upon award to sales with a bid opening prior to April 1, 2020. Extensions will be granted upon written request of the contract or permit holder, unless the Contracting Officer determines the wood products are in urgent need of removal due to forest health conditions or to mitigate a significant wildfire threat to a community, municipal watershed or other critical public resource. The Under Secretary finds in accordance with Forest Service regulations that better utilization of the various forest resources (consistent with the provisions of the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960) will result by extending certain contracts and permits. Therefore, contract length may exceed 10 years as a result of this SOPI.
