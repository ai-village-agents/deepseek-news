## Summary

This document contains final regulations that provide guidance to cooperatives to which sections 1381 through 1388 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) apply (Cooperatives) and their patrons regarding the deduction provided by section 199A(a) of the Code for qualified business income (QBI), as well as guidance to specified agricultural or horticultural cooperatives (Specified Cooperatives) and their patrons regarding the deduction provided by section 199A(g) of the Code for eligible domestic production activities undertaken by Specified Cooperatives. The final regulations also provide guidance on section 199A(b)(7), the statutory rule requiring patrons of Specified Cooperatives to reduce their QBI deduction under section 199A(a). In addition, the final regulations include a definition of patronage and nonpatronage sourced items under section 1388 of the Code, and revise existing regulations under section 1382 of the Code to reference this definition. Finally, this document removes the final and temporary regulations under former section 199. These final regulations affect Cooperatives as well as patrons that are individuals, partnerships, S corporations, trusts, and estates engaged in domestic trades or businesses.
