## Summary

This final rule with comment period revises the Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) and the Medicare ambulatory surgical center (ASC) payment system for Calendar Year (CY) 2023 based on our continuing experience with these systems. We describe the changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the payment rates for Medicare services paid under the OPPS and those paid under the ASC payment system. Also, this final rule updates and refines the requirements for the Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting (OQR) Program; the ASC Quality Reporting (ASCQR) Program; and the Rural Emergency Hospital Quality Reporting (REH) Program. We also make updates to the requirements for Organ Acquisition, REHs, Prior Authorization, and Overall Hospital Quality Star Rating. We are establishing a new provider type for REHs, and we are finalizing proposals regarding payment policy, quality measures, and enrollment policy for REHs. In addition, we are finalizing the Conditions of Participation that REHs must meet in order to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This rule also finalizes changes to the Critical Access Hospitals (CAH) CoPs for the location and distance requirements, patient's rights requirements, and flexibilities for CAHs that are part of a larger health system. Finally, we are finalizing as implemented a number of provisions included in the COVID-19 interim final rules with comment period (IFCs).
