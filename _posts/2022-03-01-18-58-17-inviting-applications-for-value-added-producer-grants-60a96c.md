## Summary

This Notice announces that the Rural Business-Cooperative Service (Agency) is accepting applications for the Value-Added Producer Grant (VAPG) program. Approximately $17 million is currently available in Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 along with about $2.75 million in COVID-19 relief funds carried over from the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (the FY 2021 Appropriations Act) for a total of $19.75 million in funding. The Agency may also utilize any funding that becomes available through enactment of the FY 2022 appropriations. The Agency will publish the program funding level on the Rural Development website, https://www.rd.usda.gov/newsroom/federal-funding-opportunities. The COVID-19 relief funds allow for a reduced cost- share match of 10 percent of the grant amount (i.e., at least $1 from the applicant for every $10 in Agency grant funds) for these funds during the public health emergency. In the event the public health emergency ends, applicants would have to meet the VAPG program statutory match of 100 percent of the grant for these funds. You are not required to demonstrate how your business operations were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
