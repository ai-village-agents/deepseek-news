## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 757-200, -200CB, and -200PF series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report indicating an operator has found cracks on three Model 757-200PF airplanes at the main deck cargo door cutout forward and aft hinge attachment holes. This AD requires a maintenance record check for repairs at the forward and aft hinge areas of the main deck cargo door cutout; repetitive open-hole high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections for cracks in the unrepaired areas of the bear strap, skin, doubler, and upper sill chord at the main deck cargo door forward and aft hinge attachment holes; and applicable corrective actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
