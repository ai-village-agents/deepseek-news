## Summary

The Coast Guard announces its intent to enter into a cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) with several companies to help inform the Cutter IT Integrated Product Team on methods for improving the Cutter Tactical Commander to Boarding Team communications user experience when using CG tactical mobile IT systems. This CRADA will also investigate alternative equipment and or architectures which may provide more robust and reliable tactical mobile network connectivity to underway cutters under a variety of scenarios. The Coast Guard is currently considering partnering with IMPRESS Technologies Inc. and solicits public comment on the possible participation of other parties in the proposed CRADA, and the nature of that participation. The Coast Guard also invites other potential non- Federal participants, who have the interest and capability to bring similar contributions to this type of research, to consider submitting proposals for consideration in similar CRADAs.
