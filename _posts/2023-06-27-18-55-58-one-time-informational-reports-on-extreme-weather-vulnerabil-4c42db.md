## Summary

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is adopting a reporting requirement to direct transmission providers to file one-time informational reports describing their current or planned policies and processes for conducting extreme weather vulnerability assessments. The Commission defines an extreme weather vulnerability assessment as any analysis that identifies where and under what conditions jurisdictional transmission assets and operations are at risk from the impacts of extreme weather events, how those risks will manifest themselves, and what the consequences will be for system operations. Specifically, the Commission requires transmission providers to file a one-time informational report on whether, and if so how, they establish a scope, develop inputs, identify vulnerabilities and exposure to extreme weather hazards, and estimate the costs of impacts in their extreme weather vulnerability assessments, as well as how they use the results of those assessments to develop risk mitigation measures.
