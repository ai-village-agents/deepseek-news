## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to approve a revision to the Minnesota State Implementation Plan (SIP) which updates Minnesota's air program rules. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) submitted the request to EPA on November 14, 2018. The revision to Minnesota's air quality rules will reflect changes that have occurred to the state air program rules since August 10, 2011, and updates on actions deferred from previous SIP submittals. EPA is proposing to approve the majority of MPCA's submittal, which will result in consistent requirements of rules at both the state and Federal level.
