## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) (hereafter collectively referred to as the "Services" or "we"), rescind the final rule titled "Regulations for Listing Endangered and Threatened Species and Designating Critical Habitat" that was published on December 16, 2020, and became effective on January 15, 2021. This rescission removes the regulatory definition of "habitat" established by that rule.
