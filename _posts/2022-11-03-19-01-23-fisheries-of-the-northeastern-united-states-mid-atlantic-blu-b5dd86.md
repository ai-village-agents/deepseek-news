## Summary

This final rule implements specifications for the 2022 and 2023 blueline tilefish fishery north of the North Carolina/Virginia border and projected specifications for 2024. This action is necessary to establish allowable harvest levels and other management measures to prevent overfishing while allowing optimum yield, consistent with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act and the Tilefish Fishery Management Plan. It is also intended to inform the public of the final specifications for the 2022 fishing year (January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022) and the 2023 fishing year (January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023), and projected specifications for 2024.
