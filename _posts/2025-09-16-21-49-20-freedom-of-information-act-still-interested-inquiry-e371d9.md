## Summary

The Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) provides that agencies shall make records available to the public, subject to certain exemptions. In line with the Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Information Policy (OIP) guidance, agencies may confirm whether requesters are "still interested" in pending FOIA requests before continuing processing, particularly when circumstances have changed significantly. USAID is issuing this notice to inquire about requestors still interested in having USAID process their FOIA requests. Utilizing this procedure will help USAID increase efficiency, appropriately allocate resources, and reduce backlog relating to its FOIA processing. This notice applies to requesters who submitted FOIA requests prior to January 20, 2025.
