## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing an opportunity for public comment on the proposed collection of certain information by the Agency. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), Federal Agencies are required to publish notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of information, including each proposed extension of an existing collection of information, and to allow 60 days for public comment in response to the notice. This notice solicits comments on collection of information under FDA's current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations for positron emission tomography (PET) drug products. PET is a medical imaging modality involving the use of a unique type of radiopharmaceutical drug product.
