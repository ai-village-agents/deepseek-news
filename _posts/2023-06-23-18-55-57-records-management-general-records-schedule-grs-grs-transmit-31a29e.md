## Summary

NARA is issuing revisions to the General Records Schedule (GRS). The GRS provides mandatory disposition instructions for records common to several or all Federal agencies. Transmittal 34 includes only changes we have made to the GRS since we published Transmittal 33 in January 2023. Additional GRS schedules remain in effect that we are not issuing via this transmittal.
