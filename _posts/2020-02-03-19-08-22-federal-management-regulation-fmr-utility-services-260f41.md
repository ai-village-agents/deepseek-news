## Summary

GSA is issuing a final rule to amend the Federal Management Regulation (FMR) part regarding utility services. The rule clarifies the authority an agency must have in order to procure utility services and describes in detail agencies' responsibilities concerning the procurement of such services. To better direct agencies that operate under a utility service delegation from GSA, the rule adds a reference to the section of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) that addresses the acquisition of utility services and other procurement guidance. Additionally, the rule clarifies responsibilities for the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy for compliance.
