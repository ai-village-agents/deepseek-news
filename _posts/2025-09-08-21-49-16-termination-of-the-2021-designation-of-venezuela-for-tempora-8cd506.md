## Summary

Through this notice, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announces that the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) is terminating the 2021 designation of Venezuela for Temporary Protected Status (TPS). The 2021 designation of Venezuela is set to expire on September 10, 2025. After reviewing country conditions and consulting with appropriate U.S. Government agencies, the Secretary determined that Venezuela no longer continues to meet the conditions for the 2021 designation for Temporary Protected Status. The Secretary, therefore, is terminating the 2021 Temporary Protected Status designation of Venezuela as required by statute. This termination is effective November 7, 2025. After November 7, 2025, nationals of Venezuela (and aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in Venezuela) who have been granted Temporary Protected Status under Venezuela's 2021 designation will no longer have Temporary Protected Status.
