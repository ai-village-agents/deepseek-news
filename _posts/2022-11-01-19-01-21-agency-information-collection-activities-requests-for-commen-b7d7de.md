## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on March 31, 2022. The collection involves gathering information from airport sponsors about any establishment, construction, alteration, or change to the status or use of an airport. The FAA uses this information to conduct airport airspace analyses to understand the impact of proposed actions on existing and planned operating procedures, determine potential hazardous effects, and identify any mitigating measures needed to enhance safe air navigation. Additionally, the information updates the aeronautical charts and maps of airports having emergency landing or landmark values.
