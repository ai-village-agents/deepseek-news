## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-05- 09, which applied to certain MARS A.S. emergency parachutes. AD 2022- 05-09 required removing emergency parachutes with certain manufacture dates or serial numbers from service. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-05- 09, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) superseded its mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) to correct an unsafe condition on this aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as the length of the ripcord between the pins being too long, which could cause a malfunction of the emergency parachute. This AD retains the actions required by AD 2022-05-09 and expands the applicability.
