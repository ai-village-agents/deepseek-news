## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is proposing amendments to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) regulation for reporting and recordkeeping requirements for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). As promulgated in October 2023, the regulation requires manufacturers (including importers) of PFAS in any year between 2011-2022 to report certain data to EPA related to exposure and environmental and health effects. EPA is proposing to incorporate certain exemptions and other modifications to the scope of the reporting regulation. These exemptions would maintain important reporting on PFAS, consistent with statutory requirements, while exempting reporting on activities about which manufacturers are least likely to know or reasonably ascertain.
