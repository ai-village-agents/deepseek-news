## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for a new information collection. The collection involves questioning, via email, telephone or other means, foreign entities to determine what collaborative opportunities exist. The information to be collected is necessary to accomplish the statutory requirements to "provide technical assistance on any other aspect of aviation safety that the Administrator determines is likely to enhance international aviation safety." The information collection will also inform the FAA's International Strategy, which is the agency's mechanism for fulfilling its international role. The information collection directly supports the International Strategy by enabling the FAA to reshape and further strengthen its longstanding international contributions.
