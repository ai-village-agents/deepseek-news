## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is correcting a final rule that appeared in Federal Register on Monday, February 13, 2023, which finalized the disapproval of State Implementation Plan (SIP) submissions for 19 states and the partial approval and partial disapproval of elements of the SIP submission for two states regarding interstate transport obligations for the 2015 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). This document corrects an error in an amendatory instruction that appeared in the regulatory text portion of the final rule. This error and its correction are unrelated to the final rule.
