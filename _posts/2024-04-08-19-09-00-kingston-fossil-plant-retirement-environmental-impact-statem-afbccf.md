## Summary

Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has made a decision to adopt the Preferred Alternative identified in its Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the retirement of the Kingston Fossil Plant (KIF). The Notice of Availability (NOA) for the Kingston Retirement Final EIS was published in the Federal Register on February 23, 2024. TVA's Preferred Alternative, Alternative A, involves the retirement of KIF, decommissioning and demolition of KIF's nine coal-fired units, and the construction and operation of facilities to replace the retired generation that include a single natural gas-fired combined cycle (CC) plant, 16 dual-fuel aeroderivative combustion turbines (aero CTs) and a new switchyard (hereafter the CC/aero CT Plant), a 3 to 4 megawatt (MW) solar site, a 100 MW lithium-ion battery energy storage system (BESS), and new transmission line infrastructure. Alternative A also involves the Ridgeline Expansion Project, consisting of a new 122-mile natural gas pipeline, compressor station, and metering and regulation facilities to be constructed, owned, and operated by East Tennessee Natural Gas, LLC (ETNG). Alternative A will achieve the purpose and need to have firm, dispatchable replacement generation to meet capacity system demands, particularly peak load events, by the end of 2027 when KIF is retired. Alternative A will also facilitate the integration of additional solar and battery storage resources elsewhere on TVA's system, which is part of TVA's overall asset planning that includes the deployment and installation of up to 10,000 MW of solar by 2035.
