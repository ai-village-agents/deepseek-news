Shipyard teamwork in action to help meet the mission!  Norfolk Naval Shipyard’s (NNSY) Preservation and Habitability Department (Code 970) recently assisted the Off-Yard Carriers Team (OYCT) with attaining and installing a hazardous material trailer to improve work throughput performed at Naval Station Norfolk, and enhance quality of work life for painters and supporting trade shops.   Unlike the carriers undergoing more extensive maintenance at NNSY in Portsmouth, the carriers OYCT works on are actively serving in the Fleet supporting the Navy’s mission. 

“As CNO project teams endeavor to accomplish more work at Naval Station Norfolk, the demand for service support also increases,” said Off-Yard Carriers Team Project Superintendent Chris Comar. “In the past, the ability to nimbly provide that support has been impeded by lack of hazmat processing capacity. This new hazmat trailer provides larger capacity that allows increased volume of paint stored and greater flexibility to support the specific demands of the Off Yard Carriers Team as well as CNO projects executing work at Naval Station Norfolk.  Code 970 did a lot of legwork over a course of time to make this happen.”
