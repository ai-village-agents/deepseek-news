## Summary

The U.S. Department of Education (ED), office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) is interested in developing and instituting common standards to serve as a centralized, authoritative source of servicing and collections policies and procedures under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program. This initiative will complement the current performance-based contracts and is aimed at establishing a set of clear, concise, consistent, and enforceable federal standards for the operations and oversight of the Direct Loan Program, drawing lessons from the Common Manual model used for the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program. This effort is intended to promote consistency, transparency, and effectiveness across all post-disbursement servicing and collections functions.
