## Summary

This final rule amends the regulations of the Department of the Treasury ("Treasury"), Bureau of the Fiscal Service ("Fiscal Service"), regarding the Treasury Offset Program ("TOP") and the Cross-Servicing program. The primary reason for amending the regulation is to inform the public about how Fiscal Service will use Social Security numbers in mailings, as required by the Social Security Number Fraud Prevention Act of 2017, which requires Fiscal Service to have final regulations in place by September 15, 2022.
