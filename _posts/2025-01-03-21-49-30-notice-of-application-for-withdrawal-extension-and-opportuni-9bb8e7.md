## Summary

On behalf of the United States Department of Agriculture, the United States Forest Service (USFS) has filed an application with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) requesting that the Secretary of the Interior extend the withdrawal created by Public Land Order (PLO) No. 7664, for an additional 20-year term. PLO No. 7664, which will currently expire on Jun 11, 2026, withdrew 990 acres of National Forest System (NFS) lands located within the Tonto National Forest from location and entry under the U.S. mining laws, subject to valid existing rights, to protect the Diamond Rim Quartz Crystal Interpretative Area, located in Gila County, Arizona, from potential adverse impacts from mining. This notice provides for the public to comment and request a public meeting for the 20-year withdrawal extension application.
