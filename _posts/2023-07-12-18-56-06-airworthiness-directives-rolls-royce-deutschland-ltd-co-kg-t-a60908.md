## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-15-07, which applies to certain Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) (type certificate previously held by Rolls-Royce plc) Model RB211-524G2-19, RB211-524G2-T-19, RB211-524G3-19, RB211-524G3-T-19, RB211-524H2-19, RB211-524H2-T-19, RB211-524H-36, and RB211-524H-T-36 engines. AD 2020-15-07 requires replacement of the low-pressure turbine (LPT) stage 1 disk with part number (P/N) UL37606, UL37607, UL37608, UL37722 or UL37790, installed. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-15-07, RRD determined that additional LPT stage 1 disks are affected by the unsafe condition, and updated the Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) to add new component life limits. This proposed AD would retain the requirement to replace the LPT stage 1 disk and would include additional LPT stage 1 disks, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
