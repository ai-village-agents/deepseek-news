# Annual Reporting and Disclosure

## Summary

On February 24, 2023, the Employee Benefits Security Administration for the U.S. Department of Labor (the Department or DOL) published a final rule on annual reporting requirements under Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). This document contains two technical changes to the regulations: it changes the operational date of the final rule amendments to the regulations to address the Congressional Review Act (CRA) requirement under which a major rule cannot be effective until 60 days after publication in the Federal Register or receipt by Congress, whichever is later. The other corrects a typographical error in the lettering of a paragraph in the regulations.
