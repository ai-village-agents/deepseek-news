## Summary

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service or we) proposes to establish hunting regulations for certain migratory game birds for the 2025-26 hunting season. Through an annual rulemaking process, we prescribe outside limits (which we refer to as frameworks) within which States may select hunting seasons. This proposed rule provides the regulatory schedule, describes the proposed regulatory alternatives for the 2025-26 general duck seasons, and provides preliminary proposals that vary from the 2024-25 hunting season regulations. Migratory bird hunting seasons provide opportunities for recreation and sustenance; aid Federal, State, and Tribal governments in the management of migratory game birds; and permit harvests at levels compatible with migratory game bird population status and habitat conditions.
