## Summary

In light of recent disruptions in economic conditions caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and current strains in U.S. financial markets, the Board, OCC and FDIC (together, the agencies) are issuing an interim final rule that revises the definition of eligible retained income for all depository institutions, bank holding companies, and savings and loan holding companies subject to the agencies' capital rule (together, a banking organization or banking organizations). The revised definition of eligible retained income will make any automatic limitations on capital distributions that could apply under the agencies' capital rules more gradual.
