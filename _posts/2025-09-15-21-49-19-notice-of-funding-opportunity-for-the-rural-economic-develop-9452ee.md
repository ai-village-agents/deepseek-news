## Summary

The Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBCS or Agency), a Rural Development (RD) agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), invites applications for loans and grants under the Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Programs (REDLG or Programs) for fiscal year (FY) 2026, subject to the availability of funding. This notice is being issued prior to the passage of a FY 2026 Appropriations Act, which may or may not provide funding for this program, to allow applicants sufficient time to leverage financing, prepare and submit their applications, and give the Agency time to process applications within FY 2026. Based on FY 2025 appropriated funding and current budget situation, the Agency estimates that approximately $50,000,000 for Loans and $10,000,000 for Grants will be available for FY 2026. Successful applications will be selected by the Agency for funding and subsequently awarded to the extent that funding may ultimately be made available through appropriations. All applicants are responsible for any expenses incurred in developing their applications.
