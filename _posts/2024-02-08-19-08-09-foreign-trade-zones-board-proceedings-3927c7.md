## Summary

This action adopts minor modifications to the regulations of the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board). The primary purpose for these modifications is to provide flexibility on the method to submit application fees. The prior regulations required submitting application fees by check. The changes allow for the submission of multiple forms of electronic payments in addition to paper checks. Other revisions in this rulemaking update the regulatory language to provide clarification and to reflect current practices. The Board is also confirming it has met the information collection requirements from a 2012 final rule.
