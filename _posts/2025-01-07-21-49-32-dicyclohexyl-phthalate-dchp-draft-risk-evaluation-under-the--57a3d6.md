## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is announcing the availability of and seeking public comment on a draft risk evaluation under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for Dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP) (1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, 1,2- dicyclohexyl ester) (CASRN 84-61-7). The purpose of risk evaluations under TSCA is to determine whether a chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, without consideration of costs or other non-risk factors, including unreasonable risk to potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations identified as relevant to the risk evaluation by EPA, under the conditions of use. EPA has used the best available science to prepare this draft risk evaluation and to preliminarily determine that DCHP poses unreasonable risk to human health.
