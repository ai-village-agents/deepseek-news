## Summary

The Maritime Administration (MARAD) invites public comments on our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The proposed collection OMB 2133-0554 (Application and Reporting Elements for Participation in the Tanker Security Program) will be used to evaluate the eligibility of the applicant for participation in the Tanker Security Program (TSP). A minor change request to include a privacy act statement for the collection of personally identifiable information will be added to the form for this collection. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 requires that we publish this notice in the Federal Register to obtain comments from the public and affected agencies.
