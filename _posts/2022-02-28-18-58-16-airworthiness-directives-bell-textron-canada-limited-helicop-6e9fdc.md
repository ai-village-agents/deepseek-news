## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-06- 06, which applied to certain Bell Textron Canada Limited Model 505 helicopters. AD 2021-06-06 required repetitive fluorescent penetrant inspections (FPIs) of the pilot collective stick and grip assembly and revising the existing Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) for your helicopter. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-06-06, the pilot collective stick and grip assembly has been redesigned. This AD retains certain requirements of AD 2021-06-06, requires modifying your helicopter to include the improved pilot collective stick tube and adds a terminating action for the repetitive FPIs. This AD also prohibits installing any pilot collective stick and grip assembly unless certain requirements of this AD are met. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
