## Summary

At the request of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Secretary of the Interior proposes to withdraw 103.92 acres of public lands in Douglas County, Oregon, from location and entry under the United States mining laws, but not from leasing under the mineral and geothermal leasing laws, for a period of 20 years, subject to valid existing rights, to protect the unique recreational values as well as current and future site improvements at three public recreation sites. An additional 21.20 acres of public lands with non-Federal mineral interest and 38.50 acres of non-Federal lands, if acquired by the United States, would also be subject to the withdrawal. This notice segregates these lands for up to 2 years from location or entry under the United States mining laws, initiates a 90-day public comment period, and announces an opportunity to request a public meeting.
