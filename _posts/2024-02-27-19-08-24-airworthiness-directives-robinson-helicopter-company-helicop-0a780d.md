## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Robinson Helicopter Company Model R22, R22 Alpha, R22 Beta, R22 Mariner, R44, R44 II, and R66 helicopters. This AD was prompted by reports of helicopters losing a tail rotor blade (TRB) tip cap. This AD requires visually checking and inspecting certain part-numbered and serial-numbered TRB tip caps for evidence of corrosion and, depending on the results, removing the corrosion. This AD also requires removing all affected TRBs from service and prohibits installing them on any helicopter. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
