## Summary

The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is amending its regulations in multiple sanctions programs to add, amend, or update general licenses authorizing official business of the United States government and official business of certain international organizations and entities, and update an interpretation explaining that the property and interests in property of an entity are blocked if one or more blocked persons own, whether individually or in the aggregate, directly or indirectly, a 50 percent or greater interest in the entity. Additionally, OFAC is updating the authority citation of several CFR parts to consolidate or shorten citations to conform to Federal Register requirements.
