## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Honda Aircraft Company LLC (Honda) Model HA-420 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of in-flight smoke and fire that initiated from the windshield heat power wire braid. This AD requires incorporating temporary revisions into the airplane flight manual (AFM) and the quick reference handbook (QRH) that modify procedures for windshield heat operation until the affected windshield assemblies are replaced. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
