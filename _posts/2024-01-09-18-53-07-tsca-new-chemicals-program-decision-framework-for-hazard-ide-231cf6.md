## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the availability of a new document supporting the new chemicals program under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) titled "New Chemicals Program Decision Framework for Hazard Identification of Eye Irritation and Corrosion." The document provides a decision framework for use by the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT) New Chemicals Division (NCD) for identification of eye irritation or corrosion hazards for new chemical substances based on prioritization of reproducible, human-relevant data. The Framework supports EPA's mandate under TSCA to promote the development and implementation of alternative test methods and strategies, or New Approach Methodologies (NAMs), to reduce, refine or replace vertebrate animal testing and provide information of equivalent or better scientific quality and relevance for assessing risks of injury to health or the environment.
