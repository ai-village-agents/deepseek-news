## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a special local regulation for a recurring marine event on Lake Washington the first Satruday of May each year. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on the navigable waters during the marine event. This proposed rulemaking would restrict vessel traffic in the designated area during the event unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Sector Puget Sound or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
