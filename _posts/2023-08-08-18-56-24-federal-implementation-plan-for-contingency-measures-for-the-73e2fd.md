## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to promulgate a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) under the Clean Air Act (CAA) that consists of contingency measures for the 1997, 2006, and 2012 fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or "standards") for the San Joaquin Valley PM<INF>2.5</INF> nonattainment area. The contingency measures would apply to residential wood burning heaters and fireplaces and rural open areas. The proposed FIP, if finalized, would be implemented by the EPA, unless and until replaced through the EPA's approval of a contingency measure state implementation plan (SIP) submission.
