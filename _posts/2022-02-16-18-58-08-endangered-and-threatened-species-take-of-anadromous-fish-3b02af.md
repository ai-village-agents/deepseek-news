## Summary

We, NMFS, announce receipt of an application for a section 10(a)(1)(A) Scientific Research and Enhancement Permit (Number 25838) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et. seq.), for an associated Rescue and Rearing Management Plan for Petaluma River Steelhead population (RRMP) for the United Anglers of Casa Grande (UACG, Applicant). The proposed 10(a)(1)(A) permit and RRMP is intended to: (1) Increase ESA-listed adult Central California Coast (CCC) steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) abundance in the Petaluma River towards levels identified by NMFS in the recovery plan for this population; and (2) provide emergency incubation and rearing facilities for other hatchery programs where conditions within these facilities are expected to become unsuitable for the culture of ESA-listed steelhead or coho salmon (O. kisutch).
