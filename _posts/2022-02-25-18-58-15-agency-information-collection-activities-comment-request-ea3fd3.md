## Summary

The Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM), as a part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, invites the general public and other Federal Agencies to comment on the proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. EXIM's financial institution policy holders provide this form to U.S. exporters, who certify to the eligibility of their exports for EXIM support. The completed forms are held by the financial institution policy holders, only to be submitted to EXIM in the event of a claim filing. A requirement of EXIM's policies is that the insured financial institution policy holder obtains a completed Exporter's Certificate at the time it provides financing for an export. This form will enable EXIM to identify the specific details of the export transaction. These details are necessary for determining the eligibility of claims for approval. EXIM staff and contractors review this information to assist in determining that an export transaction, on which a claim for non-payment has been submitted, meets all of the terms and conditions of the insurance coverage.
