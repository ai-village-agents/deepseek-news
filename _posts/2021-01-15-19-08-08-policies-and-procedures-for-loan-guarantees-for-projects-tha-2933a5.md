## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Loan Programs Office (LPO) establishes amended policies and procedures for the issuance of DOE loan guarantees pursuant to the Title XVII Program and funding awards and loans pursuant to the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Program in accordance with the Executive order of September 30, 2020, entitled "Addressing the Threat to the Domestic Supply Chain from Reliance on Critical Minerals from Foreign Adversaries". The rule will establish revised policies and procedures for receiving, evaluating, and approving applications for loan guarantees, funding awards and loans from DOE. The rule will refine the definition of "Eligible Project" and address the use of Preliminary Term sheets and conditional commitments, as well as the payment of costs and fees by non-Federal third parties.
