## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for certain navigable waters of the Delaware Bay, in Lower Township, NJ. The safety zone is needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards created by a fireworks display. Entry of vessels or persons into this zone is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port (COTP), Sector Delaware Bay. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
