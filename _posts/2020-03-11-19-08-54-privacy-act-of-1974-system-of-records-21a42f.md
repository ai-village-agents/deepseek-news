## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to establish a new DHS system of records titled, "DHS/ALL-045 Statistical Immigration Data Production and Reporting System of Records." This system of records allows DHS/ Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS) to collect and maintain records on members of the public for whom federal agencies have collected information related to individuals' interactions with the immigration system. Information collected includes that pertaining to the granting of immigration requests, such as nonimmigrant admissions, grants of lawful permanent residence, changes in legal status, and naturalizations, as well as information related to the enforcement of immigration law, from across DHS and other federal immigration agencies. Additionally, DHS is issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to exempt this system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act, elsewhere in the Federal Register. This newly established system will be included in DHS's inventory of record systems.
