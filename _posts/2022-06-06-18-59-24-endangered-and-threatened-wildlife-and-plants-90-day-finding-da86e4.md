## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce a 90-day finding on three petitions to add a distinct population segment of the Plains bison (Bison bison bison) in and around Yellowstone National Park (Yellowstone bison) to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Based on our review, we find that the petitions present substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned actions may be warranted. Therefore, with the publication of this document, we announce that we plan to initiate a status review to determine whether the petitioned actions are warranted. To ensure that the status review is comprehensive, we are requesting scientific and commercial data and other information regarding the Yellowstone bison and factors that may affect its status. Based on the status review, we will issue a 12-month petition finding, which will address whether or not the petitioned action is warranted, in accordance with the Act.
