## Summary

The FAA is revising a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that applied to all General Electric Company (GE) Model CF34-10E2A1, CF34-10E6, CF34-10E6A1, CF34-10E7, and CF34-10E7-B engines with certain part-numbered high-pressure turbine (HPT) shroud/low pressure turbine (LPT) nozzle assemblies installed. This action revises the NPRM by adding Model CF34-10E5 and CF34-10E5A1 engines to the applicability. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive (AD) to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over those in the NPRM the agency is requesting comments on this SNPRM.
