## Summary

The U.S. Department of Education (Department) is issuing a notice inviting applications for fiscal year (FY) 2022 for the Disability Innovation Fund--Subminimum Wage to Competitive Integrated Employment (SWTCIE) Innovative Model Demonstration Project, Assistance Listing Number 84.421D. The Department intends to fund multiple innovative model demonstration projects to assist individuals with disabilities currently employed in, or contemplating, subminimum wage employment (i.e., SWTCIE program participants) to engage with State vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies so they may obtain competitive integrated employment (CIE). The Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) recognizes that models to obtain CIE are needed for students and youth with disabilities seeking subminimum wage employment and individuals with disabilities who are employed or contemplating employment at subminimum wage by entities holding special wage certificates (employers or entities holding 14(c) certificates) under section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) ("under section 14(c) certificates"). This notice relates to the approved information collection under OMB control number 1820-0018.
