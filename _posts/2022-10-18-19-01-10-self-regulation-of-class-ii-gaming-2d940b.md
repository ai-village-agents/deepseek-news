## Summary

The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) is amending its regulations regarding self-regulation of Class II gaming under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. The amendment revises the regulations to address an ambiguity in the petitioning process and clarifies the Office of Self-Regulation's (OSR) role once the Commission issues a certificate. Notably, the amendment: Clarifies the NIGC may issue a final decision on issuing a certificate within 30 days instead of after 30 days; removes the requirement that the director of the OSR must be a Commissioner; enumerates the OSR is the correct party to receive notifications of material changes from self-regulated tribes; expands the deadline for tribes to report material changes to the OSR from three business days to 10 business days; clarifies the OSR will be the office to make any recommendations to revoke a certificate of self- regulation before the Commission; and clarifies that, in any revocation proceeding, the OSR has the burden to show just cause for the revocation and carry that burden by a preponderance of the evidence.
