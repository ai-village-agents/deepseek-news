## Summary

The U.S. Department of Labor (Department or DOL) published the regulatory flexibility agenda of its semiannual regulatory agenda on February 9, 2024 (89 FR 9696). The listing of all of the Department's regulatory flexibility items were inadvertently omitted from that document. This Federal Register Notice corrects the February 9, 2024, document and contains the Department's regulatory flexibility agenda.
