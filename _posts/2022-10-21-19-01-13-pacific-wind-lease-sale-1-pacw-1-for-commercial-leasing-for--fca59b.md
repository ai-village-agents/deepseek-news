## Summary

This Final Sale Notice (FSN) contains information pertaining to the areas available for commercial wind energy leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) offshore California. Specifically, this FSN details certain provisions and conditions of the leases, auction details, the lease form, criteria for evaluating competing bids, award procedures, appeal procedures, and lease execution. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) will offer five leases for sale using a multiple-factor bidding auction format: Lease OCS-P 0561, Lease OCS-P 0562, Lease OCS-P 0563, Lease OCS-P 0564, and Lease OCS-P 0565 (Lease Areas). The issuance of any lease resulting from this sale would not constitute approval of project-specific plans to develop offshore wind energy. Such plans, if submitted by the Lessee, would be subject to subsequent environmental, technical, and public reviews prior to a BOEM decision on whether the proposed development should be authorized.
