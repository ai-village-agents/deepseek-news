## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2007-26-52 which applied to certain Agusta S.p.A. (now Leonardo) Model A109C, A109E, and A109K2 helicopters. AD 2007-26-52 required inspecting for swelling, deformation, bonding separation, and for a crack on each main rotor blade (MRB) with a certain part-numbered tip cap installed, and removing the MRB from service before further flight if any of these conditions exist and exceed the prescribed limits. This AD retains all inspections for certain serial-numbered MRBs, but for MRBs with a certain tip cap installed, this AD requires dye-penetrant inspections rather than visual inspections. This AD was prompted by additional reports of in-flight loss of part of a tip cap. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
