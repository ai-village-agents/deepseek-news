# Airworthiness Directives; Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (Type Certificate Previously Held by Rolls-Royce plc) Turbofan Engines

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Trent XWB-75, Trent XWB-79, Trent XWB-79B, Trent XWB-84, and Trent XWB-97 model turbofan engines. This proposed AD was prompted by the manufacturer revising the time limits manual (TLM) to incorporate repairs to the low-pressure compressor (LPC) blades and introduce a new fan blade inspection. This proposed AD would require revisions to the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the Rolls-Royce (RR) Trent XWB TLM and the operator's existing approved aircraft maintenance program (AMP). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
