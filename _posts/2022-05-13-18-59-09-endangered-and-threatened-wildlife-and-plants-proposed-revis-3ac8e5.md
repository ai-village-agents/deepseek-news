## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce the availability of the final supplemental environmental impact statement (FSEIS) on the proposed revisions to the regulations for the nonessential experimental population designation of the Mexican wolf and our draft record of decision, under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended. Our intended action is to revise the regulations established in our 2015 final rule under section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, for the nonessential experimental population of the Mexican wolf. In the FSEIS, we analyzed the environmental consequences of three alternatives, including the proposed action and no action alternative, for our proposed rule. The action would be implemented through a final rule.
