## Summary

The Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBCS or Agency), a Rural Development (RD) agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), is issuing this notice to invite applications for grants to provide technical assistance for passenger Rural Transportation (RT) systems under the Rural Business Development Grant (RBDG) program and the terms for such funding. Grant funds will provide technical assistance for RT systems including designated funds to provide technical assistance to RT systems operating within Tribal lands of Federally Recognized Native American Tribes (FRNAT) (collectively "Programs"). This notice is being issued in order to allow applicants sufficient time to leverage financing, prepare and submit their applications, and give the Agency time to process applications within fiscal year (FY) 2025. Based on FY 2024 appropriated funding, the Agency estimates that approximately $750,000 will be made available for FY 2025. Successful applications will be selected by the Agency for funding and subsequently awarded to the extent that funding may ultimately be made available through appropriations. All applicants are responsible for any expenses incurred in developing their applications.
