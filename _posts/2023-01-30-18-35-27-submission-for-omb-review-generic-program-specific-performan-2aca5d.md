## Summary

This notice describes the proposal to extend data collection under the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) Generic Program-Specific Performance Progress Report (PPR) (0970-0490). This overarching generic currently allows ACF program offices to collect performance and progress data from recipients and sub-recipients who receive funding from ACF under a discretionary grant or cooperative agreement. This generic mechanism provides the opportunity for ACF program offices to tailor requests for performance and progress data to specific funding recipients. ACF is proposing to include performance and progress data reporting for mandatory funding recipients in addition to discretionary funding recipients. ACF is also requesting an increase in burden.
