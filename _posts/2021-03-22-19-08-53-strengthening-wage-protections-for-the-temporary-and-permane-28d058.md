## Summary

On March 12, 2021, the Department of Labor (Department or DOL) published a final rule delaying the effective date of the rule entitled Strengthening Wage Protections for the Temporary and Permanent Employment of Certain Aliens in the United States (the rule or Final Rule), published in the Federal Register on January 14, 2021, from March 15, 2021 until May 14, 2021. This action proposes to further delay the effective date of the rule by eighteen months or until November 14, 2022, along with corresponding proposed delays to the rule's transition dates. This additional delay will provide a sufficient amount of time to thoroughly consider the legal and policy issues raised in the rule, and offer the public, through the issuance of a separate Request for Information, an opportunity to provide information on the sources and methods for determining prevailing wage levels covering employment opportunities that United States (U.S.) employers seek to fill with foreign workers on a permanent or temporary basis through certain employment-based immigrant visas or through H-1B, H-1B1, or E-3 nonimmigrant visas. This proposed delay will also provide agency officials with a sufficient amount of time to compute and validate prevailing wage data covering specific occupations and geographic areas, complete and thoroughly test system modifications, train staff, and conduct public outreach to ensure an effective and orderly implementation of any revisions to the prevailing wage levels.
