## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Leonardo S.p.a. Model AB412 and AB412 EP helicopters. This AD was prompted by reports of cracks in the lateral mounts of the main transmission support case. This AD requires repetitive visual inspections and fluorescent penetrant inspections (FPI) and, depending on the results, corrective action, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
