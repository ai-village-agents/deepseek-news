## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) will convene a teleconference meeting of the Advisory Committee on the Medical Uses of Isotopes (ACMUI) on March 11, 2020, to discuss the draft report of the ACMUI Regulatory Guide 8.39 Subcommittee. A phased approach is being conducted by the NRC staff to comprehensively update Regulatory Guide 8.39, "Release of Patients Administered Radioactive Material." Phase 1 of the revision provides licensees with more detailed instructions to patients before and after they have been administered radioactive material than what is currently provided in Regulatory Guide 8.39. The ACMUI subcommittee's report will include its comments and recommendations on the draft final Phase 1 revisions to Regulatory Guide 8.39. Meeting information, including a copy of the agenda and handouts, will be available at http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc- collections/acmui/meetings/2020.html. The agenda and handouts may also be obtained by contacting Ms. Kellee Jamerson using the information below.
