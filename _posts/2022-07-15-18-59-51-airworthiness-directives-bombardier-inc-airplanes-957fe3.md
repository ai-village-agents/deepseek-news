## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-1A10 and BD-700-1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports that some oxygen box assemblies had their piston ejected during the mask deployment test. This AD requires a one- time inspection of each passenger oxygen box dual manifold assembly to find and replace affected parts. This AD also prohibits installing affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
