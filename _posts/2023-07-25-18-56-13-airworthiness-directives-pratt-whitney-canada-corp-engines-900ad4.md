## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Pratt & Whitney Canada Corp. (P&WC) Model PW307D engines. This AD is prompted by a root cause analysis of an event involving an uncontained failure of a high-pressure turbine (HPT) 1st-stage disk, on an International Aero Engines AG (IAE) Model V2533-A5 engine, that resulted in high-energy debris penetrating the engine cowling and an aborted takeoff. This AD requires removing certain HPT 2nd-stage disks from service and also prohibits installation of certain HPT 2nd-stage disks on any affected engine. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
