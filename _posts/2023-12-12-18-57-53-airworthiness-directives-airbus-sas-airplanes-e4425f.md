## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. This AD was prompted by stress analysis results indicating that cracks may appear in the center wing box at frame 42 and slanted junction areas. This AD requires a one-time inspection of the center wing box at frame 42 and slanted junction areas, and applicable corrective actions, if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
