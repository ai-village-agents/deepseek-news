# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500-1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that radio altimeters cannot be relied upon to perform their intended function if they experience interference from wireless broadband operations in the 3.7-3.98 GHz frequency band (5G C-Band), and a recent determination that this interference may affect other airplane systems using radio altimeter data, including the ground spoiler deployment system. This AD requires revising the limitations section of the existing AFM to incorporate limitations prohibiting the use of a certain master minimum equipment list (MMEL) item. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
