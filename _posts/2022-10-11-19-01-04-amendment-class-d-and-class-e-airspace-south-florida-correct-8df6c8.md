## Summary

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is correcting a final rule that appeared in the Federal Register on September 8, 2021, amending airspace for several airports in the south Florida area. This action corrects the dividing line between Pompano Beach Airpark and Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport, by updating the geographic coordinates that define the line. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.
