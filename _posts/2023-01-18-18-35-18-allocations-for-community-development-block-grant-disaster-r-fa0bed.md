## Summary

In March 2022, HUD allocated nearly $3 billion in Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) funds appropriated by the Disaster Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2022 for major disasters occurring in 2020 and 2021. HUD allocated an additional $1.447 billion in CDBG-DR funds appropriated by the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2023 for major disasters occurring in 2021. This Allocation Announcement Notice identifies grant requirements for these funds, including requirements in HUD's CDBG-DR Consolidated Notice ("Consolidated Notice") found in Appendix B, and some amendments to the Consolidated Notice that apply to CDBG-DR grants for disasters occurring in 2020 and 2021. The Consolidated Notice, as amended by this Allocation Announcement Notice, includes waivers and alternative requirements, relevant regulatory requirements, the grant award process, criteria for action plan approval, and eligible disaster recovery activities.
