## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve portions of revisions to a State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the State of North Carolina through the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, Division of Air Quality (DAQ), on September 18, 2009, and July 10, 2019. These SIP revisions seek to modify the State's rules that define the categories of facilities that are exempted from Title V permitting requirements by limiting their potential emissions ("exclusionary rules") and the categories of facilities that are exempted from the State's rules that address the permitting requirements for non-Title V facilities ("permit exemption rules"). EPA is proposing to approve this revision pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act).
