# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Canada Limited Partnership (Type Certificate Previously Held by C Series Aircraft Limited Partnership (CSALP); Bombardier, Inc.) Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD- 500-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that, during a quality check in production, it was found that some of the tie rods supporting the overhead stowage compartments in the passenger cabin did not have enough thread engagement of the turnbuckle into the tie rod. This proposed AD would require an inspection for proper thread engagement of the tie rods and, if necessary, adjustment of the tie rod engagement. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
