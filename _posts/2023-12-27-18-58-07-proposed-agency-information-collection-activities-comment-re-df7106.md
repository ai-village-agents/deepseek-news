## Summary

In accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), the OCC, the Board, and the FDIC (the agencies) may not conduct or sponsor, and the respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), of which the agencies are members, has approved the agencies' publication for public comment of a proposal to revise and extend for three years the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Reports) (FFIEC 031, FFIEC 041, and FFIEC 051), which are currently approved collections of information. The FFIEC has also approved the Board's publication for public comment, on behalf of the agencies, of a proposal to revise and extend for three years the Report of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks (FFIEC 002), and the Report of Assets and Liabilities of a Non-U.S. Branch that is Managed or Controlled by a U.S. Branch or Agency of a Foreign (Non-U.S.) Bank (FFIEC 002S), which are also currently approved collections of information. The agencies are requesting comment on proposed revisions to the Call Report forms and instructions, and the FFIEC 002, as applicable, that include the revision and addition of certain new data items related to the reporting on loans to nondepository financial institutions (NDFIs) and other loans, guaranteed structured financial products, and proposed long-term debt requirements. In addition, the agencies are seeking comment on a proposal to adopt ongoing standards for electronic signatures to comply with the Call Report signature and attestation requirement. The revisions are proposed to take effect with the June 30, 2024, report date, except for those related to the proposed long-term debt requirements which would take effect for the first report date at or following the effective date of any final rule.
