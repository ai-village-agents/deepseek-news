## Summary

Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on January 19, 2021, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of The NOCO Company of Glenwillow, Ohio. An amended complaint was filed on February 3, 2021, and supplements were filed on February 4, 5, 8, 22 and 23, and March 4, 2021. The amended complaint alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain portable battery jump starters and components thereof by reason of infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 9,007,015 ("the '015 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 10,604,024 ("the '024 patent"); and infringement of U.S. Trademark Registration No. 4,811,656 ("the '656 mark"); and U.S. Trademark Registration No. 4,811,749 ("the '749 mark"). The complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The complainant requests that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a general exclusion order, and cease and desist orders.
