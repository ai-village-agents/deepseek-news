## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) amends the regulation governing use of service department records as new evidence to remove the words "Joint Services Record Research Center." This change is necessary because the U.S. Department of Army, Records Management and Declassification Agency (RMDA) has realigned its records research activities and the Joint Services Record Research Center (JSRRC) no longer exists.
