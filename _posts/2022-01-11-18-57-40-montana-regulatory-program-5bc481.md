## Summary

We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), are announcing receipt of a proposed amendment to the Montana regulatory program (hereinafter, the Montana program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). Montana proposes an addition to the Montana Code Annotated which requires changes and the addition of regulations in the Administrative Rules of Montana pertaining to ownership and control. These changes were required by an October 2, 2009, letter from OSMRE to Montana (hereinafter, 732 letter), and were necessitated by a Senate bill approved by the 2013 Montana Legislature. Montana also proposes other revisions to the Administrative Rules of Montana unrelated to ownership and control. This document gives the times and locations that the Montana program and this proposed amendment to that program are available for your inspection, the comment period during which you may submit written comments on the amendment, and the procedures that we will follow for the public hearing, if one is requested.
