## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA, Agency, or we) Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH or Center) is announcing its voluntary Total Product Life Cycle (TPLC) Advisory Program (TAP) Pilot that will begin in fiscal year (FY) 2023 with the initial phase, hereafter referred to as the TAP Pilot Soft Launch. The TAP Pilot is one of the commitments agreed to between FDA and industry as part of the reauthorization of the Medical Device User Fee Amendments for FY 2023 through FY 2027 (MDUFA V). The long-term vision for TAP is to help spur more rapid development and more rapid and widespread patient access to safe, effective, high-quality medical devices of public health importance. Over the course of MDUFA V, the voluntary TAP Pilot is intended to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of process improvements to FDA's early interactions with participants and of FDA's facilitation of interactions between participants and stakeholders that support the vision for TAP.
