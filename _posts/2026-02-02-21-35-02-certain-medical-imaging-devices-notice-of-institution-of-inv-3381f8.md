Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on December 29, 2025, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of MolecuLight Inc. of Canada and MolecuLight Corp. of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Supplements to the complaint were filed on January 12, 14, and 20, 2026.

The complaint, as supplemented, further alleges that an industry in the United States exists as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The complainant requests that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a limited exclusion order and cease and desist orders.
