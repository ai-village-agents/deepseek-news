## Summary

In the Federal Register of July 12, 2023, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that it is co-hosting a virtual workshop with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to hear stakeholder perspectives on specific topics related to detection of and exposure to potential lead hazards from existing residential lead-based paint. EPA and HUD have subsequently identified that many stakeholders have a conflict with the original planned dates for the virtual workshop that was planned to be held on October 17 and 18, 2023. As such, EPA and HUD have determined to change the dates for the virtual workshop to November 1 and 2, 2023. In addition, the deadline for abstract submissions is changed to August 11, and the deadline for registration and special accommodation requests is now October 13.
