## Summary

This notice seeks public comment on a proposed update to the Periodicity Schedule of the Bright Futures Recommendations for Pediatric Preventive Health Care ("Bright Futures Periodicity Schedule"), as part of the HRSA-supported preventive service guidelines for infants, children, and adolescents. Please see https:// mchb.hrsa.gov/maternal-child-health-topics/child-health/bright- futures.html for additional information. Specifically, the proposed update to the Bright Futures Periodicity Schedule is to extend the upper age range for the existing universal Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) screening recommendation. In the Bright Futures Periodicity Schedule, a "dot" with an "arrow" indicates a "range during which a service may be provided." In the current Bright Futures Periodicity Schedule, the age range recommended for which adolescents may be provided universal screening for HIV is between the 15-year visit and 18-year visit. The proposed update to the Bright Futures Periodicity Schedule would indicate that the recommended age range for which adolescents may be provided universal screening for HIV is between the 15-year visit and 21-year visit. The proposed update also includes an accompanying footnote to provide updated information from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) about more frequent screening for youth assessed as at high risk of HIV infection.
