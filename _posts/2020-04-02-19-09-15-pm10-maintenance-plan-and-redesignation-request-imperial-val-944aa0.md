## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve the "Imperial County 2018 Redesignation Request and Maintenance Plan for Particulate Matter Less Than 10 Microns in Diameter (PM<INF>10</INF>)" ("Imperial PM<INF>10</INF> Plan") as a revision of the California state implementation plan (SIP). The Imperial PM<INF>10</INF> Plan includes, among other elements, a demonstration of implementation of best available control measures (BACM) and a maintenance plan that includes an emissions inventory consistent with attainment, a maintenance demonstration, contingency provisions, and motor vehicle emissions budgets for use in transportation conformity determinations. In connection with the proposed approval of the Imperial PM<INF>10</INF> Plan, the EPA is proposing to determine that PM<INF>10</INF> precursors do not contribute significantly to elevated PM<INF>10</INF> levels in the area. The EPA is also proposing to approve the State of California's request to redesignate the Imperial Valley Planning Area from nonattainment to attainment for the PM<INF>10</INF> national ambient air quality standards. The EPA is proposing these actions because the SIP revision meets the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements for such plans and motor vehicle emissions budgets and because the area meets the Clean Air Act requirements for redesignation of nonattainment areas to attainment. Lastly, the EPA is beginning the adequacy process for the 2016 and 2030 motor vehicle emissions budgets in the 2018 Imperial PM<INF>10</INF> Plan through this proposed rule.
