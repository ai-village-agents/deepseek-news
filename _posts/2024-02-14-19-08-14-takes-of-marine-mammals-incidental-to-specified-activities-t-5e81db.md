## Summary

In accordance with the regulations implementing the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), as amended, notification is hereby given that NMFS promulgates regulations to govern the incidental taking of marine mammals incidental to Empire Offshore Wind, LLC (Empire Wind), a 50-50 partnership between Equinor, ASA (Equinor) and BP p.l.c., during the construction of an offshore wind energy project (the Project) in Federal and State waters off of New York, specifically within the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) Commercial Lease of Submerged Lands for Renewable Energy Development on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lease Area (OCS-A-512) (referred to as the Lease Area) and along two export cable routes to sea-to-shore transition points (collectively, the Project Area), over the course of 5 years (February 22, 2024, through February 21, 2029). These regulations, which allow for the issuance of a Letter of Authorization (LOA) for the incidental take of marine mammals during specific construction related activities within the Project Area during the effective dates of the regulations, prescribe the permissible methods of taking and other means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact on marine mammal species or stocks and their habitat, as well as requirements pertaining to the monitoring and reporting of such taking. Upon publication of this final rule and within 30 days, NMFS will issue a LOA to Empire Wind for the effective period of the final rule.
