## Summary

This notice announces the monthly actuarial rates for aged (age 65 and over) and disabled (under age 65) beneficiaries enrolled in Part B of the Medicare Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) program beginning January 1, 2026. In addition, this notice announces the monthly premium for aged and disabled beneficiaries, the deductible for 2026, and the income-related monthly adjustment amounts to be paid by beneficiaries with modified adjusted gross income above certain threshold amounts. The monthly actuarial rates for 2026 are $405.40 for aged enrollees and $548.60 for disabled enrollees. The standard monthly Part B premium rate for all enrollees for 2026 is $202.90, which is equal to 50 percent of the monthly actuarial rate for aged enrollees (or approximately 25 percent of the expected average total cost of Part B coverage for aged enrollees) plus the $0.20 repayment amount required under current law. (The 2026 premium is 9.7 percent or $17.90 higher than the 2025 standard premium rate of $185.00.) The Part B deductible for 2026 is $283.00 for all Part B beneficiaries. If a beneficiary has to pay an income-related monthly adjustment amount, that individual will have to pay a total monthly premium of about 35, 50, 65, 80, or 85 percent of the total cost of Part B coverage plus a repayment amount of $0.30, $0.40, $0.50, $0.60, or $0.70, respectively. Beginning in 2023, certain Medicare enrollees who are 36 months post kidney transplant, and therefore no longer eligible for full Medicare coverage, can elect to continue Part B coverage of immunosuppressive drugs by paying a premium. For 2026, the immunosuppressive drug premium is $121.60.
