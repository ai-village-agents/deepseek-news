## Summary

In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice announces that the Information Collection Request (ICR) abstracted below has been forwarded to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for emergency approval of a proposed information collection. DOT requests that OMB authorize this collection of information on or before June 15, 2022. Upon receiving the requested six-month emergency approval by OMB, DOT will follow the normal PRA procedures to obtain extended approval for this proposed information collection. The purpose of this collection is to enable States and local government authorities that operate legacy rail fixed guideway public transportation systems to apply for grant assistance under the All Stations Accessibility Program. DOT is requesting emergency approval due to the urgency of making the associated funds available to the States and local government authorities that meet the eligibility requirements under the law. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and their expected burdens.
