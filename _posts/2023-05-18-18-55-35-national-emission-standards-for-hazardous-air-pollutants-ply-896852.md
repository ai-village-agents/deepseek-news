## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing amendments to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Plywood and Composite Wood Products (PCWP), as required by the Clean Air Act (CAA). To ensure that all emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from sources in the source category are regulated, the EPA is proposing HAP standards for processes currently unregulated for total HAP (including acetaldehyde, acrolein, formaldehyde, methanol, phenol, propionaldehyde), non-mercury (non-Hg) HAP metals, mercury (Hg), hydrogen chloride (HCl), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), dioxin/furan (D/F), and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI). The standards the EPA is proposing include emission limitations and work practices applicable for PCWP process units and lumber kilns located at facilities that are major sources of HAP emissions. This proposal responds to the 2007 partial remand and vacatur of portions of the 2004 PCWP NESHAP in which the EPA previously concluded maximum achievable control technology was represented by no control (i.e., no emissions reduction). This proposal also responds to or requests comment on issues raised in a petition for reconsideration the EPA received regarding the technology review and other amendments to the PCWP NESHAP the EPA finalized on August 13, 2020.
