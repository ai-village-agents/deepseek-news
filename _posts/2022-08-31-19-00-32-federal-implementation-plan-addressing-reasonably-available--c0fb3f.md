The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is promulgating a Federal implementation plan (FIP) for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania or the Commonwealth). This FIP sets emission limits for nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) emitted from coal-fired electric generating units (EGUs) equipped with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) in Pennsylvania in order to meet the reasonably available control technology (RACT) requirements for the 1997 and 2008 ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). This action is being taken in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
