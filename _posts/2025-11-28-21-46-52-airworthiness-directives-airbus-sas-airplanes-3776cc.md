## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-08- 08, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2022-08-08 required repetitive special detailed inspections of certain double joggle areas on the fuselage and applicable on-condition actions. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-08-08, it was determined that additional airplane models are subject to the unsafe condition and additional requirements are necessary for airplanes repaired after accomplishment of certain airworthiness limitations item (ALI) tasks. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2022-08-08. This AD also adds airplane models to the applicability and additional requirements for certain airplanes. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
