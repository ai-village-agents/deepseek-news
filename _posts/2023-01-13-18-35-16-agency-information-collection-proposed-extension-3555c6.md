## Summary

DOE invites public comment on the proposed collection of information, FE-746R "Natural Gas Imports and Exports", as required under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. DOE is requesting a three- year extension with changes of Form FE-746R, "Natural Gas Imports and Exports". The information collection request supports DOE's Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM) in gathering critical information on the U.S. trade in natural gas, including liquefied natural gas (LNG). The data are used to monitor natural gas trade, assess the adequacy of U.S. energy resources to meet near and longer term domestic demands, and support various market and regulatory analyses done by FECM.
