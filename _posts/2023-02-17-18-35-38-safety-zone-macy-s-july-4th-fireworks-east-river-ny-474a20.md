## Summary

The Coast Guard is removing the safety zone established by the Captain of the Port Sector New York on April 11, 2001, that can be found under [Docket CGD01-00-242], titled "Safety Zone: Macy's July 4th Fireworks, East River, NY." The safety zone was established to protect persons and vessels from potential hazards associated with the annual 4th of July fireworks display and high concentration of spectator vessels. The Coast Guard has since established a Special Local Regulation that regulates marine traffic in conjunction with the annual marine event, eliminating the need for the safety zone established in 2001. This action removes the existing regulations related to the initial safety zone.
