## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), withdrawing its January 25, 2023, order debarring Mark Moffett from providing services in any capacity to a person with an approved or pending drug product application. FDA is issuing this order because the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit vacated Mr. Moffett's convictions and sentence.
