## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a Temporary Special Local Regulation for certain waters of the Clinch River. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters near Oak Ridge, TN, during a rowing regatta on March 31, 2023 through April 1, 2023. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the special local regulation zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Sector Ohio Valley or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
