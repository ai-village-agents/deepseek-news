## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Embraer S.A. Model ERJ 170 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports indicating that certain flight control electrical harnesses were routed incorrectly, providing inadequate separation from other electrical harness installations. This proposed AD would require an inspection of certain flight control electrical harnesses for incorrect routing, and modifying any incorrect electrical harness installations, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
