## Summary

FHWA is extending the comment period for a notice of proposed amendments (NPA) and request for comments, which was published on December 14, 2020 in the Federal Register. The original comment period is set to close on March 15, 2021. The extension is based on concern expressed by a number of stakeholders that, as a result of the scope and complexity of the NPA, the March 15, 2021, closing date does not provide sufficient time to review and provide comprehensive comments. The FHWA recognizes that others interested in commenting may have similar concerns and agrees that the comment period should be extended. Therefore, the closing date for comments is changed to May 14, 2021, which will provide stakeholders and others interested in commenting additional time to discuss, evaluate, and submit responses to the docket.
