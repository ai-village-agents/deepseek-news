## Summary

The National Park Service amends special regulations governing the use of motorized vessels within Ozark National Scenic Riverways. The changes will allow the use of 60/40 horsepower motors in the middle sections of the Current and Jacks Fork Rivers. The rule establishes seasonal closures in the upper sections of the rivers and limits the maximum horsepower of motorized vessels in other locations. These changes are slight modifications to restrictions on motorized vessels that have been in place since 1991.
