## Summary

The Ozark-St. Francis National Forest in Arkansas is proposing to charge new fees at multiple recreation sites listed in SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION of this notice. Funds from fees would be used for operation, maintenance, and improvements of these recreation sites. Many sites recently have been reconstructed or amenities are being added to improve services and experiences. An analysis of nearby developed recreation sites with similar amenities shows the proposed fees are reasonable and typical of similar sites in the area.
