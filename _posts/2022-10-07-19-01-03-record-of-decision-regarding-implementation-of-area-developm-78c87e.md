## Summary

The Department of the Army (Army) announces the availability of a Record of Decision (ROD) regarding the proposed implementation of an Area Development Plan (ADP) for Davison Army Airfield (DAAF). DAAF is located at U.S. Army Garrison--Fort Belvoir, Virginia. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the ROD identifies the Army's selected alternative, the basis for its selection, the environmentally preferred alternative, and the mitigation and protective measures the Army commits to implement with the selected alternative. The ROD is based on the results of the Army's Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which analyzed the potential environmental impacts associated with the proposed construction, modernization, infrastructure, and demolition projects at DAAF. The Proposed Action (i.e., ADP implementation) consists of all these projects. The Proposed Action will improve the airfield's functional layout, demolish and replace aging facilities and infrastructure, and address multiple operational safety concerns along the runway. The ADP is specific to DAAF and all projects will occur entirely within its boundaries. The Proposed Action does not involve substantial changes in missions, air operations, the number of aircraft, or the workforce population at DAAF. The Army will implement the Proposed Action over approximately 30 years to provide the facilities and infrastructure necessary to support the ongoing and future missions of DAAF tenants.
