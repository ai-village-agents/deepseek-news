## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all General Electric Company (GE) CF34-8C1, CF34-8C5, CF34-8C5A1, CF34-8C5B1, CF34-8C5A2, CF34-8C5A3, CF34-8E2, CF34-8E2A1, CF34-8E5, CF34-8E5A1, CF34-8E5A2, CF34-8E6, and CF34-8E6A1 turbofan engine models with a certain outer shell combustion liner (combustion outer liner shell) installed. This proposed AD was prompted by two in-flight engine shutdowns (IFSDs) that occurred as a result of failures of the combustion outer liner shell. This proposed AD would require a borescope inspection (BSI) or visual inspection of the combustion outer liner shell and, depending on the results of the inspection, possible replacement of the combustion outer liner shell. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
