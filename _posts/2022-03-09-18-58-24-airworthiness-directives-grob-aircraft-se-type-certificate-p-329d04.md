## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all GROB Aircraft SE (type certificate previously held by GROB Aircraft AG) (GROB) Model G 115EG airplanes. This AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) issued by the aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as in-flight detachment of a rudder actuator hinge bracket. This AD requires repairing the support structure at the attachment to the attachment bolts on certain flight control surfaces, inspecting the support structure at the attachment bolts of all flight control surfaces, and taking corrective actions if discrepancies are detected. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
