## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary moving safety zone on the waters of Tampa Bay, around a Tall Ships America Parade of sail in St Petersburg, Florida. The safety zone will extend 100 yards from the beam of the ships as they transit from the muster point in approximate position 27[deg]43.54' N 082[deg]36.38' W to the moorings at Port St Pete, St Petersburg, FL in approximate position 27[deg]45.34' N 082[deg]37.15' W. The safety Zone is necessary to protect the public, wooden sailing vessels and their crews from the hazards associated with transiting the area. Persons and vessels are prohibited from entering, transiting through, anchoring in, or remaining within the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port St. Petersburg or a designated representative.We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
