## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all BAE Systems (Operations) Limited Model BAe 146 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a finding that when the autopilot is engaged, the architecture of the autopilot system does not automatically disconnect the autopilot in response to pilot application of a pitch input or when the electric pitch trim switch on either pilot control wheel is operated. This AD requires modifying the autopilot engagement circuit. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
