## Summary

The Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) is adopting the changes we proposed in an August 2021 notice of proposed rulemaking for our regulation governing the use of the Automated Clearing House (ACH) Network. Consistent with past practice, our regulation adopts, with some exceptions, the Nacha Operating Rules & Operating Guidelines (Operating Rules & Guidelines) developed and published by Nacha as the rules governing the use of the ACH Network by Federal agencies. We are issuing this final rule to address changes that Nacha has made since its publication of the 2019 Operating Rules & Guidelines. These changes include amendments set forth in the 2020 and 2021 Operating Rules & Guidelines, including supplement #1-2021.
