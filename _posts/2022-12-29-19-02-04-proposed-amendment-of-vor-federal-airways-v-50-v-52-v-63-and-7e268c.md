## Summary

This action proposes to amend VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-50, V-52, V-63, and V-586, and revoke VOR Federal airway V-582. The FAA is proposing this action due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Quincy, IL (UIN), VOR/ Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) navigational aid (NAVAID). The Quincy VOR is being decommissioned in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
