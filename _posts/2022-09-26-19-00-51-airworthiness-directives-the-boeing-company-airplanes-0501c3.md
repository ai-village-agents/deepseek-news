## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, and -900 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by an evaluation by the design approval holder (DAH) indicating that certain web lap splices in the center dome apex of the aft pressure bulkhead are subject to widespread fatigue damage (WFD). This AD requires a general visual inspection for existing repairs at the aft pressure bulkhead; repetitive detailed, high frequency eddy current (HFEC), and low frequency eddy current (LFEC) inspections; and repair if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
