## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are removing Nelson's checker-mallow (Sidalcea nelsoniana) from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Plants. Our review of the best available scientific and commercial data indicates that the threats to Nelson's checker-mallow have been eliminated or reduced to the point that the species no longer meets the definition of an endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act).
