## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission or FCC) seeks comment on several proposed updates to broadcast radio and TV rules to better reflect current application processing requirements, clarify ambiguity, and remove references to outdated procedures and legacy filing systems. Such action ensures that the Commission's rules are accurate, reducing potential confusion among the public, applicants, licensees, and practitioners, and alleviating unnecessary burdens.
