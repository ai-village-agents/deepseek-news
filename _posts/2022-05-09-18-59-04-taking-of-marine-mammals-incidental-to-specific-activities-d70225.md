## Summary

NMFS has received a request from the City of Hoonah (City) for the re-issuance of a previously issued incidental harassment authorization (IHA) with the only change being effective dates. The initial IHA authorized take of nine species of marine mammals, by Level A and Level B harassment, incidental to pile driving activities associated with construction upgrades of a cargo dock at the city-owned Hoonah Marine Industrial Center (HMIC) in Port Frederick Inlet on Chichagof Island in Hoonah, Alaska. The project has been delayed and none of the work covered in the initial IHA has been conducted. The initial IHA was effective from May 7, 2021, through May 6, 2022. The City has requested re-issuance with new effective dates of October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023. The scope of the activities and anticipated effects remain the same, authorized take numbers are not changed, and the required mitigation, monitoring, and reporting remains the same as included in the initial IHA. NMFS is, therefore, issuing a second identical IHA to cover the incidental take analyzed and authorized in the initial IHA.
