## Summary

In this rule, the Drug Enforcement Administration places 10 specified fentanyl-related substances permanently in schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. These 10 specific substances all fall within the definition of fentanyl-related substances set forth in a February 6, 2018, temporary scheduling order. Through the Temporary Reauthorization and Study of the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act, which became law on February 6, 2020, Congress extended the temporary control of fentanyl-related substances until May 6, 2021. The regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions applicable to schedule I controlled substances on persons who handle (manufacture, distribute, reverse distribute, import, export, engage in research, conduct instructional activities or chemical analysis, or possess), or propose to handle any of these 10 specified fentanyl-related substances will continue to be applicable permanently as a result of this action.
