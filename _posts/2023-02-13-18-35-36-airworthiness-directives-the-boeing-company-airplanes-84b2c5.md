## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2007-10- 04, which applied to all McDonnell Douglas Model DC-9-81 (MD-81), DC-9- 82 (MD-82), DC-9-83 (MD-83), DC-9-87 (MD-87), and MD-88 airplanes. AD 2007-10-04 required repetitive inspections to detect cracks in the horizontal stabilizer, and related investigative and corrective actions if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2007-10-04, it has been determined that certain compliance times and repetitive intervals must be reduced to address the unsafe condition. This AD continues to require the actions specified in AD 2007-10-04 with revised compliance times for certain actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
