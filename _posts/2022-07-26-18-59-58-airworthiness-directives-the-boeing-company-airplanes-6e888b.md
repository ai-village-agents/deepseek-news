## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 777 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by fuel system reviews conducted by the manufacturer. This proposed AD would require, depending on the airplane configuration, installation of Teflon sleeves, cap sealing of fasteners, detailed inspections, and corrective actions. This proposed AD would also require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate more restrictive airworthiness limitations (AWLs). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
