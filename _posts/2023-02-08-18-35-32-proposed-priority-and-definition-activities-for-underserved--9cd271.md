## Summary

The U.S. Department of Education (Department) proposes a priority and definition under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (Rehabilitation Act), for Activities for Underserved Populations, Assistance Listing Number (ALN) 84.315C. The purpose of this priority is to make awards to minority entities and Indian Tribes to conduct research, training and technical assistance, and related activities to improve services under the Rehabilitation Act, especially services provided to underserved populations. For this priority, as discussed further in SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION, we propose to define "underserved populations" to mean "Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and other persons of color." The Department may use the proposed priority and definition for competitions in fiscal year (FY) 2023 and later years.
