## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-2B16 (604 Variant) airplanes. This AD was prompted by sleeve loops on some passenger oxygen mask lanyards that had improper crimping and unsealed ends. This AD requires an inspection of the passenger oxygen mask lanyards and replacement of defective oxygen mask lanyards. This AD also prohibits the installation of affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
