## Summary

NMFS is implementing a temporary emergency rule to prohibit trap/pot fishery buoy lines between Federal and State waters within the Massachusetts Restricted Area during the month of April 2022 to reduce the incidental mortality and serious injury to North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) in commercial lobster and Jonah crab trap/ pot fisheries. This emergency rule is necessary to reduce the risk of right whale mortality and serious injury in buoy lines in an area with a high co-occurrence of whales and buoy lines.
