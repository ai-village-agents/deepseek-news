## Summary

On March 25, 2021, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE or the Department) published in the Federal Register an early assessment request for information (RFI) pertaining to the potential amendment of energy conservation standards for consumer boilers. The early assessment RFI provided an opportunity for submission of written comments, data, and information to the Department by April 26, 2021. Prior to the end of the comment period for the RFI, DOE received requests from the Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI), as well as from the American Public Gas Association (APGA), seeking additional time to consider the issues raised in the early assessment RFI. In light of these requests, DOE is announcing its decision to extend the comment period on the subject RFI for an additional 30 days.
