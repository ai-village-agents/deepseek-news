## Summary

DOT invites public comments about its intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection used by DOT's Equal Employment Opportunity Complaints and Investigations Division within the Departmental Office of Civil Rights. This collection is a form titled "Individual Complaint of Employment Discrimination" (Complaint Form). The Complaint Form is necessary for employees, former employees, and/or applicants for employment to file formal equal employment opportunity (EEO) discrimination complaints against DOT and, in turn, for DOT to process the complaints. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 requires DOT to publish this 60-day notice in the Federal Register.
