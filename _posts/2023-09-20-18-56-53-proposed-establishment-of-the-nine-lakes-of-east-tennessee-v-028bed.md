## Summary

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes establishing the approximately 4,064-square mile "Nine Lakes of East Tennessee" viticultural area in northeastern Tennessee. The proposed viticultural area is not within any other established viticultural area. TTB designates viticultural areas to allow vintners to better describe the origin of their wines and to allow consumers to better identify wines they may purchase. TTB invites comments on this proposed addition to its regulations.
