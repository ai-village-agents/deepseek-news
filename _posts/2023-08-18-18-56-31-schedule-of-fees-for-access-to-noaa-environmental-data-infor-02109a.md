## Summary

In this final rule, NESDIS establishes a new schedule of fees for special access to NOAA data, information, and related products and services. NOAA continues to make its environmental data available to the public without any fee in most instances, primarily via NOAA's Comprehensive Large Array-Data Stewardship System (CLASS). NESDIS is revising the fee schedule that has been in effect since 2021 to ensure that the fees accurately reflect the costs of providing access to the environmental data, information, and related products and services.
