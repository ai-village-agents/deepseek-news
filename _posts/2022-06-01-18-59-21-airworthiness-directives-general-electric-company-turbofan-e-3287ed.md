# Airworthiness Directives; General Electric Company Turbofan Engines

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain General Electric Company (GE) GEnx-1B and GEnx-2B model turbofan engines. This proposed AD was prompted by the detection of melt-related freckles in the forgings and billets, which may reduce the life of certain compressor discharge pressure (CDP) seals, interstage seals, high-pressure turbine (HPT) rotor stage 2 disks, and stages 6-10 compressor rotor spools. This proposed AD would require revising the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the applicable GEnx-1B and GEnx-2B Engine Manual (EM) and the operator's existing approved maintenance program or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate reduced life limits for these parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
