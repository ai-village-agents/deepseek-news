## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing for public comment a draft regulatory guide (DG), DG-1304, "Safety-Related Steel Structures and Steel-Plate Composite Walls for other than Reactor Vessels and Containments." DG-1304 is a new guide that proposes guidance to meet regulatory requirements for safety-related steel structures and steel-plate composite walls for other than reactor vessels. DG-1304 endorses, with exceptions and clarifications, the 2018 edition of American National Standards Institute/American Nuclear Society (ANSI/AISC) N690, "Specification for Safety-Related Steel Structures for Nuclear Facilities."
