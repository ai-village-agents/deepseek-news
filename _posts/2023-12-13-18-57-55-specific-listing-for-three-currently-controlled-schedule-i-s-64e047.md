## Summary

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is establishing a specific listing and DEA Controlled Substances Code Number (drug code) for three substances: N-(1-amino-3,3-dimethyl-1-oxobutan-2-yl)-1-butyl- 1H-indazole-3-carboxamide (also known as ADB-BUTINACA); 4-methyl-1- phenyl-2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)pentan-1-one (also known as [alpha]-PiHP or alpha-PiHP); and 2-(methylamino)-1-(3-methylphenyl)propan-1-one (also known as 3-MMC or 3-methylmethcathinone) in schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Although ADB-BUTINACA, [alpha]-PiHP, and 3-MMC are not specifically listed in schedule I of the CSA with their own unique drug codes, they are schedule I controlled substances in the United States because they are positional isomers of AB-PINACA (controlled January 30, 2015), [alpha]-PHP (controlled July 18, 2019), and mephedrone (controlled as a hallucinogen July 9, 2012), respectively, each of which are schedule I hallucinogens. Therefore, DEA is simply amending the schedule I hallucinogenic substances list in its regulations to separately include ADB-BUTINACA, [alpha]-PiHP, and 3-MMC.
