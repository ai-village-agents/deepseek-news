## Summary

On August 19, 2022, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a proposed rule determining that the Anne Arundel County and Baltimore County, Maryland sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) nonattainment area attained the 2010 primary SO<INF>2</INF> national ambient air quality standard (2010 SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS) under EPA's Clean Data Policy using a clean data determination (CDD). EPA simultaneously proposed to approve certain elements of the attainment plan contained in Maryland's state implementation plan (SIP) revision for the Anne Arundel County and Baltimore County SO<INF>2</INF> nonattainment area, submitted to EPA on January 31, 2020. Additionally, EPA proposed to approve as SIP strengthening measures certain emission limit requirements on large SO<INF>2</INF> emission sources that were submitted as part of Maryland's attainment plan for the nonattainment area. EPA inadvertently failed to upload the supporting and related materials in the docket simultaneously with the publication of the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on August 19, 2022 (87 FR 51006). The supporting and related materials were added to the docket on August 29, 2022. To ensure that the public has adequate time and information to submit comments, EPA is extending the comment period for ten days to September 29, 2022. This action is being taken under the Clean Air Act (CAA).
