## Summary

MSHA is proposing to allow the use of non-permissible Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPRs) in specified underground areas of mines, if the equipment meets certain technical specifications and is operated under specific conditions. This proposed rule would codify technical specifications and working conditions to allow the use of non-permissible PAPRs in underground gassy mines. This proposed rule would reduce burden because mine operators would no longer need to submit a petition for modification to use non-permissible PAPRs.
