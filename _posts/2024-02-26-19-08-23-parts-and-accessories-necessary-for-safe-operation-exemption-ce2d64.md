## Summary

In a notice of provisional renewal of exemption published in the Federal Register on February 21, 2024, FMCSA announced its decision to provisionally renew an exemption requested jointly by the Automobile Carriers Conference of the American Trucking Associations and the Auto Haulers Association of America to relieve motor carriers operating stinger-steered automobile transporter equipment from the requirement to place warning flags on projecting loads of new and used motor vehicles. The provisional exemption renewal contained an error in the Summary section regarding the term of the provisional exemption. The Agency corrects this error.
