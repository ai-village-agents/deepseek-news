## Summary

This final rule removes an unnecessary and outdated Department of Defense (DoD) rule relating to a health promotion program. The majority of the content of this part includes internal DoD policy, which does not require rulemaking. Additionally, since this rule was codified, the General Services Administration (GSA) issued a rule that superseded the public-facing content of this part. Therefore, this part can be removed from the CFR.
