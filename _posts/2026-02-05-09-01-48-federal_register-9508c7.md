NMFS implements an accountability measure (AM) for commercial greater amberjack in the Gulf of America (Gulf) exclusive economic zone (EEZ) for the 2026 fishing year through this temporary rule. NMFS has determined that Gulf greater amberjack landings in 2025 exceeded the commercial annual catch limit (ACL). Therefore, NMFS reduces both the commercial ACL and commercial annual catch target (ACT) for Gulf greater amberjack during the 2026 fishing year. This commercial ACL and ACT reduction is necessary to protect the Gulf greater amberjack resource.
