## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is denying a petition for rulemaking dated May 31, 2020, submitted by Brian Magnuson. The petitioner requested that the NRC revise its regulations to codify the source term methodologies and corresponding release fractions recommended in a report issued by Sandia National Laboratories; to codify a modified version of draft regulatory guide DG-1199, including the source term methodologies recommended in the report and the corresponding release fractions; and to account for high burnup fuel pellet fragmentation, relocation, and dispersal outside of the fuel rod during postulated design basis accidents. The NRC docketed the petition on June 18, 2020, and assigned it Docket No. PRM-50-122. The NRC is denying the petition because the proposed changes would unnecessarily reduce the intended flexibility in the NRC's regulatory approach, and they are not necessary to provide reasonable assurance of adequate protection of public health and safety.
