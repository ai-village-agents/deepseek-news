## Summary

In accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, Treasury is issuing a final rule, exempting a new system of records, entitled "FinCEN .004--Beneficial Ownership Information System," from certain provisions of the Privacy Act. The Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) System is being established to implement the beneficial ownership information reporting and access requirements set out in the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA), which was enacted on January 1, 2021, as part of the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020. The exemptions are intended to increase the value of the system for law enforcement purposes and to comply with the CTA's prohibitions against unauthorized disclosure of certain information.
