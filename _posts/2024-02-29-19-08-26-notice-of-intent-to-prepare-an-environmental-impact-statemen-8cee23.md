## Summary

The FHWA in coordination with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation Highway Division (MassDOT) is issuing this Notice of Intent (NOI) to solicit comments and advise the public, agencies, and stakeholders that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) will be prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to study the potential environmental and related social and economic effects of proposed transportation improvements through the Cape Cod Bridges Program in the town of Bourne, Barnstable County, Massachusetts. The Cape Cod Bridges Program proposes critical transportation infrastructure improvements including replacement of the Bourne and Sagamore highway bridges spanning Cape Cod Canal; reconfiguration of the highway approach networks north and south of Cape Cod Canal to align with the replacement highway bridges; and provision of separated pedestrian and bicycle accommodations along the replacement bridges with connections to the local roadway network. This NOI contains a summary of the information required in the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) NEPA regulations. This NOI should be reviewed together with the Supplementary NOI Document, which includes important details about the Cape Cod Bridges Program and complements the information in this NOI. Persons and agencies who may be interested in or affected by the Cape Cod Bridges Program are encouraged to comment on the information in this NOI and the Supplementary NOI Document. All comments received in response to this NOI will be considered and any information presented herein may be revised in consideration of the comments.
