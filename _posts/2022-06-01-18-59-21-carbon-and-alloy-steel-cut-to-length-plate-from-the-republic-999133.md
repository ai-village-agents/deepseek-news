## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on carbon and alloy steel cut-to-length plate from the Republic of Korea. The period of review (POR) is May 1, 2020, through April 30, 2021. The review covers one producer/exporter of the subject merchandise, POSCO, POSCO International Corporation and its affiliated companies (collectively, the POSCO single entity). We preliminarily determine that sales of subject merchandise by the POSCO single entity were made at prices below normal value (NV). Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.
