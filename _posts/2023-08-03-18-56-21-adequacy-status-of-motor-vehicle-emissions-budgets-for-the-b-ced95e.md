## Summary

In this notice, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is notifying the public that it has found that the 2023 motor vehicle emissions budgets (MVEBs) for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>), submitted by the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) on March 7, 2023, for the 2015 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS), are adequate for transportation conformity purposes for the Baltimore 2015 8-hour ozone moderate nonattainment area.
