## Summary

This action amends the Class E airspace at Hutchinson, MN. This action is the result of an airspace review conducted due to the decommissioning of the Darwin very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimum Operating Network (MON) Program. The name of the airport is also being updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database. This action brings the airspace into compliance with FAA orders to support instrument flight rule (IFR) operations.
