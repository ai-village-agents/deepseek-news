## Summary

In a final rule published in the Federal Register on January 21, 2022, FMCSA amended its regulations to permit individuals who do not satisfy, with the worse eye, either the existing distant visual acuity standard with corrective lenses or the field of vision standard, or both, to be physically qualified to operate a commercial motor vehicle in interstate commerce under specified conditions. The document included an incorrect date for grandfathered drivers who participated in a vision waiver study program to come into compliance with the provisions in the final rule.
