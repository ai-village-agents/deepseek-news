## Summary

We, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), have received an application from the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission (applicant, NCWRC) for an enhancement of survival permit for take of aquatic species in North Carolina. The applicant also submitted a combined proposed programmatic safe harbor agreement (SHA) and candidate conservation agreement with assurances (CCAA) in support of the application. The Service has prepared an environmental action statement and low-effect screening form, both of which are also available for public review. We invite the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies to comment on these documents.
