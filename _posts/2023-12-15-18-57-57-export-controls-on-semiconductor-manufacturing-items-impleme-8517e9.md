## Summary

On October 25, 2023, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) published in the Federal Register the interim final rules (IFR), "Export Controls on Semiconductor Manufacturing Items" (SME IFR) and "Implementation of Additional Export Controls: Certain Advanced Computing Items; Supercomputer and Semiconductor End Use; Updates and Corrections" (AC/S IFR). This notification extends the deadline for submission of written comments on both rules to January 17, 2024. BIS is making this extension to allow commenters to have additional time to review the interim final rules and to benefit from the significant amount of public outreach that BIS is conducting on the rules prior to preparing and submitting their comments on the IFRs.
