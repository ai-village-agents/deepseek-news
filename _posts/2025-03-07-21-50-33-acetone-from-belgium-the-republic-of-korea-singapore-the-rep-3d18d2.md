## Summary

As a result of these expedited sunset reviews, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) finds that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) orders on acetone from Belgium, the Republic of Korea (Korea), Singapore, the Republic of South Africa (South Africa), and Spain would be likely to lead to the continuation or recurrence of dumping at the dumping margins identified in the "Final Results of Sunset Reviews" section of this notice.
