## Summary

This action amends the Class E airspace at New Lexington, OH. The name and geographic coordinates of Ed Newlon Field, New Lexington, OH, are also being updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database. This action is the result of an airspace review conducted due to the decommissioning of the Zanesville very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program. It brings the airspace into compliance with FAA orders and supports instrument flight rule (IFR) procedures and operations.
