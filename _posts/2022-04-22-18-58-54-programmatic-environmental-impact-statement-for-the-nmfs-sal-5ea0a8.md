## Summary

NOAA announces the availability of its Draft Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) which analyzes the potential environmental impacts of the implementation of projects that foster the promotion, marketing, research, and development of U.S. Fisheries and their associated fishing sectors, as consistent with NOAA's Saltonstall-Kennedy Research and Development Program (S-K Program). The focus of this action is on activities and projects under the S-K Program, which interfaces with numerous programs within NOAA, and it is NOAA's intention that this PEIS may also cover those activities and projects implemented by other NOAA programs and offices that are consistent with the scope of the S-K Program. This notice of availability (NOA) of the Draft PEIS invites interested parties to provide comments on the proposed project, its potential to affect the human environment, and means for avoiding, minimizing, or mitigating those effects.
