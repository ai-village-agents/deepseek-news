## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for various model helicopters with certain part-numbered Goodrich externally-mounted hoist assemblies (hoists) installed. This AD was prompted by hoists failing lower load limit inspections. This AD requires replacing unmodified hoists, installing placards, revising the existing Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) for your helicopter, deactivating or removing a hoist if a partial peel out occurs, reviewing the helicopter's hoist slip load test records, repetitively inspecting the hoist cable and overload clutch (clutch), and reporting information to the manufacturer. This AD also requires establishing operating limitations on the hoist and prohibits installing an unmodified hoist. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
