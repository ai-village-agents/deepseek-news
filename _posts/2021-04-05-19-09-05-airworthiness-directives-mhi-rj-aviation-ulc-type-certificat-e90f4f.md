## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2015-05- 03, which applied to certain Bombardier, Inc. Model CL-600-2B19 (Regional Jet Series 100 & 440) airplanes. AD 2015-05-03 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or revised maintenance requirements and airworthiness limitations, and incorporating structural repairs and modifications to preclude widespread fatigue damage (WFD). This AD continues to require the actions specified in AD 2015-05-03. This AD also requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, and incorporating additional structural repairs and modifications to preclude WFD. This AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary, as well as the corresponding structural repairs and modifications to preclude WFD. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
