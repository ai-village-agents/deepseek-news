## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Commonwealth of Kentucky, through the Kentucky Division for Air Quality (KDAQ), on December 9, 2019. The SIP revision updates the description and attainment status designations of geographic areas within the Commonwealth for several National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS or standards). The updates are being made to conform Kentucky's attainment status tables with the federal attainment status designations for these areas. EPA is approving Kentucky's SIP revision because it is consistent with the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) and EPA's regulations.
