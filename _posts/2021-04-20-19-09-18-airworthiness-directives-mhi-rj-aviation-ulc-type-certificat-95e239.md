## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all MHI RJ Aviation ULC Model CL-600-2C10 (Regional Jet Series 700, 701 & 702) airplanes; Model CL-600-2C11 (Regional Jet Series 550) airplanes; Model CL-600-2D15 (Regional Jet Series 705) airplanes; Model CL-600- 2D24 (Regional Jet Series 900) airplanes; and Model CL-600-2E25 (Regional Jet Series 1000) airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that a new or more restrictive airworthiness limitation is necessary. This AD requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate a new or more restrictive airworthiness limitation. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
