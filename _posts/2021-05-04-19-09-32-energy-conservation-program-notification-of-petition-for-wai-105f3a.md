## Summary

This document announces receipt of and publishes a petition for waiver and interim waiver from Vinotemp International Corp. ("Vinotemp"), which seeks a waiver for specified walk-in cooler refrigeration system basic models from the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") test procedure used to determine the efficiency and energy consumption of walk-in coolers and walk-in freezers. DOE also gives notice of an Interim Waiver Order that requires Vinotemp to test and rate the specified walk-in cooler refrigeration system basic models in accordance with the alternate test procedure set forth in the Interim Waiver Order, which modifies the alternate test procedure suggested by Vinotemp. DOE solicits comments, data, and information concerning Vinotemp's petition, its suggested alternate test procedure, and the alternate test procedure specified in the Interim Waiver Order so as to inform DOE's final decision on Vinotemp's waiver request.
