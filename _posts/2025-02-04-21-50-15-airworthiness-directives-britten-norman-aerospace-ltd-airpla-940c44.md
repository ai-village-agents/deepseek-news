## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Britten-Norman Aerospace Ltd. Model BN-2, BN-2A, BN-2A-2, BN- 2A-3, BN-2A-6, BN-2A-8, BN-2A-9, BN-2A-20, BN-2A-21, BN-2A-26, BN-2A- 27, BN-2B-20, BN-2B-21, BN-2B-26, BN-2B-27, BN-2T, BN2T-4R, and BN2T-4S airplanes; and certain Model BN2A MK. III, BN2A MK. III-2, and BN2A MK. III-3 airplanes. This AD was prompted by the determination that, in order to ensure the continued structural integrity of certain landing gear and associated components, it is necessary to require removal of these components from service prior to exceeding established fatigue lives. This AD requires determining the number of landings on affected main landing gears (MLGs), nose landing gears (NLGs), and associated components; removing from service any part that has reached or exceeded the established fatigue life and installing a replacement part; and prohibiting the installation of any affected part unless the number of landings for that part is below the established fatigue life. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
