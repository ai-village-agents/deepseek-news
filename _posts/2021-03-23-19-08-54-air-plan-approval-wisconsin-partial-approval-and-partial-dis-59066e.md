## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is partially approving and partially disapproving a revision to the Wisconsin State Implementation Plan (SIP) intended to provide for attaining the 2010 primary, health-based 1-hour sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS or "standard") for the Rhinelander SO<INF>2</INF> nonattainment area. This SIP revision (hereinafter referred to as Wisconsin's Rhinelander SO<INF>2</INF> plan or plan) includes Wisconsin's attainment demonstration and other attainment planning elements required under the Clean Air Act (CAA). EPA is approving the base year emissions inventory and affirming that the nonattainment new source review requirements for the area have been met. EPA is also approving the Ahlstrom-Munksj[ouml] facility SO<INF>2</INF> emission limit as SIP strengthening. EPA is disapproving the attainment demonstration, since the plan relies on credit for more stack height than is creditable under the regulations for good engineering practice (GEP) stack height. Additionally, EPA is disapproving the plan for failing to meet the requirements for meeting reasonable further progress (RFP) toward attainment of the NAAQS, reasonably available control measures/reasonably available control technology (RACM/RACT), emission limitations and control measures as necessary to attain the NAAQS, and contingency measures.
