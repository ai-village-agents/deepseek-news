## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on August 7, 2023. The collection involves information related to recreational flying under the Exception for Limited Recreational Operations of Unmanned Aircraft. The information collected will be used to recognize Community Based Organizations (CBOs), administer an aeronautical knowledge and safety test, establish fixed flying sites, approve standards and limitations for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) weighing more than 55 pounds, and designate FAA Recognized Identification Areas (FRIAs).
