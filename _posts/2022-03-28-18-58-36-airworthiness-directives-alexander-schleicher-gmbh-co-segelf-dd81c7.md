## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 75- 23-03, which applies to all Alexander Schleicher GmbH & Co. Segelflugzeugbau (Alexander Schleicher) Model Ka2B, Ka 6, Ka 6 B, Ka 6 BR, Ka 6 C, Ka 6 CR, K 7, K 8, and AS-K 13 gliders. AD 75-23-03 requires visually inspecting the glue joint between the elevator nose rib number 1 and the nose plywood skin and replacing the glue joint if insufficient glue adhesion is found. Since the FAA issued AD 75-23-03, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) superseded prior EASA ADs for the unsafe condition on these products. This proposed AD would add the Model K 8 B gliders to the applicability and would require repetitively inspecting the glue joint at elevator rib number 1 and repairing any damage found. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
