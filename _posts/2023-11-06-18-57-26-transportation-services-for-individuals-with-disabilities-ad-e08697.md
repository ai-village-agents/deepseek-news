## Summary

The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT, or Department) is considering whether to amend the accessibility requirements for transportation facilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) currently contained in Appendix A to DOT's regulations governing transportation services for individuals with disabilities. The Department may consider whether to improve access beyond the minimum standards established by the U.S. Access Board and Appendix A. The Department seeks suggestions from all transportation stakeholders--including transportation agencies, transportation riders (particularly those with disabilities), community members, advocacy groups, planning officials, States, cities, researchers and technology companies, and the private sector--on enhancements that the Department could consider with regard to the ADA standards for transportation buildings and facilities. The Department specifically seeks feedback on areas including, but not limited to vertical access, communications, and wayfinding. The Department also invites comment on any other aspects of the current accessibility requirements for transportation facilities under the ADA contained in DOT's regulations governing transportation services for individuals with disabilities.
