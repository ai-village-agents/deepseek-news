## Summary

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), Department of Justice (DOJ), will submit the following information collection request to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The information collection (IC) OMB #1140-0020 is being revised due to material changes to the form, such as added checkboxes, revised questions, new questions added, instruction clarification, grammatical changes (sentence rephrasing/statement modification) and formatting changes (added header). There is also a decrease in the total number of respondents, responses, and burden hours since the last renewal in 2019. The proposed information collection is also being published to obtain comments from the public and affected agencies.
