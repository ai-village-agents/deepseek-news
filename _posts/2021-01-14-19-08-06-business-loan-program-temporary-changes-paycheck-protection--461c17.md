## Summary

On April 2, 2020, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) posted an interim final rule announcing the implementation of sections 1102 and 1106 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). Section 1102 of the CARES Act temporarily adds a new program, titled the "Paycheck Protection Program," to the SBA's 7(a) Loan Program. Section 1106 of the CARES Act provides for forgiveness of up to the full principal amount of qualifying loans guaranteed under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The PPP is intended to provide economic relief to small businesses nationwide adversely impacted by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Subsequently, SBA published twenty-three interim final rules providing additional guidance on the PPP (some of which were jointly issued with the Department of the Treasury) and Treasury published one interim final rule. On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act (Economic Aid Act) became law. The Economic Aid Act extends the authority to make PPP loans through March 31, 2021 and revises certain PPP requirements. This interim final rule incorporates the Economic Aid Act amendments required to be implemented by regulation within 10 days of enactment. For ease of borrower and lender reference, this interim final rule also consolidates the interim final rules (and important guidance) issued to date governing borrower eligibility, lender eligibility, and PPP application and origination requirements for new PPP loans, as well as provides general rules relating to loan increases and loan forgiveness. This rule is not intended to substantively alter or affect PPP rules that were not amended by the Economic Aid Act. Additional rules related to second draw PPP loans will be published separately, and SBA intends to issue a consolidated rule governing all aspects of loan forgiveness and the loan review process as well. This interim final rule is intended to govern new PPP loans made under the Economic Aid Act, as well as applications for loan forgiveness on existing PPP loans where the loan forgiveness payment has not been remitted, and should not be construed to alter or affect the requirements applicable to PPP loans closed prior to its enactment, unless the provisions apply retroactively consistent with specific applicability provisions of the Economic Aid Act as identified in this rule. In addition, in this interim final rule, Treasury exercises its authority under section 1109 of the CARES Act to allow borrowers of first draw PPP loans to use 2019 or 2020 to calculate their maximum loan amount.
