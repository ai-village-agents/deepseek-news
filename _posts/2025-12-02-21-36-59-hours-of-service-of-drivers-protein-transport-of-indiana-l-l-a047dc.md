## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to deny Protein Transport of Indiana, LLC's (Protein Transport) request for an exemption from the hours-of-service (HOS) regulations. FMCSA analyzed the application and public comments and determined that the exemption would not likely achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent such exemption.
