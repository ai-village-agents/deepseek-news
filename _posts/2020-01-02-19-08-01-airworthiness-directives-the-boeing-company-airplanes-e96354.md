## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directives (ADs) 2015-14-07, 2016-07-10, and 2016-24-09, which apply to The Boeing Company Model 787-8 and 787-9 airplanes. ADs 2015-14-07, 2016-07-10, and 2016-24-09 require actions related to certain flight control module (FCM) software. Since the FAA issued these ADs, the agency has received reports of unannunciated dual symmetric inboard slat skew and deficiencies in the FCM software. This proposed AD would also require installing flight control electronics (FCE) common block point 5 (CBP5) software, which would terminate the existing requirements. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
