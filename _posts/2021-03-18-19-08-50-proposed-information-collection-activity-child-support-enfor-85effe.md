## Summary

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is requesting a 3-year extension of the forms: OCSE-34 "Child Support Enforcement Program Quarterly Collection Report," and OCSE-396 "Child Support Enforcement Program Quarterly Financial Report." These forms are currently approved under the ACF Generic Clearance for Financial Reports (OMB #0970-0510; expiration May 31, 2021), and ACF is proposing to reinstate the previous OMB number under which these forms had been approved (OMB #0970-0181). There are no changes requested to the forms, but the instructions have been updated for clarity and to update the current fee amounts.
