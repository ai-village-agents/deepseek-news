## Summary

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing a proposed rule to expand the authority to approve waivers of the normal payment limitations on recruitment and relocation incentives. An expansion of the waiver approval authority would provide agencies with access to higher payment limitations for these flexibilities without requesting approval from OPM. Under this proposed rule, agencies would have the authority to approve a recruitment or relocation incentive of up to 50 percent of an employee's annual rate of basic pay multiplied by the number of years in a service agreement (not to exceed 100 percent of annual basic pay) based on a critical agency need. In addition, this proposed rule would give agencies flexibility to set the length of the required service period for recruitment incentives to a period less than 6 months but not more than 4 years, which would align the service requirements for recruitment incentives with those for relocation incentives and provide agencies with additional flexibility in taking advantage of this incentive as a recruitment tool.
