## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, are initiating 5-year status reviews for 35 species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A 5-year review is an assessment of the best scientific and commercial data available at the time of the review. We are requesting submission of any such information that has become available since the previous status review for each species.
