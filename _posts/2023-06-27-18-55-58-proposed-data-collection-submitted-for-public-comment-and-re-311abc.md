## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Data Calls for the Laboratory Response Network (LRN). These Data Calls are needed to address issues concerning the response capabilities of member facilities for priority threat agents or to assess the network's ability to respond to new emerging threats.
