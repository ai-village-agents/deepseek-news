## Summary

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), as amended, authorizes a noncompetitive grant program to establish or enhance state and tribal response programs. Generally, these response programs address the assessment, cleanup, and redevelopment of brownfields and other sites with actual or perceived contamination. Due to the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act ("Infrastructure Law") in November 2021, EPA is now issuing this notice of a FY 2022 Funding Guidance to provide information and instruction to states and tribes requesting FY 2022 Section 128(a) funding provided by the Infrastructure Law. EPA anticipates that it may allocate approximately $57.9 million in FY 2022 Section 128(a) Infrastructure Law funds.
