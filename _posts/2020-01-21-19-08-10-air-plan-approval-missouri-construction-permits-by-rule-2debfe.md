## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the Missouri State Implementation Plan (SIP) received on March 7, 2019. The submission revises a Missouri regulation that creates a process for exempting certain sources from construction permit obligations by establishing conditions under which these sources can construct and operate without going through the State's formal construction permitting process. Specifically, the revisions to the rule provide crematories and animal incinerators a compliance option and modify restrictions on what these units can incinerate, matches Federal sulfur limits on Number 2 diesel oil, removes "restrictive" words, adds definitions specific to the rule, and makes other minor edits. The revisions do not impact the stringency of the SIP or air quality. Approval of these revisions will ensure consistency between State and federally-approved rules.
