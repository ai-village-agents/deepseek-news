## Summary

All ten (10) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Regions are finalizing the 2022 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) general permit for stormwater discharges from construction activities, also referred to as the "2022 Construction General Permit," the "2022 CGP," or the "final permit." The final permit will replace the 2017 CGP that will expire at midnight on February 16, 2022. EPA is issuing this permit for five (5) years to provide permit coverage to eligible operators in all areas of the country where EPA is the NPDES permitting authority, including Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Mexico, oil and gas activities within Oklahoma, most Indian country lands, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories and protectorates except for the U.S. Virgin Islands, and certain federal facilities. This Federal Register document summarizes the final permit. The final permit and fact sheet can be found at https://www.epa.gov/npdes/2022- construction-general-permit-cgp. EPA's responses to public comments that were submitted in response to the proposed 2022 CGP may be found in the docket for this action (Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OW-2021-0169).
