## Summary

The U.S. Copyright Office is issuing a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking to update its October 25, 2022 proposed rule regarding the applicability of the derivative works exception to termination rights under the Copyright Act to the new statutory mechanical blanket license established by the Music Modernization Act. This supplemental notice modifies the proposed rule and expands its scope in light of comments received in response to the previous notice. In addition to addressing the applicability of the derivative works exception, the supplemental proposed rule addresses other matters relevant to identifying the proper payee to whom the mechanical licensing collective must distribute royalties. Among other things, the Office proposes adopting regulations addressing the mechanical licensing collective's distribution of matched historical royalties and administration of ownership transfers, requests to designate alternative royalty payees, and related disputes. The Office invites public comments on the supplemental proposed rule.
