## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in response to a request under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended, from Narwhal LLC, propose to authorize nonlethal, incidental take by harassment of small numbers of Pacific walruses (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) and Southern Beaufort Sea (SBS) polar bears (Ursus maritimus) between August 1, 2025, and July 31, 2026. The applicant requested this authorization for take by harassment that may result from activities associated with shallow hazard surveys, preliminary field surveys, exploratory drilling operations, and summer cleanup activities in West Harrison Bay, Alaska. This proposed authorization, if finalized, will be for up to 15 takes of walruses and 13 takes of polar bears by Level B harassment only. No take by injury or mortality is requested, expected, or proposed to be authorized. We invite comments on the proposed incidental harassment authorization and the accompanying draft environmental assessment from the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies.
