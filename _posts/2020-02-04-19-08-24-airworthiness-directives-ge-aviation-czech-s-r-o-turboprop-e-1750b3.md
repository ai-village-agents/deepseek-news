## Summary

The FAA is revising an earlier proposal for all GE Aviation Czech s.r.o. M601D-11, M601E-11, M601E-11A, M601E-11AS, M601E-11S, M601F, H80, H80-100, H80-200, H75-100, H75-200, H85-100, and H85-200 turboprop engines. This action revises the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) by revising the compliance time requirements for replacement of affected engine outlet system hardware. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive (AD) to address the unsafe condition on these products. At the request of some commenters, the FAA is reopening the comment period to allow the public the chance to comment on these changes.
