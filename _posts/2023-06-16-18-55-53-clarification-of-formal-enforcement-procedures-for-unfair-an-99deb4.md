## Summary

The U.S. Department of Transportation (Department or DOT) is amending its regulations regarding the formal enforcement procedures that are available if the DOT's Office of Aviation Consumer Protection (OACP) takes enforcement action against an airline or ticket agent, and efforts to settle the matter through a consent order are unsuccessful. Consistent with existing law, this final rule clarifies that DOT may bring a civil action in a United States District Court.
