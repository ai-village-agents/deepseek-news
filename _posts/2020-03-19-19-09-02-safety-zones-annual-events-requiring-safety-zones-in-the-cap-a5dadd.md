## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to amend the rules that regulate vessel traffic and control navigation on portions of waterways in the Lake Michigan Captain of the Port Zone during events that will introduce safety concerns to life and property on the navigable waters of the United States. This proposed rulemaking will reorganize the table listing these safety zones into four separate tables organized by the State in which the safety zone occurs, make minor formatting changes for consistency, update the dates listed for some events, consolidate one safety zone, and remove six safety zones that are no longer necessary. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
