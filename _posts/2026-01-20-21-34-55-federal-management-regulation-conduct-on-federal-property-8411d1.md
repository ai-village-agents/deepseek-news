## Summary

The General Services Administration (GSA), in consultation with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is removing and reserving a subpart of the Federal Management Regulation (FMR) pertaining to conduct on Federal property. DHS recently published a final rule, effective November 5, 2025, establishing regulations for the protection of Federal property. GSA's final rule will remove GSA regulations that are duplicative of DHS's new regulation. This final rule supports the deregulatory requirements of Executive Order issued January 31, 2025, titled "Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation."
