In accordance with section 122(i) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended ("CERCLA"), notice is hereby given by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), Region 5, of a proposed administrative settlement for recovery of past response costs concerning the Seerley Rd Fire Site (Site) in Indianapolis, Indiana with the following parties: Steven Williamson and Joel I. Williamson Junior, as the Settling Parties and Respondents. The settlement requires the Respondents to pay $800,000 in past response costs. The settlement includes a covenant not to sue pursuant to sections 106 and 107 of CERCLA, relating to the Site, subject to limited reservations, and protection from contribution actions or claims as provided by section 113(f)(2) of CERCLA.
