## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-100-1A10 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of cracks found in the tailcone upper firewall where the auxiliary power unit (APU) muffler electrical bonding strap is attached. This AD requires a detailed visual inspection of the tailcone upper firewall for defects, rework by replacement of the APU electrical bonding strap, and repair if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
