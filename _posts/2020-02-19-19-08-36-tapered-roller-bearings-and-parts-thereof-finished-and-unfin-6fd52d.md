## Summary

The Department of Commerce (Commerce) determines that it is appropriate to rescind this administrative review of the antidumping duty order on tapered roller bearings and parts thereof, finished and unfinished (TRBs), from the People's Republic of China (China) with respect to three of the four companies involved in this review because they had no bona fide (i.e., reviewable) sales to the United States during the period of review (POR), June 1, 2017 through May 31, 2018. Further, Commerce finds that the fourth respondent is not eligible for a separate rate.
