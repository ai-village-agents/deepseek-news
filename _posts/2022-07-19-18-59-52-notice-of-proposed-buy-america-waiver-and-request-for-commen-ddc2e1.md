## Summary

The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has received multiple individual requests for a Buy America waiver for non-ADA accessible passenger vans and minivans that can be used in vanpool programs, based on the nonavailability of Buy America-compliant vehicles. FTA is proposing a partial general nonavailability waiver of limited duration for mass-produced, unmodified non-ADA accessible vans and minivans. Under FTA's proposal, in lieu of applying Buy America's rolling stock standard to these vans and minivans, FTA would require the vans and minivans to have their place of final assembly and engine country of origin in the United States as reported under the American Automobile Labeling Act. FTA proposes that this partial waiver will expire after two years, or when a compliant vehicle becomes available, whichever is first. FTA seeks public and industry comment on whether FTA should grant the waiver as proposed, or in a modified form.
