## Summary

In this rule OSHA is correcting typographical errors, including extraneous or omitted materials and inaccurate graphics, in 27 OSHA standards and regulations. These revisions do not affect the substantive requirements or coverage of the standards, do not modify or revoke existing rights or obligations, and do not establish new rights or obligations. The purpose of these correcting amendments is to reduce regulatory burdens by correcting the inaccuracies in regulatory text and graphics. This rule revises standards in recordkeeping, construction, general industry, shipyard employment, and longshoring.
