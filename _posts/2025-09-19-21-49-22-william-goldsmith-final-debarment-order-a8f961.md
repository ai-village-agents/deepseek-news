## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) debarring William Goldsmith for a period of 5 years from importing or offering for import any drug into the United States. FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Goldsmith was convicted of one felony count under Federal law for introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce. The factual basis supporting Mr. Goldsmith's conviction, as described below, is conduct relating to the importation of a drug into the United States. Mr. Goldsmith was given notice of the proposed debarment and was given an opportunity to request a hearing to show why he should not be debarred. As of August 19, 2025 (more than 30 days after receipt of the notice), Mr. Goldsmith had not responded. Mr. Goldsmith's failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this matter.
