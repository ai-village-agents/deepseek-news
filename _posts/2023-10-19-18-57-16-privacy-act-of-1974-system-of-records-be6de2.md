## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC, Commission, or Agency) proposes to modify an existing system of records, FCC/WTB-1, Wireless Services Licensing Records, subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. This action is necessary to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act to publish in the Federal Register notice of the existence and character of records maintained by the agency. The Commission uses records in this system to administer the Commission's regulatory responsibilities including licensing, enforcement, rulemaking, and other actions necessary to perform spectrum management duties. This modification makes various necessary changes and updates, including formatting changes required by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-108 since its previous publication, the addition of four new routine uses, as well as the revision of six existing routine uses and the deletion of one existing routine use.
