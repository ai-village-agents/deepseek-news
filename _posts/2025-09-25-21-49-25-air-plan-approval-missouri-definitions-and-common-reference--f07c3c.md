## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve revisions to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the State of Missouri related to Definitions and Common Reference Tables used in Missouri rules. EPA has also previously approved this rule as part of the air planning and permitting program. Some of the definitions are associated with those programs, even though many of the definitions pertain only to the SIP. These revisions do not impact the stringency of the SIP or have an adverse effect on air quality. The EPA's final approval of this rule revision is being done in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
