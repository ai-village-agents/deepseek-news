## Summary

NMFS announces its intent to conduct a 5-year review of the threatened Beringia and Okhotsk distinct population segments (DPSs) of the Pacific bearded seal subspecies Erignathus barbatus nauticus. NMFS is required by the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to conduct 5-year reviews to ensure that listing classifications of species are accurate. The 5-year review must be based on the best scientific and commercial data available at the time of the review. We request submission of any such information on these bearded seal DPSs, particularly information on their status, threats, and recovery, that has become available since their listing on December 28, 2012.
