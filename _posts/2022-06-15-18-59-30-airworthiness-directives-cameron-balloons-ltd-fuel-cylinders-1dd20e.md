## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Cameron Balloons Ltd. (Cameron) fuel cylinders installed on hot air balloons. This AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as cracks in the weld between the cylinder valve plate and the upper dished end of Cameron part number (P/N) CB2990 (Alugas) fuel cylinders, which could allow uncontrolled fuel leakage of liquid propane. This AD requires the removal of any installed P/N CB2990 (Alugas) fuel cylinder from service before further flight. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
