## Summary

The Administration for Children and Families' (ACF) Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) intends to collect demographic, programmatic, and outcome data on Services for Survivors of Torture (SOT) grant recipients and the clients they serve. This data collection will allow ORR to learn more about the populations served; the types and effectiveness of services provided; methods, challenges, and facilitators of implementing services; and grant recipients' progress towards programmatic goals. ORR will collect these data on the new cohort of Services for SOT grant recipients; ORR collected information from the previous grantee cohort under the Generic Performance Progress Report (OMB #0970-0490). ORR has made changes to the data collection instruments for use in the new cohort.
