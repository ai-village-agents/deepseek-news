## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC" or "Commission") is announcing an opportunity for public comment on the proposed renewal of an information collection by the agency. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act ("PRA"), Federal agencies are required to publish notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of information and to allow 60 days for public comment. This notice solicits comments on the information collections pertaining to the Commission's swap data recordkeeping and reporting requirements. These rules impose recordkeeping and reporting requirements on the following entities: Swap Dealers ("SDs"), Major Swap Participants ("MSPs"), Swap Execution Facilities ("SEFs"), designated contract markets ("DCMs"), swap data repositories ("SDRs"), derivatives clearing organizations ("DCOs"), and swap counterparties that are neither swap dealers nor major swap participants ("non-SD/MSP counterparties").
