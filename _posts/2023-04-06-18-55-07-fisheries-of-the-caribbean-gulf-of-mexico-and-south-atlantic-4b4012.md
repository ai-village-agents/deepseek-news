## Summary

The Caribbean Fishery Management Council (Council) has submitted Amendment 1 to the Puerto Rico Fishery Management Plan (FMP), Amendment 1 to the St. Croix FMP, and Amendment 1 to the St. Thomas and St. John FMP (jointly Amendments 1) for review, approval, and implementation by NMFS. If approved by the Secretary of Commerce, Amendments 1 would modify the authorized gear types to prohibit the use of buoy gear by the recreational sector in U.S. Caribbean Federal waters and modify the regulatory definition of buoy gear to increase the maximum number of hooks from 10 to 25 in U.S. Caribbean Federal waters for fisheries where buoy gear is authorized. The purpose of Amendments 1 is to allow commercial fishermen targeting deep-water fish, including snappers and groupers, in the U.S. Caribbean Federal waters to use buoy gear with up to 25 hooks, while protecting deep-water reef fish resources and habitats and minimizing user conflicts.
