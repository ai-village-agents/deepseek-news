## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for the navigable waters within 100 yards of the North Washington Street Bridge, Charles River, Boston, Massachusetts, from February 1, 2020 through December 31, 2023. The temporary safety zone is necessary to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards created during the replacement project of the North Washington Street Bridge. When enforced, this rule would prohibit vessels and persons from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port (COTP) Boston or a designated representative.
