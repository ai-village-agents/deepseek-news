## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, announce the availability of a draft habitat conservation plan (HCP) and draft categorical exclusion (CatEx) for activities associated with an application for an incidental take permit (ITP) under the Endangered Species Act. The ITP would authorize take of the Santa Barbara County distinct population segment of the California tiger salamander incidental to activities associated with Golden State Water Company's (applicant) Kelt Reservoir Project in Orcutt, Santa Barbara County, California. The applicant developed the draft HCP as part of their application for an ITP. The Service prepared a draft low-effect screening form and environmental action statement in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act to evaluate the potential effects to the natural and human environment resulting from issuing an ITP to the applicant. We invite comments from the public and Federal, Tribal, State, and local governments.
