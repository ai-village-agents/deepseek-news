## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to find that the Newport State Park nonattainment area in Door County, Wisconsin is attaining the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS or standard) and to act in accordance with a request from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) to redesignate the area to attainment for the 2015 ozone NAAQS, because the request meets the statutory requirements for redesignation under the Clean Air Act (CAA). Wisconsin submitted this request on January 27, 2020. EPA is also proposing to approve, as a revision to the Wisconsin State Implementation Plan (SIP), the state's plan for maintaining the 2015 ozone NAAQS through 2030 in the Newport State Park area. Finally, EPA finds adequate and is proposing to approve Wisconsin's 2023 and 2030 volatile organic compound (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) Motor Vehicle Emission Budgets (MVEBs) for this area.
