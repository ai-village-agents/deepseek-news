## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2016-14- 03, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, - 115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, - 213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2016-14-03 required reinforcing the forward pressure bulkhead at a certain stringer on both the left-hand and right-hand sides and doing related investigative and corrective actions if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2016-14-03, new crack findings have prompted the need for repetitive inspections of the area. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2016-14-03, adds repetitive inspections of structure at a certain frame and applicable corrective actions, provides a terminating action for the repetitive inspections, and revises the applicability by removing airplanes and adding certain airplane models. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
