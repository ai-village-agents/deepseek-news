## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves protection of voluntarily submitted information. Part 193 of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations provides that certain information submitted to the FAA on a voluntary basis is not to be disclosed. This part implements a statutory provision. The purpose of part 193 is to encourage the aviation community to voluntarily share information with the FAA so that the agency may work cooperatively with industry to identify modifications to rules, policies, and procedures needed to improve safety, security, and efficiency of the National Airspace System (NAS). The information collection associated with part 193 also supports the Department of Transportation's Strategic Goal of Safety and Security.
