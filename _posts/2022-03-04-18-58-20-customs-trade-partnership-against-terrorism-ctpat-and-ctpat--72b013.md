## Summary

On February 18, 2022, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) published a document in the Federal Register requesting comments from the public and affected agencies on revisions to the information collection, in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), that is part of Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (CTPAT) and the CTPAT Trade Compliance Program. The document contained information about the CTPAT Portal that was in the process of being updated to meet current modern computing standards and to allow for updates to the minimum-security criteria. Due to unforeseen developmental delays, CBP is pausing proposed updates to these internal systems. This document corrects the February 18, 2022 document to remove inaccurate references in light of the paused updates, and to add certain types of CTPAT program participants that were inadvertently omitted from the list in the Abstract.
