## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to list three Tennessee and Cumberland River basin mussel species, the Tennessee clubshell (Pleurobema oviforme), Tennessee pigtoe (Pleuronaia barnesiana), and Cumberland moccasinshell (Medionidus conradicus), as endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). This determination also serves as our 12-month finding on a petition to list the three species. After a review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that listing the Tennessee clubshell, Tennessee pigtoe, and Cumberland moccasinshell as endangered species is warranted. If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would extend the Act's protections to these species.
