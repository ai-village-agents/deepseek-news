## Summary

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to receive input from the public as CISA develops proposed regulations required by the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA). Among other things, CIRCIA directs CISA to develop and oversee implementation of regulations requiring covered entities to submit to CISA reports detailing covered cyber incidents and ransom payments. CIRCIA requires CISA to publish a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) within 24 months of the date of enactment of CIRCIA as part of the process for developing these regulations. CISA is interested in receiving public input on potential aspects of the proposed regulation prior to publication of the NPRM and is issuing this RFI as a means to receive that input. While CISA welcomes input on other aspects of CIRCIA's regulatory requirements, CISA is particularly interested in input on definitions for and interpretations of the terminology to be used in the proposed regulations; the form, manner, content, and procedures for submission of reports required under CIRCIA; information regarding other incident reporting requirements including the requirement to report a description of the vulnerabilities exploited; and other policies and procedures, such as enforcement procedures and information protection policies, that will be required for implementation of the regulations.
