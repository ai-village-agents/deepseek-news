## Summary

The Maine Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Standards submitted documentation attesting to the completion of all structural and developmental aspects of its State Plan for State and Local Government Employees as approved by OSHA. After extensive review of the submissions and opportunity for correction, the Maine State Plan (MEOSH) submitted updated and revised documents. OSHA is approving the revised State Plan, which documents the satisfactory completion of all structural and developmental aspects of Maine's approved State Plan, and is certifying this completion. This certification attests to the fact that the Maine State Plan now has in place those structural components necessary for an effective State Plan for State and Local Government Employees. (Enforcement of occupational safety and health standards with regard to private sector employers and employees in the State of Maine remains the responsibility of the U.S. Department of Labor, OSHA.)
