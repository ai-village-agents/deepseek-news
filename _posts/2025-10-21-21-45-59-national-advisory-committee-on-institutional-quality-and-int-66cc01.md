## Summary

The Department of Education announced in the Federal Register on September 17, 2025, that it would host a meeting of the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity (NACIQI or Committee) on October 21, 2025. In this notice, the Department announces a change in the meeting date to December 16, 2025, because of the current lapse in appropriations. This notice sets forth the agenda, time, and instructions to access or participate in the NACIQI meeting on December 16, 2025, and provides information to members of the public regarding the meeting and how to make a request to submit written or oral comments. Committee members will meet in person. Agency representatives have the option to meet in person or virtually, and public attendees can participate virtually. Like the September 17, 2025, announcement, this meeting notice is required under the Federal Advisory Committee Act and the Higher Education Act (HEA).
