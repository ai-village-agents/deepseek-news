## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency is planning to submit an information collection request (ICR), "Air Pollution Regulations for Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Activities" (EPA ICR No. 1601.10, OMB Control No. 2060-0249), to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Before doing so, the EPA is soliciting public comments on specific aspects of the proposed information collection as described below. This is a proposed renewal of the ICR, which is currently approved through September 30, 2020. An Agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
