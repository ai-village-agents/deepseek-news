## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to modify the operating schedule that governs the Seaboard System Railroad Bridge, across the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 28.2, at Indiantown, Florida. This proposed change would allow the swing bridge to be remotely operated, change the start and end times for advance notification for an opening during the overnight hours and update the name of the bridge. The Coast Guard is seeking comments from the public regarding the proposed changes.
