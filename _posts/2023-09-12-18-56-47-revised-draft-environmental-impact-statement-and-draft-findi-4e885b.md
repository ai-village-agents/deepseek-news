## Summary

This notice announces the availability of the revised Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS), which examines the potential environmental impacts from the expansion and modernization of the Raul Hector Castro (RHC) Land Port of Entry (LPOE) in Douglas, Arizona and construction of a new Commercial LPOE to address various operational, capacity, and safety issues associated with the existing facility. Following issuance of the original DEIS in January 2023, GSA identified a third action alternative--Alternative 3--through internal scoping. Due to the change in the analysis, GSA is re-issuing a revised DEIS for public review during a 45-day comment period. The DEIS describes the purpose and need for the project; alternatives considered; the existing environment that could be affected; the potential impacts resulting from each of the alternatives; and proposed best management practices and/or mitigation measures. The revised DEIS also includes the revised Draft Finding of No Practicable Alternative (FONPA), which provides a floodplain assessment and statement of findings as a result of construction in a floodplain at the RHC LPOE.
