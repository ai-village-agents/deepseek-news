## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a reinstatement of a currently approved data collection titled "Development of CDC's Let's Stop HIV Together Social Marketing Campaign for Consumers". The purpose of this data collection is to inform the development of messages, concepts, and materials for CDC's Let's Stop HIV Together social marketing campaign for the general public and subpopulations at increased risk for HIV acquisition or transmission in support of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Ending the HIV Epidemic.
