## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; Model A319-111, - 112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, - 112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports that during inspections accomplished in accordance with certain airworthiness limitation items (ALIs), cracks were detected in double joggle areas at frame (FR) 16 and FR20, right hand and left hand sides. This proposed AD would require repetitive special detailed inspections of certain areas and applicable on- condition actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
