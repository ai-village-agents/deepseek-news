## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") proposes to amend the test procedure for commercial and industrial pumps ("pumps") to harmonize with updated industry standards, to expand the scope of clean water pumps covered by this test procedure, and to revise calculation methods for pumps sold with motors and controls to better represent field energy use. DOE is seeking comment from interested parties on the proposal and announcing a public meeting to collect comments and data on its proposal.
