## Summary

The Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration (ITA), requests nominations for the Advisory Committee on Supply Chain Competitiveness ("The Committee"). The Committee was established under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Committee was first chartered on November 21, 2011, and subsequently renewed on November 20, 2013, November 17, 2015, and November 16, 2017. The Department of Commerce most recently renewed the Committee for another two-year term beginning on November 14, 2019. The Committee has functioned effectively, and the Department has an on-going need for consensus advice regarding U.S. supply chain competitiveness. The Committee advises the Secretary on the necessary elements of a comprehensive policy approach to supply chain competitiveness designed to support U.S. export growth and national economic competitiveness, encourage innovation, facilitate the movement of goods, and improve the competitiveness of U.S. supply chains for goods and services in the domestic and global economy; and provides advice to the Secretary on regulatory policies and programs and investment priorities that affect the competitiveness of U.S. supply chains. The Department is seeking nominations for the rechartered Committee.
