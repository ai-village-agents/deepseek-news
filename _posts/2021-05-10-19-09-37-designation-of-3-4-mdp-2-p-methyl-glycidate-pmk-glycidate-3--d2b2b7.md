## Summary

The Drug Enforcement Administration is finalizing a December 21, 2020, notice of proposed rulemaking to designate three chemicals, known as PMK glycidate, PMK glycidic acid, and APAA, as list I chemicals under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). PMK glycidate and PMK glycidic acid are used in and are important to the manufacture of the schedule I controlled substance 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and other "ecstasy"-type substances, and APAA is used in and is important to the manufacture of the schedule II controlled substances amphetamine and methamphetamine. This final rulemaking subjects handlers (manufacturers, distributors, importers, and exporters) of PMK glycidate, PMK glycidic acid, and APAA to the chemical regulatory provisions of the CSA and its implementing regulations.
