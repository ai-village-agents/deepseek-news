## Summary

NMFS corrects the final rule that implemented management measures described in Amendment 49 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Snapper-Grouper Fishery of the South Atlantic Region (FMP), which published in the Federal Register on September 26, 2023. For greater amberjack, that final rule revised the sector annual catch limits (ACLs), the commercial minimum size limit, the commercial seasonal trip limits, and the April spawning season closure. In addition, Amendment 49 revised the overfishing limit, acceptable biological catch, annual optimum yield, and sector allocations of the total ACL, as well as removed the recreational annual catch targets for species in the FMP. In that final rule, NMFS inadvertently neglected to include a previously contained commercial quota provision that did not change through Amendment 49, and did not include a commercial trip limit paragraph heading that did not change through Amendment 49. The purpose of this correcting amendment is to fix these errors.
