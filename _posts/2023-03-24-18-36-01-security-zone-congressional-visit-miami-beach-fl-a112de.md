## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary security zone for certain navigable waters of Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway near Miami Beach, Florida. The moving security zone will encompass all navigable waters within 100 yards of the M/V BISCAYNE LADY. This action is necessary to protect an official party, public, and surrounding waterways from terrorist acts, sabotage or other subversive acts, accidents, or other events of a similar nature. Entry of vessels or persons into this zone is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port (COTP) Miami, or a designated representative.
