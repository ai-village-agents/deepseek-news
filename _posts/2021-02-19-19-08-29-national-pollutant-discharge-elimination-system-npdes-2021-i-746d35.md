## Summary

All 10 of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Regions are finalizing the 2021 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) general permit for stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, also referred to as the "2021 Multi-Sector General Permit (MSGP)" or the "final permit." This final permit replaces EPA's administratively continued 2015 MSGP that expired on June 3, 2020. EPA is issuing this permit for five (5) years to provide permit coverage to eligible operators in all areas of the country where EPA is the NPDES permitting authority, including Idaho (until July 1, 2021), Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Indian country lands, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and most U.S. territories and protectorates. This Federal Register document summarizes the final permit. EPA encourages the public to read the final permit and accompanying fact sheet to better understand the final permit. The final permit and fact sheet can be found at https://www.epa.gov/npdes/ stormwater-discharges-industrial-activities.
