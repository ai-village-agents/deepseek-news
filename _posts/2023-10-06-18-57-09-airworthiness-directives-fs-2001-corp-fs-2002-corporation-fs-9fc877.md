## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain FS 2001 Corp, FS 2002 Corporation, FS 2003 Corporation, Piper, and Piper Aircraft, Inc. (Piper) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of broken rudders. This proposed AD would require replacing any rudder equipped with a rudder post made from a certain carbon steel with a rudder equipped with a rudder post made from a certain low-alloy steel. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
