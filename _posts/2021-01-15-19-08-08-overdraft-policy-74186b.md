## Summary

The NCUA Board (Board) is issuing a proposed rule to amend one of the requirements that a federal credit union (FCU) must adopt as a part of their written overdraft policy. Specifically, the proposed rule would modify the requirement that an FCU's written overdraft policy establish a time limit, not to exceed 45 calendar days, for a member to either deposit funds or obtain an approved loan from the FCU to cover each overdraft. The proposed rule would remove the 45-day limit and replace it with a requirement that the written policy must establish a specific time limit that is both reasonable and applicable to all members, for a member either to deposit funds or obtain an approved loan from the credit union to cover each overdraft. Consistent with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), overdraft balances should generally be charged off when considered uncollectible. The Board believes that this change would improve a requirement that is not only overly prescriptive, but could be especially detrimental as FCUs take steps to provide their members the flexibility needed to cope with the impacts of COVID-19.
