## Summary

This document provides the public with notice that, on July 8, 2025, the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority (SFRV) submitted a request for amendment (RFA) to its FRA-certified Positive Train Control Safety Plan (PTCSP) and positive train control (PTC) system, seeking FRA's approval to temporarily disable its PTC system between Milepost (MP) SX1015.82 and MP SX1022.29 for a planned signal cutover that will last approximately two days and six hours, between September 19, 2025, and September 22, 2025. As this RFA may involve a request for FRA's approval of proposed material modifications to an FRA-certified PTC system, FRA is publishing this notice, and inviting public comment on SFRV's RFA to its PTC system.
