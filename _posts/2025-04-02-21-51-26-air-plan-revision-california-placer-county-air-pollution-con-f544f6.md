## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the Placer County Air Pollution Control District (PCAPCD or "District") portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). This revision concerns the District's Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act") nonattainment new source review permitting program that regulates construction and modifications of major stationary sources of air pollution in nonattainment areas. We are proposing to approve a local rule that has been revised to address deficiencies previously identified by the EPA in a prior action that included a limited approval/limited disapproval of a prior version of the rule. We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action. Elsewhere in this Federal Register, we are making an interim final determination that will defer the imposition of CAA sanctions associated with our previous limited disapproval.
