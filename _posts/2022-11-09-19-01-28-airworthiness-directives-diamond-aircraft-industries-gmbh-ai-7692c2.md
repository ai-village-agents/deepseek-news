## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Diamond Aircraft Industries GmbH (DAI) Model DA 42, DA 42 NG, and DA 42 M-NG airplanes. This AD is prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) issued by the aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI describes the unsafe condition as a loose rudder T-yoke axle nut. This AD requires replacing the rudder T-yoke axle with an improved rudder T-yoke axle. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
