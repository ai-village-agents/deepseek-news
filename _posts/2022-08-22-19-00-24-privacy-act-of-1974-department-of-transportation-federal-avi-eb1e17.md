## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), proposes to rename, update and reissue an existing system of records notice currently titled "Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, DOT/FAA 807, Traffic Control at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center." The Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC) is located in Oklahoma City, OK and is home to more than 8,000 full[hyphen]time employees and receives 10,000 visitors per month. It encompasses approximately 1,100 acres and 133 buildings and conducts training for DOT/FAA employees and contractors, and other federal employees (including employees of federal agencies who are tenants at the MMAC). Tenants are federal agencies who pay to lease space on the MMAC campus. The Director for the Office of Facilities and Management (AMP-1), the Security and Investigations Division (AMC-700) and the MMAC Operations and Maintenance Division (AMP-300), are responsible for maintaining access control to the facility including the administration of policies, programs and activities related to access to the MMAC facilities, as well as managing tasks related to vehicle registrations, key issuance, visitors (members of the public, including federal employees attending training or special events, short-term vendors, and research participants), as well as tenants and DOT/FAA employees and contractors assigned to the MMAC campus. These functions ensure that only authorized personnel obtain access and entrance to facilities located at the MMAC campus and that pedestrian and vehicular traffic within the campus is controlled and orderly.
