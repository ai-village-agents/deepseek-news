## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited Model DHC-8-400, -401, and -402 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that the epoxy primer on the internal bore of the nacelle and landing gear attachment pins was not applied, and corrosion on the internal bore of the wing rear spar attachment pins was found. This AD requires doing a detailed visual inspection of the nacelle to wing rear spar attachment pins, and the nacelle and landing gear attachment pins, for any corrosion, and doing all applicable corrective actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
