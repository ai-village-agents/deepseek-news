## Summary

The Department of Labor (DOL), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, conducts a pre- clearance consultation program to provide the general public and Federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on proposed and/or continuing collections of information in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The program helps ensure that requested data can be provided in the desired format, reporting burden (time and financial resources) is minimized, collection instruments are clearly understood, and the impact of collection requirements on respondents can be properly assessed. The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) is soliciting comments concerning its proposal to obtain approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for renewal of the information collection for its construction program which includes the recordkeeping and reporting requirements associated with the program. This request includes two information collection instruments: the construction compliance review scheduling letter and itemized listing (collectively referred to as the "construction scheduling letter") and the Construction Contract Award Notification Requirement Form (CC-314). OFCCP proposes changes to the currently authorized construction scheduling letter and CC-314. The current OMB approval for the construction scheduling letter and CC-314 expires on July 31, 2024. A copy of the proposed information collection request can be obtained by contacting the office listed below in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section of this notice or by accessing it at www.regulations.gov.
