## Summary

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is requesting a 3-year extension of the Grant Application Instrument and Instructions (Office of Management and Budget (OMB) #0970-0207, expiration June 30, 2025). The updated grant application reduces the amount of documentation required from grant recipients, both in the baseline application and the continuation application, by reducing the number of required documents to support the application and reducing the amount of required information in the program and budget justification narrative. The goal of these changes is to reduce grant recipient burden.
