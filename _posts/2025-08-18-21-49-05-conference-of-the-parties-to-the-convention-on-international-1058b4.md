## Summary

To implement the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES or the Convention), the Parties to the Convention meet periodically to review what species in international trade should be regulated and other aspects of CITES implementation. The twentieth regular meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES (CoP20) is scheduled to take place in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, November 24-December 5, 2025. Currently, the United States is developing its negotiating positions on proposed resolutions, decisions, and amendments to the CITES Appendices (species proposals), as well as other agenda items that have been submitted by other Parties, the permanent CITES committees, and the CITES Secretariat for consideration at CoP20. With this notice, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the provisional agenda for CoP20, solicits your comments on the items on the provisional agenda, and schedules a public meeting to seek comments on the items included in the provisional agenda.
