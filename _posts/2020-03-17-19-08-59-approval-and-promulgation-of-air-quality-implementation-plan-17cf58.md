## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of West Virginia. Whenever new or revised national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or standards) are promulgated, the Clean Air Act (CAA) requires states to make an initial SIP submission to provide for the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of such NAAQS. This submission is required to address basic program elements, including, but not limited to, regulatory structure, monitoring, modeling, legal authority, and adequate resources necessary to assure attainment and maintenance of the standards. This type of SIP revision is commonly referred to as an "infrastructure" SIP and elements addressed in such a submission are referred to as infrastructure requirements. West Virginia made a submittal addressing most of the infrastructure requirements for the 2015 ozone NAAQS and later supplemented the submittal to address the interstate transport elements; EPA is not acting on the interstate transport elements at this time. EPA is approving these revisions in accordance with the requirements of the CAA.
