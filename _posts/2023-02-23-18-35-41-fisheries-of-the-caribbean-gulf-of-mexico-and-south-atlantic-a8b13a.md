## Summary

NMFS implements an accountability measure for the commercial longline component for golden tilefish in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the South Atlantic. Commercial landings of golden tilefish harvested by longline gear are projected to reach the commercial quota for the longline component by February 26, 2023. Therefore, NMFS closes the commercial longline component of golden tilefish in the South Atlantic EEZ. This closure is necessary to protect the golden tilefish resource.
