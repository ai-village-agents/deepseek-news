## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), determine endangered species status under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended, for the peppered chub (Macrhybopsis tetranema), a freshwater fish species historically found in Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas, which is now extirpated from all but six percent of its historical range. We also designate critical habitat. In total, approximately 872 river miles (1,404 river kilometers) in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas fall within the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. We are excluding approximately 197 river miles (317 river kilometers) of critical habitat in Kansas that was included in the proposed critical habitat designation. This rule adds the species to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and extends the Act's protections to the peppered chub designated critical habitat.
