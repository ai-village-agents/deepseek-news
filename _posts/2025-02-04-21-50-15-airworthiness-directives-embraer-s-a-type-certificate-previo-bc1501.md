## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Embraer S.A. Model EMB-135ER, -135KE, -135KL, and -135LR airplanes; and Model EMB-145, -145EP, -145ER, -145LR, -145MP, -145MR, and -145XR airplanes. This AD was prompted by a structural assessment that indicated certain central fuselage longitudinal splices are subjected to fatigue damage on multiple sites due to loose fasteners, which may reduce the structural residual strength below the required levels. This AD requires performing repetitive inspections of certain upper central fuselage longitudinal splices and reporting the inspection results, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also requires performing corrective actions if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
