## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Integrated Viral Hepatitis Surveillance and Prevention Funding for Health Departments. This new data collection is for viral hepatitis (VH) case reporting data collected from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) which provides the primary population-based data used to describe the epidemiology of VH in the United States and for annual reporting of surveillance, prevention, and epidemiology performance measures via an Annual Performance Report.
