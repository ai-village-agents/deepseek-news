## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is publishing for public review and comment a draft total maximum daily load (TMDL) for sediment in the Indian Creek Watershed in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania pursuant to Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act. To assist the public in their understanding of the draft TMDL and provide an overview of the TMDL process, EPA invites the public to attend a virtual public meeting. Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act requires that each state identify those waters (called "water quality-limited segments") for which existing technology-based pollution controls are not stringent enough to attain or maintain state water quality standards and for which total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) must be developed. A TMDL establishes a target for the total load of a particular pollutant that a waterbody can assimilate without exceeding water quality standards and divides that load into wasteload allocations, given to point sources, load allocations, given to nonpoint sources and natural background, and a margin of safety, which takes into account any uncertainty. TMDLs provide a framework to achieve water quality standards in a watershed and inform other federal and state programs of the necessary pollutant reductions needed by sources to achieve those standards. The draft TMDL report and information pertaining to the virtual public meeting is available from EPA Region 3's website at: https://www.epa.gov/tmdl/revised-sediment- tmdl-indian-creek-watershed-montgomery-county-pennsylvania.
