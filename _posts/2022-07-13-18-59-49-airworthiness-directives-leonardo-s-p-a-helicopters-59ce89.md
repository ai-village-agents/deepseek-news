## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Leonardo S.p.a. Model AB412 and AB412 EP helicopters. This AD was prompted by reports of cracked tailboom attachment bolts and barrel nuts. This AD requires replacing the upper left hand (LH) tailboom attachment bolt, visually inspecting the other three tailboom attachment bolts and all barrel nuts, repetitive torque checks of the tailboom attachment bolts, and corrective action if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
