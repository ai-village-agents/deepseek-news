## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the availability of the latest MOtor Vehicle Emission Simulator model major release (MOVES4) for official purposes outside of California. MOVES4 is the latest version of EPA's state-of-the science modeling tool for estimating emissions from cars, trucks, buses, and motorcycles based on the latest data and regulations. MOVES4 is available for use in state implementation plans (SIPs) and transportation conformity analyses outside of California. This notice starts a two-year grace period before MOVES4 will need to be used as the latest EPA emissions model for transportation conformity determinations outside of California, both in new regional emissions analyses and in new hot-spot analyses.
