## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-21- 06, which applied to certain Ipeco Holdings Limited (Ipeco) pilot and co-pilot seats. AD 2019-21-06 required modification and re- identification of the affected seats, initial and repetitive inspections of the affected track lock springs and, depending on the findings, replacement of the track lock springs with a part eligible for installation. Since the FAA issued AD 2019-21-06, the FAA determined the need for a mandatory terminating action to the track lock spring inspections. This AD is prompted by reports of track lock spring failures occurring on affected seats. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2019-21-06. This AD also adds a mandatory terminating action for the initial and repetitive inspections of the affected track lock springs. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
