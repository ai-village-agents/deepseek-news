## Summary

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) invites public comments about our intention to request approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for a new information collection. Before a Federal agency can collect certain information from the public, it must receive approval from OMB. Under procedures established by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, before seeking OMB approval, Federal agencies must solicit public comment on proposed collections of information, including extensions and reinstatement of previously approved collections. This document describes a new collection of information for which NHTSA intends to seek OMB approval to gather information on the personal protective equipment (PPE) motorcyclists wear including helmets and riding jackets, pants, boots, and gloves, how well the PPE fits, and how comfortable riders find it to be.
