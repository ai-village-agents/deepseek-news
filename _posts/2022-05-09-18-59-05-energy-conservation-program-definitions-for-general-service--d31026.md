## Summary

On January 19, 2017, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") published two final rules adopting revised definitions of general service lamp ("GSL") and general service incandescent lamp ("GSIL"), and other supplemental definitions, to go into effect January 1, 2020. ("January 2017 Final Rules"). Prior to that effective date, on September 5, 2019, DOE withdrew the revised definitions of GSL, GSIL, and the other supplemental definitions. Upon further review and consideration, on August 19, 2021, DOE published a notice of proposed rulemaking ("NOPR") proposing to amend the definitions of GSL, GSIL and the other supplemental definitions as previously set forth in the January 2017 Final Rules. DOE responds to comments received on the NOPR in this final rule and adopts the definitions of GSL and GSIL and the associated supplemental definitions set forth in the January 2017 Final Rules as proposed in the NOPR.
