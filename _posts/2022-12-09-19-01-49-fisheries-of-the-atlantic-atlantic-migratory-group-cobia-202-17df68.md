## Summary

NMFS implements a closure in Federal waters off Georgia through New York for Atlantic migratory group cobia (Atlantic cobia) that are harvested and sold (commercial). Commercial landings of Atlantic cobia are projected to reach the commercial quota on December 16, 2022. Therefore, NMFS closes the commercial sector for Atlantic cobia in Federal waters from December 16, 2022, until the start of the next fishing year on January 1, 2023. This closure is necessary to protect the Atlantic cobia resource.
