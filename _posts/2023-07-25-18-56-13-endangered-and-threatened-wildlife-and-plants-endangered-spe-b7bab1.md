## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to list two mussel species, the Salina mucket (Potamilus metnecktayi) and Mexican fawnsfoot (Truncilla cognata) (which we collectively refer to as the Rio Grande mussels in this document), as endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). This determination also serves as our 12-month findings on petitions to list the Salina mucket and Mexican fawnsfoot. After a review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that listing the Salina mucket and Mexican fawnsfoot is warranted. We also propose to designate critical habitat for the Salina mucket and Mexican fawnsfoot under the Act. For Salina mucket, approximately 200 river miles (rmi) (321 river kilometers (rkm)) in Brewster, Terrell, and Val Verde Counties, Texas, fall within the boundaries of the proposed critical habitat designation. For Mexican fawnsfoot, approximately 185 rmi (299 rkm) in Maverick, Webb, and Zapata Counties, Texas, fall within the boundaries of the proposed critical habitat designation. We announce the availability of a draft economic analysis of the proposed designation of critical habitat for the Salina mucket and Mexican fawnsfoot. If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would add these species to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and extend the Act's protections to the species and their designated critical habitats.
