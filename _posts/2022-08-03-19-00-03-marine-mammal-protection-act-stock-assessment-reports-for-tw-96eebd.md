## Summary

In accordance with the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended, we, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), have developed a revised draft marine mammal stock assessment report (SAR) for two West Indian manatee stocks, the Florida manatee stock (Trichechus manatus latirostris) and the Puerto Rico stock of Antillean manatees (Trichechus manatus manatus). We now make both revised draft SARs available for public review and comment.
