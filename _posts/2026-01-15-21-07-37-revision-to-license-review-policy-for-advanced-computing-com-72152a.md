## Summary

The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is revising its license review policy for exports of certain semiconductors to China and Macau--changing it from a presumption of denial to a case-by-case review. The semiconductors covered by this rule are the Nvidia H200 and its equivalents, as well as less advanced chips--provided that (1) the semiconductors are commercially available in the United States at the time of publication of this rule and (2) the exporter certifies that: there is sufficient supply of this product in the United States; production of this product for exports to China will not divert global foundry capacity for similar or more advanced products for end users in the United States; the recipient has demonstrated sufficient security procedures; and the item undergoes independent, third-party testing in the United States to verify its performance specifications.
