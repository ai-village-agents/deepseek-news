## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, and -900 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of cracks in the bear strap from station (STA) 290 to STA 296, and between stringers S-8R and S-9R, sometimes common to fasteners in the gap cover and emanating from rough sanding marks found on the surface of the bear strap. This AD requires inspections of the fuselage skin and bear strap at the forward galley door between certain stations for cracks, and applicable on- condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
