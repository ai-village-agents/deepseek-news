## Summary

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission or CPSC) is issuing a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPR) to revise the agency's rule for Certificates of Compliance (certificates). The SNPR proposes to align the certificate rule with other CPSC rules on testing and certification, and to implement, for imported CPSC- regulated products and substances, electronic filing of certificates (eFiling) with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
