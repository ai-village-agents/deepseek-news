## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing that a virtual public hearing will be held for the proposed action titled, "Review of the Secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Oxides of Nitrogen, Oxides of Sulfur, and Particulate Matter" which is published elsewhere in this Federal Register. The hearing will be held on May 8, 2024. Based on the EPA's review of the ecological air quality criteria and the secondary national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for oxides of nitrogen (N oxides), oxides of sulfur (SO<INF>X</INF>), and particulate matter (PM), the EPA is proposing to revise the existing secondary SO<INF>2</INF> standard. Additionally, the Agency proposes to retain the existing secondary standards for N oxides and PM. The EPA also proposes revisions to data handling requirements for the proposed secondary SO<INF>2</INF> standard.
