## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Transportation (DOT), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), proposes to establish a new system of records titled, "DOT/FAA 856 Airmen Medical Records." 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 61.23 Medical Certificates: Requirement and Duration specify operations requiring medical certificates. Collectively, for the purposes of this system of records notice, individuals required to obtain medical certificates are referred to as applicants. This Notice covers records maintained for the required airmen medical certification process which is initiated by the airman medical certificate application. In addition to the initial medical records obtained at time of certification, FAA also maintains information on post-certification medical changes including failed drug and substance abuse testing results that could disqualify certificated airmen. Finally, this system of records supports regulatory enforcement activities and other legal actions, such as denial of medical certifications, so records including, but not limited to, pre- decisional notes in airmen medical files, are exempted from certain access and disclosure requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974.
