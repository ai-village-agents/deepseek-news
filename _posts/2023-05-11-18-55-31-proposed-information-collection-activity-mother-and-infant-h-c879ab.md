## Summary

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF), in partnership with the Health Resources and Services Administration, both of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is proposing to collect data as part of the elementary school phase of the Mother and Infant Home Visiting Program Evaluation (MIHOPE). MIHOPE is a longitudinal study of the effects of Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV)-funded home visiting on child and family outcomes. The purpose of the MIHOPE Long-Term Follow-Up, Third grade (MIHOPE-3G) data collection, which will focus on children when they are in approximately third grade, is to assess the long-term effects of MIECHV-funded home visiting on families and children when participating children are in elementary school.
