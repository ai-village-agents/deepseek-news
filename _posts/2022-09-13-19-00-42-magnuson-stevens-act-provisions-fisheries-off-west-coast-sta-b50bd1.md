## Summary

NMFS proposes regulatory amendments that would apply to the Pacific Coast Groundfish Trawl Rationalization Program participants that operate in the non-tribal Pacific whiting fishery. This rulemaking proposes to adjust the primary Pacific whiting season start date for all sectors of the Pacific whiting fishery from May 15 to May 1, remove from regulation the mothership catcher vessel (MSCV) processor obligation deadline of November 30, remove from regulation the Mothership (MS) processor cap of 45 percent, and provide the ability to operate as a Catcher/Processor (CP) and an MS in the same year. This action is necessary to provide MS sector participants with greater operational flexibility by modifying specific regulations that have been identified as potentially contributing to lower attainment of the Pacific whiting allocation compared to the CP and shoreside Pacific whiting sectors. This proposed rule is intended to promote the goals and objectives of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan, and other applicable laws.
