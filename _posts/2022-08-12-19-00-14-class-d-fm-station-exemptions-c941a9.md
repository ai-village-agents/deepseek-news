## Summary

In this document the Media Bureau (Bureau) of the Federal Communications Commission (Commission or FCC) adopts changes to its public inspection file rules to reinstate the text of an explanatory note that was inadvertently deleted from the Code of Federal Regulations. The note clarified that Class D FM stations, or stations whose programming is wholly "Instructional," are exempt from the requirement to maintain issues and programs lists in their public inspection file. Reinstatement of this explanatory text will provide clarity to regulatees as to their public inspection file obligations.
