## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Oral Health Basic Screening Survey for Children. The project provides State-specific data on dental caries (tooth decay) and dental sealants from a State-representative sample of elementary school children or children enrolled in Head Start programs and has been used by States to monitor oral health status of children and evaluate public health programs and policies.
