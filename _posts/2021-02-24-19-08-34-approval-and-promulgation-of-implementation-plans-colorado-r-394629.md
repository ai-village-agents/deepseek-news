## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving and conditionally approving State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of Colorado on May 31, 2017, May 14, 2018 and May 8, 2019. The revisions are to Colorado Air Quality Control Commission (Commission or AQCC) Regulation Number 7 (Reg. 7). The revisions to Reg. 7 address Colorado's reasonably available control technology (RACT) SIP obligations for Moderate 2008 ozone nonattainment areas; add incorporation by reference dates to rules and reference methods; and make typographical, grammatical, and formatting corrections. Also, in this action the EPA is correcting a July 3, 2018 final rule pertaining to Colorado's SIP. In that action, we inadvertently omitted regulatory text corresponding to "incorporation by reference" (IBR) materials for graphic arts and printing revisions to Reg. 7, Section XIII (adopted November 17, 2016). The EPA is taking this action pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA).
