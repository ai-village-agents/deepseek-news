## Summary

NMFS is implementing regulations for Amendment 23 to the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan, which the New England Fishery Management Council adopted and NMFS approved. This action adjusts the existing industry-funded at-sea monitoring program for groundfish sectors to improve the accuracy of collected catch data (landings and discards) and catch accounting. The measures implementing Amendment 23 are intended to ensure there is a precise and accurate representation of catch to set catch limit levels that prevent overfishing and determine when catch limits are exceeded.
