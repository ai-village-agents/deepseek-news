## Summary

The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (Committee, U.S. AbilityOne Commission, Commission), Office of Inspector General (OIG) is seeking comment on proposed amendments to agency regulations. This NPRM proposes that the OIG's AbilityOne/OIG-001 Case Management System, system of records be exempt from certain sections of the Privacy Act of 1974 pursuant to the general and specific exemptions listed in the act. The law enforcement and investigatory nature of the system of records makes it inappropriate to allow individual access to records under the Privacy Act.
