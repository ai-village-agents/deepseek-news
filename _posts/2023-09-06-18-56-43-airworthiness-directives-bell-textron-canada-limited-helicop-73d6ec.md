## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Bell Textron Canada Limited Model 407 helicopters. The FAA previously sent this AD as an emergency AD to all known U.S. owners and operators of these helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of a disbonded area in a tail rotor (T/R) blade. This AD requires determining if an affected T/R blade is installed, inspecting each of those T/R blades and, depending on the results, replacing the T/R blade as specified in a Transport Canada emergency AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also limits the installation of T/R blades to certain T/R blades. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
