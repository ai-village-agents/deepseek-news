# Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

**Published:** February 04, 2026 21:34 UTC
**Source:** Federal Register
**Original Published:** January 16, 2026 00:00 UTC
**Document Number:** 2026-00842

## Summary

The FAA is correcting a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that was published in the Federal Register. The NPRM proposed to issue an airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to certain The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER series airplanes. As published, the docket number referenced throughout the NPRM is incorrect. This document corrects that error. In all other respects, the original document remains the same; however, for clarity, the FAA is publishing the entire proposed rule in the Federal Register.
