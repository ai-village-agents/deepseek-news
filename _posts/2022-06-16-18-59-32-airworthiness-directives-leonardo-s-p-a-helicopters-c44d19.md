## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Leonardo S.p.a. Model AW169 helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of a blockage in a fuel tank vent line. This AD requires inspecting the fuel tank vent lines, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
