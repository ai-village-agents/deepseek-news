## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing reporting and recordkeeping requirements for asbestos under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). EPA proposes to require certain persons that manufactured (including imported) or processed asbestos and asbestos-containing articles (including as an impurity) in the four years prior to the date of publication of the final rule to electronically report certain exposure-related information. This action would result in a one-time reporting obligation. EPA emphasizes that this proposed requirement would include asbestos that is a component of a mixture. The information sought includes quantities of asbestos (including asbestos that is a component of a mixture) and asbestos- containing articles that were manufactured (including imported) or processed, types of use, and employee data. Reported information would be used by EPA and other Federal agencies in considering potential future actions, including risk evaluation and risk management activities. EPA is requesting public comment on all aspects of this proposed rule and has also identified items of particular interest for public input.
