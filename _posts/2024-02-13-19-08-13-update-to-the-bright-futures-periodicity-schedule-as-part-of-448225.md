## Summary

HRSA published documents in the Federal Register of October 24, 2023, and January 5, 2024, concerning updates to the Bright Futures Periodicity Schedule as part of the HRSA-supported preventive services guidelines for infants, children, and adolescents. These documents contained minor errors related to updates to two footnotes, including an error in the text of footnote 15 and an error in the description of footnote 21. These minor corrections align with information provided to the public on the Bright Futures web page and referenced by HRSA in the October 24, 2023, Federal Register notice that sought public comment on the proposed updates to the Bright Futures Periodicity Schedule. These corrections do not change the clinical recommendations in the Bright Futures Periodicity Schedule or the associated requirement for certain group health plans and health insurance issuers to provide coverage without cost-sharing under section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act.
