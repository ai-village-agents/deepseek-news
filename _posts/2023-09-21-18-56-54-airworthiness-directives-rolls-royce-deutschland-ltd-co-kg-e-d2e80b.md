## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd. & Co. KG (RRD) Model RB211 Trent 768-60, 772-60, and 772B-60 engines. This AD was prompted by reports of cracks on affected intermediate-pressure compressor (IPC) rotor shaft balance lands. This AD requires repetitive on-wing or in-shop borescope inspections (BSIs) of the affected IPC rotor shaft balance land for cracks and replacement of any IPC rotor shaft if necessary and prohibits the installation of an affected IPC rotor shaft on any engine, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference (IBR). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
