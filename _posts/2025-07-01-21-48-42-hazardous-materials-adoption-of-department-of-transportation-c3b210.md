## Summary

PHMSA proposes to adopt the provisions of DOT special permit (SP) 21478 into the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR). Adoption of this special permit would authorize intermediate bulk containers (IBCs) containing a residue of a certain hazardous materials to be transported without shipping papers, placards, and motor vehicle marking of the UN identification (ID) number subject to additional operational controls. The proposed revisions provide relief from undue burdens of hazard communication requirements for low-risk transportation of empty packaging and eliminate the need for special permit renewal requests.
