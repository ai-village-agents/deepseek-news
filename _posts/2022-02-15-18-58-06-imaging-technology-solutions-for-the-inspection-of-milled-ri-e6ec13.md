## Summary

The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is inviting manufacturers of automated imaging instrumentation to partner in cooperative research and development efforts to determine broken kernels, whole kernels, and milling yield, in percentage by mass, in short-, medium-, and long- grain milled rice. The goal is to develop a commercially available instrument that can be used in providing official inspection results at AMS field offices and official service provider locations. Manufacturers must be willing to enter into a cooperative research and development agreement that includes mutually agreed upon roles and responsibilities, providing a suitable instrument, and providing technical expertise to facilitate the development of algorithms and/or calibrations. AMS will provide the rice samples and inspection expertise necessary to facilitate method development efforts and assess whether the instrument is fit for the intended purpose.
