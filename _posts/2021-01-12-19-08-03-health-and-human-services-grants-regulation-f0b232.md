This final rule repromulgates and adopts changes to certain provisions in the Department's Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for HHS awards (UAR). This rule repromulgates sections of the UAR dealing with payments, access to records, indirect allowable cost requirements, and a portion of the provision dealing with shared responsibility payments under the Affordable Care Act. This rule also amends sections dealing with national policy requirements to bring them into compliance with the authority under which the UAR is promulgated and OMB guidance, as well as to reflect those nondiscrimination requirements that have been adopted by Congress.
