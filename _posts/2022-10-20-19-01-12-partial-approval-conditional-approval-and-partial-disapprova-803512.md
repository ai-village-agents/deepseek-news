## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve in part, conditionally approve in part, and disapprove in part a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Nevada pursuant to the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act") for the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of the 2012 national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>). As part of this action, we are proposing to reclassify certain regions of the State for emergency episode planning purposes with respect to PM<INF>2.5</INF>. We are also proposing to approve an exemption from emergency episode planning requirements for PM<INF>2.5</INF> for the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) and Washoe County. Finally, we are proposing to approve two new definitions and four regulatory revisions into the Nevada SIP. We are taking comments on this proposal and, after considering any comments submitted, plan to take final action.
