## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-07-13 for certain Pacific Scientific Company rotary buckle assemblies (buckles). AD 2021-07-13 required inspecting each specified buckle including its buckle handle vane and prohibited installing affected buckles. This AD was prompted by the publication of an updated service bulletin, which revises the applicability based on date of manufacture of the affected buckles. This AD retains certain requirements of AD 2021-07-13, reduces the applicability, and requires performing corrective actions by complying with certain portions of the updated service bulletin. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
