## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of Acetic acid ethenyl ester, polymer with ethene, N-(hydroxymethyl)-2-propenamide, and 2-propenamide; (AM-E-NMA- VA) when used as an inert ingredient in a pesticide chemical formulation. Celanese Corporation Ltd., submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of Acetic acid ethenyl ester, polymer with ethene, N- (hydroxymethyl)-2-propenamide, and 2-propenamide (AM-E-NMA-VA) on food or feed commodities.
