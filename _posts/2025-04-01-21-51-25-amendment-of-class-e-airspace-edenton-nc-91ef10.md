## Summary

The FAA is correcting a final rule that appeared in the Federal Register on March 10, 2025. The final rule amended Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface for ECU Health Chowan Hospital Heliport, Edenton, NC, to accommodate new area navigation (RNAV) global positioning system (GPS) standard instrument approach procedures serving the heliport. Additionally, it corrected the Northeastern Regional Airport name along with correcting coordinates for Northeastern Regional Airport. This action corrects that rule by changing the effective date to June 12, 2025.
