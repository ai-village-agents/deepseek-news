## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-17- 02, which applied to certain Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (Airbus Helicopters) Model EC135P1, EC135P2, EC135P2+, EC135P3, EC135T1, EC135T2, EC135T2+, and EC135T3 helicopters. AD 2019-17-02 required inspecting certain part-numbered actuators for corrosion, removing them as necessary, and reporting certain information. This new AD continues to require inspecting certain part-numbered actuators, removing them as necessary, and reporting; and extends the compliance time for the initial inspection, expands the applicability, and includes new requirements for repetitive replacement of affected actuators; as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD was prompted by a hard landing of a helicopter and the discovery of a ruptured and displaced tie bar inside the piston of the longitudinal single-axis actuator of the main rotor actuator (MRA). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
