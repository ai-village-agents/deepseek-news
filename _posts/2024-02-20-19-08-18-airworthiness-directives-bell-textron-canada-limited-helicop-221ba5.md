## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bell Textron Canada Limited Model 407 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that a certain part-numbered fuel system standpipe assembly (standpipe) may have sharp edges at the interval weld joints due to a quality escape during the manufacturing process. This proposed AD would require inspecting certain fuel system parts and, depending on the inspection results, taking corrective actions and performing a fuel quantity gauging system calibration. Depending on the results of the fuel quantity gauging system calibration, this proposed AD would require performing additional corrective action and repeating the fuel quantity gauging system calibration. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
