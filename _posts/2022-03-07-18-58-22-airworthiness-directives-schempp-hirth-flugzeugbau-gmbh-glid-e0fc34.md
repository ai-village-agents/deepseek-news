## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Schempp-Hirth Flugzeugbau GmbH Model Ventus-2a and Ventus-2b gliders. This AD was prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI describes the unsafe condition as severe corrosion on the inboard flaperon actuation push rods and ball bearing connecting the flaperon push rod to the bell crank inside the wing. This AD requires inspecting the affected parts of the flaperon control in the wings and taking corrective actions if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
