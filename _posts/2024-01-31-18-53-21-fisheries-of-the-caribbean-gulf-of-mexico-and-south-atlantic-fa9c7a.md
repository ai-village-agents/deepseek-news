## Summary

NMFS proposes to implement management measures described in Framework Amendment 2 to the Fishery Management Plans for Puerto Rico, St. Croix, and St. Thomas and St. John (collectively, the island-based FMPs). If implemented, this proposed rule would modify annual catch limits (ACLs) for spiny lobster in the U.S. Caribbean exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off Puerto Rico, St. Croix, and St. Thomas and St. John. The purpose of this proposed rule is to update management reference points for spiny lobster, consistent with the best scientific information available to prevent overfishing and achieve optimum yield (OY).
