## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Fokker Services B.V. Model F28 Mark 0100 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of smoke in the flight deck, in conjunction with the loss of electrical power. This AD requires replacement of affected generator power transfer contactors (GPTCs), essential bus transfer contactors (EBTCs), and auxiliary power transfer contactors (APTCs), as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
