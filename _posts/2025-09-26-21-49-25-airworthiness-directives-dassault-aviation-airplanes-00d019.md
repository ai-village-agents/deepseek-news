# Airworthiness Directives; Dassault Aviation Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Dassault Aviation Model FALCON 2000EX airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of simultaneous failures of the main DC buses powered by Generator 1 (GEN1), and Generator 2 (GEN2) after flap extension during approach. This proposed AD would require revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
