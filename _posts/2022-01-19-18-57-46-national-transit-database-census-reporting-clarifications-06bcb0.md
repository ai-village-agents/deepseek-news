## Summary

This notice provides interested parties with the opportunity to comment on changes to the Federal Transit Administration's (FTA) National Transit Database (NTD) reporting requirements as they relate to Urbanized Areas (UZA). Each year, transit systems use data from the Census Bureau to update their basic information (B-10) form indicating what urbanized areas and rural areas they serve, and also to complete their Federal Funding Allocation (FFA-10) form distributing their service data across those urbanized and rural areas. The Census Bureau is expected to define new UZAs based on 2020 Census data in calendar year 2022. FTA proposes that for NTD Report Year 2021 (RY 2021), transit systems would be required to complete a B-10 and FFA-10 form based on the UZAs from the 2010 Census, as usual. If the Census Bureau releases new UZAs prior to October 1, 2022, then transit systems would be required to complete new B-10 and FFA-10 forms as an addendum to the annual report at that time.
