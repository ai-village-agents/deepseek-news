## Summary

The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) within the Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education invites the general public and other federal agencies to comment on a proposed information collection. NCES plans to collect information from individuals to fulfill its data security requirements when providing access to restricted-use microdata for the purpose of evidence building. NCES's data security agreements and other paperwork along with the corresponding security protocols allow the agency to maintain careful controls on confidentiality and privacy, as required by law. NCES published this proposal for 60 days of public comment beginning November 25, 2022. The purpose of this notice is to allow for an additional 30 days of public comment on the proposed data security information collection, prior to submission of the information collection request (ICR) to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
