## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC" or "Commission") is adopting amendments to the Commission's rules implementing its whistleblower program. Section 21F of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and the Commission's implementing rules provide that the Commission shall pay an award to eligible whistleblowers who voluntarily provide the Commission with original information about a violation of the federal securities laws that leads to the successful enforcement of a covered judicial or administrative action or a non-SEC related action. The amendments: expand the scope of related actions eligible for an award under the Commission's whistleblower program; clarify that the Commission may use its statutory authority under Section 21F to consider the dollar amount of a potential award to increase an award but provide that the Commission will not use any statutory authority it might have to decrease the amount of an award; and make several conforming changes and technical corrections.
