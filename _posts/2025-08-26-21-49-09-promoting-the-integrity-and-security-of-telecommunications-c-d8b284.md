## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (Commission) is correcting a final rule that appeared in the Federal Register on August 7, 2025. The document addressed requirements for all recognized telecommunication certification bodies (TCBs), test labs, and laboratory accreditation bodies to certify to the Commission that they are not owned by, controlled by, or subject to the direction of a prohibited entity and to report all equity or voting interests of 5% or greater by any entity. The document inadvertently included compliance dates for provisions that are delayed indefinitely and excluded a word in one section.
