## Summary

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to establish the 70,437-acre "Conneaut Creek" American viticultural area (AVA) in Ashtabula County, Ohio. The proposed AVA is located entirely within the boundaries of the existing Lake Erie AVA. TTB designates viticultural areas to allow vintners to better describe the origin of their wines and to allow consumers to better identify wines they may purchase. TTB invites comments on these proposals.
