# Methoxyfenozide; Pesticide Tolerances; Correction

## Summary

EPA issued a final rule in the Federal Register of October 11, 2022, establishing tolerances for residues of methoxyfenozide in or on multiple commodities requested by the Interregional Research Project Number 4 (IR-4) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). That document inadvertently omitted an instruction to add a tolerance for the commodity "bean, mung, dry seed". This document corrects the final regulation.
