## Summary

The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is making technical revisions to its regulation governing the Federal Home Loan Banks' (Banks) Affordable Housing Program (AHP) and to related provisions in the Community Support Requirements regulation, which were both amended by a final rule published on November 28, 2018. These technical revisions are consistent with FHFA's policy intent, as reflected in the preamble discussions of the 2018 final rule, and do not involve any policy changes.
