The safety zone would protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards during multi-agency helicopter rescue demonstration. It would be enforced thirty minutes prior to a demonstration and lifted at its conclusion. Entry of vessels or persons into this zone is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port, Maryland-National Capital Region, or a designated representative.
