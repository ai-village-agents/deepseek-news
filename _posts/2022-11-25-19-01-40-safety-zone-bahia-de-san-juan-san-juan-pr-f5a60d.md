## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for navigable waters of Bahia de San Juan, within a 200-yard radius of the tug MICHELE FOSS and barge FOSS PREVAILING WIND. The safety zone is needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards created by the movement and berthing of two port facility cranes transiting inbound to Puerto Rico Ports Authority (PRPA) piers M, N and O, through Bahia de San Juan's main navigational channels. Entry of vessels or persons into this zone is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port Sector San Juan.
