## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-2B19 (Regional Jet Series 100 & 440) airplanes, Model CL-600-2C10 (Regional Jet Series 700, 701 & 702) airplanes, Model CL-600-2D15 (Regional Jet Series 705) airplanes, and Model CL-600-2D24 (Regional Jet Series 900) airplanes; and all Model CL-600-2C11 (Regional Jet Series 550) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of fractured rudder primary feel unit shafts; a subsequent investigation determined that the fractures in the shafts are consistent with fatigue damage. This proposed AD would require replacement of the rudder primary feel unit shaft. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
