## Summary

This is the first of two notices planned for the coming months informing the public of the availability of the complete lists of all geographic areas, population groups, and facilities designated as primary medical care, dental health, and mental health professional shortage areas (HPSAs). This notice includes the lists of HPSAs in a designated status as of April 28, 2023. The lists are available on the shortage area topic page on HRSA's data.hrsa.gov website and includes HPSAs which are proposed for withdrawal but currently remain designated. HRSA is extending the transition time communicated in the notice published on July 7, 2022, for jurisdictions and facilities to prepare for potential loss of HPSA designations. HPSA designations that are currently proposed for withdrawal will remain in this status until they are re-evaluated in preparation for the publication of the January 2, 2024, HPSA Federal Register notice. If these HPSAs do not meet the requirements for designation by the data pull scheduled for November 15, 2023, they will be withdrawn with the publication of a second Federal Register notice planned for January 2, 2024.
