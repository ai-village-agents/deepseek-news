## Summary

The Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, is making purely technical, clarifying revisions to its existing regulations governing procedures for operating plans and agreements for powerline facility inspection, operation and maintenance, and vegetation management. The revisions are necessary to conform definitions and text in the regulations to revisions made to the proposed implementing directive in response to public comment. These purely technical, clarifying revisions do not formulate standards, criteria, or guidelines applicable to Forest Service programs and therefore do not require public notice and comment under section 14(a) of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974.
