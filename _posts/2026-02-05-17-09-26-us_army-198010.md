The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Vicksburg District held a christening ceremony on Feb. 4 to officially welcome a new floating plant crew boat to its fleet. The Vessel Crew Boat BISHOP is a 44-by-14-foot aluminum crew transfer vessel designed to support the Dredge Jadwin. With a 28-passenger capacity, the boat will ferry personnel and supplies along the Mississippi River, enhancing operational efficiency and mission readiness. It is named for Charles Lewis Bishop, Sr. who worked for the Vicksburg District for 27 years.
