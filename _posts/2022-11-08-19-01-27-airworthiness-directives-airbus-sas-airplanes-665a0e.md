## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-06- 07, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A330-200 series and A330- 300 series airplanes. AD 2021-06-07 required repetitive detailed inspections of the courier area oxygen system (CAOS) and replacement of affected parts if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-06-07, improved flexible oxygen hoses have been developed. This AD continues to require repetitive detailed inspections of the CAOS and replacement of affected parts if necessary. This AD also requires replacing each affected part with an improved serviceable part, which is terminating action for the repetitive inspections. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
