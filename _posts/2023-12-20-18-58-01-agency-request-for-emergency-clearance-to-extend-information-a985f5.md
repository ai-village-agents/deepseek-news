## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice announces DOT's intention to seek emergency clearance to extend the information collection request (ICR) under Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Control Number 2105-0576, "U.S. Department of Transportation Service Animal Air Transportation Form" and "U.S. Department of Transportation Service Animal Relief Attestation Form." We are seeking emergency clearance to temporarily extend the ICR to ensure that airlines may continue to collect service animal forms from passengers with disabilities, which provide assurances to the airline that the service animal does not pose a safety threat to passengers and crew onboard aircraft. DOT requests that OMB approve this extension request within 7 days.
