## Summary

This action finalizes the Department of Labor's (Department) proposal to further extend the effective date of three discrete portions of the rule titled Tip Regulations Under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) (2020 Tip final rule), published December 30, 2020. This further delay of three portions of the rule allows the Department to complete a separate rulemaking that proposes to withdraw and re-propose two of these portions of the 2020 Tip final rule, published March 25, 2021, which includes, inter alia, a 60-day comment period and at least a 30-day delay between publication and the rule's effective date. It will also provide the Department additional time to conduct another rulemaking to potentially revise that portion of the 2020 Tip final rule addressing the application of the FLSA's tip credit provision to tipped employees who perform both tipped and non-tipped duties. All of the remaining portions of the 2020 Tip final rule will go into effect on April 30, 2021.
