## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to find that the Manitowoc, Wisconsin area is attaining the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS or standard) and to act in accordance with a request from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) to redesignate the area to attainment for the 2015 ozone NAAQS, because the request meets the statutory requirements for redesignation under the Clean Air Act (CAA). Also, EPA is proposing to approve WDNR's certification that its stationary annual emissions statement regulation, which has been previously approved by EPA under a prior ozone standard, satisfies the CAA emission statement rule requirement for the 2015 ozone standard. WDNR submitted these requests on August 3, 2020 and October 29, 2021. EPA is also proposing to approve, as a revision to the Wisconsin State Implementation Plan (SIP), the State's plan for maintaining the 2015 ozone NAAQS through 2033 in the Manitowoc area. EPA also finds adequate and is proposing to approve Wisconsin's 2025 and 2033 volatile organic compound (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) Motor Vehicle Emission Budgets (MVEBs) for the Manitowoc area. Finally, these revisions satisfy the emissions inventory requirements for the partial Manitowoc area under the 2015 ozone NAAQS. The CAA requires emission inventories for all areas that were designated nonattainment.
