## Summary

The Secretary establishes new regulations governing the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program to establish a new Federal standard and a process for determining whether a borrower has a defense to repayment on a loan based on an act or omission of their school. We also are amending the Direct Loan Program regulations to prohibit participating schools from using certain contractual provisions regarding dispute resolution processes and to require certain notifications and disclosures by institutions (institutions or schools) regarding their use of mandatory arbitration. Additionally, we are amending the Direct Loan regulations to eliminate interest capitalization in instances where it is not required by statute. We are also amending the regulations governing closed school discharges and total and permanent disability (TPD) discharges in the Federal Perkins Loan (Perkins), Direct Loan, and Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) programs. We are also amending the regulations governing false certification discharges in the Direct Loan and FFEL programs. Finally, we are amending the regulations governing Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) in the Direct Loan program to improve the application process, and to clarify and expand definitions for full- time employment, qualifying employers, and qualifying monthly payments. The changes would bring greater transparency and clarity and improve the administration of Federal student financial aid programs to assist and protect students, participating institutions, and taxpayers.
