## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for the Ohio River several days in November and December 2023, and January 2024, at mile marker 2.5 to mile marker 3 from 8 a.m. through 6 p.m. each day. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on the navigable waters during a helicopter operation to install aerial transverse wirelines. This rule prohibits persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Pittsburgh (COTP) or a designated representative.
