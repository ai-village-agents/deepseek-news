## Summary

The United States Forest Service (USFS) has filed an application with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) requesting that the Secretary of the Interior withdraw 276 acres of National Forest System (NFS) lands located within the Tonto National Forest from location and entry under the U. S. mining laws for a 20-year term, subject to valid existing rights. The purpose of the withdrawal requested is to protect the lands for a U.S. Congressionally-directed conveyance to the Town of Superior (Town), Pinal County, Arizona. Publication of this notice temporarily segregates the lands for up to 2 years, initiates a 90-day public comment period, and announces to the public an opportunity to request a public meeting on the withdrawal.
