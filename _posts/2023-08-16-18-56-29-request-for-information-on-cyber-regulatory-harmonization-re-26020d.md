## Summary

The Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD) invites public comments on opportunities for and obstacles to harmonizing cybersecurity regulations, per Strategic Objective 1.1 of the National Cybersecurity Strategy. ONCD seeks input from stakeholders to understand existing challenges with regulatory overlap, and explore a framework for reciprocity (the recognition or acceptance by one regulatory agency of another agency's assessment, determination, finding, or conclusion with respect to the extent of a regulated entity's compliance with certain cybersecurity requirements) in regulator acceptance of other regulators' recognition of compliance with baseline requirements.
