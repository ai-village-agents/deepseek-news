## Summary

Pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965, as amended (commonly known as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking direct final action to approve revisions to the State of Minnesota's Underground Storage Tank (UST) program submitted by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. This action also codifies EPA's approval of Minnesota's state program and incorporates by reference those provisions of Minnesota's statutes and regulations that EPA has determined meet the requirements for approval. The provisions will be subject to EPA's inspection and enforcement authorities under RCRA Subtitle I and other applicable statutory and regulatory provisions.
