## Summary

This notice announces that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD, the Department) has conducted an initial review required by the Build America, Buy America Act (the Act) to identify and evaluate its Federal financial assistance programs for infrastructure to determine whether they are inconsistent with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (the IIJA). The Act imposes domestic content procurement preference requirements on Federal financial assistance programs for infrastructure that do not currently have such a requirement and requires Federal agencies to evaluate each financial assistance program for infrastructure administered by the agency to identify programs inconsistent with the Act's requirements for application of a domestic procurement preference. Each Federal agency must submit its report on the agency's programs and related determinations to Congress and to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and publish its report in the Federal Register. Today's notice complies with the Act's publication and reporting requirements and contains HUD's list of identified Federal financial assistance programs for infrastructure. HUD has determined that none of the programs it has reviewed to date are consistent with the Act. HUD's initial analysis errs on the side of over-inclusiveness based on the Department's current understanding of information contained in the Act and the imminent timing requirements for reporting.
