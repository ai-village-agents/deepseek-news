## Summary

The Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is soliciting proposals from eligible Tribal Organizations to participate in a demonstration project to purchase agricultural commodities for the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR). This demonstration project is authorized under the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018. Response to this solicitation is available to Tribal Organizations that administer FDPIR and have not previously been awarded a contract. Tribal Organizations will be selected on a competitive basis and funding will be awarded through a self-determination contract. This is the second solicitation of proposals for participation in the demonstration project. USDA issued a first solicitation of proposals and awarded a first round of self-determination contracts for participation in the demonstration project in FY 2021.
