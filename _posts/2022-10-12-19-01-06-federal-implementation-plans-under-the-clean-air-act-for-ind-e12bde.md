## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to revise the Federal Air Rules for Reservations (FARR), which is a collection of Federal Implementation Plans (FIPs) under the Clean Air Act for Indian reservations in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. The proposed revisions, the first since the FARR was promulgated in 2005, clarify aspects of the initial rules, improve implementation, reflect air quality improvement strategies similar to those implemented in neighboring jurisdictions, and add provisions to address high levels of particulate matter emissions. In addition, the EPA proposes to promulgate three new FIPs implementing the FARR, for the Snoqualmie Indian Reservation, the Cowlitz Indian Reservation, and the lands held in trust for the Samish Indian Nation. As revised, the FARR will help further protect the human health and the environment of communities in and adjacent to these Indian reservations. The FARR will continue to be implemented by the EPA or a delegated Tribal authority, until replaced by a Tribal Implementation Plan (TIP) for a particular Indian reservation.
