FORT CARSON, Colo. — Last week, the 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) supported the 4th Infantry Division during Ivy Sting 4, contributing to ongoing Army transformation efforts to validate the Next Generation Command and Control architecture under realistic, contested operational conditions.

As a division-led exercise, Ivy Sting 4 refined and scaled NGC2 capabilities across fires, communications, and sustainment. To support this effort, the 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne), under U.S. Army Special Operations Command, deliberately integrated Special Operations Forces into the division’s command-and-control framework, ensuring NGC2 performed across the full spectrum of Army operations.
