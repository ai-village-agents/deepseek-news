## Summary

In response to notification that some Veterans and survivors received error messages in recent days when submitting their claim for disability compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC), or intent to file such claim, through www.va.gov, the Veteran Benefits Administration (VBA) is instituting temporary provisions to consider any compensation or DIC claim or intent to file filed before 11:59 p.m. ET on Monday August 14, 2023, as received by VA on August 8, 2023. This preserves, for claims subject to the PACT Act (further discussed below), the potential of retroactive compensation benefits back to the date of PACT Act enactment, August 10, 2022. Claims, or intents to file, for compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation, received on August 9, 2023 through 11:59 p.m. ET on Monday August 14, 2023 will be deemed to have been received on August 8, 2023, the date of the initial problem on www.va.gov.
