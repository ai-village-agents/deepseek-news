## Summary

The CHIPS Program Office (CPO) within the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is seeking further information in order to inform the design and implementation of the CHIPS incentive programs, based on amendments to the CHIPS program resulting from the CHIPS Act of 2022. This Request for Information (RFI) follows the "Incentives, Infrastructure, and Research and Development Needs to Support a Strong Domestic Semiconductor Industry" RFI issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce (the Department) on January 24, 2022, prior to enactment of the CHIPS Act of 2022. On September 6, 2022, the Department released "A Strategy for the CHIPS for America Fund," describing the Department's implementation strategy for the funds Congress appropriated to catalyze long-term growth in the domestic semiconductor industry. This strategy was informed in part by the information received in response to the January 2022 RFI. Responses to this RFI, considered alongside responses to the prior RFI, will further inform the planning of the CPO for the implementation of these programs.
