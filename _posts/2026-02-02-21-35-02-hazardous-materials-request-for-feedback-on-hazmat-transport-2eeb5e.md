## Summary

The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) seeks public input on the safety risks, operational challenges, and regulatory considerations associated with transporting hazardous materials (hazmat) using heavy-duty electric vehicles (EVs) compared to internal combustion engine (ICE) motor carriers (i.e., gas or diesel). PHMSA aims to understand what impact the transition from ICE to EV motor carriers may have on hazmat packaging integrity, transportation safety, emergency response protocols, regulatory compliance, and overall vehicle risk. PHMSA may use the information gathered to develop a statement of work for further research into the safety of transporting hazardous materials in EVs.
