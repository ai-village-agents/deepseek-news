## Summary

Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on December 16, 2020, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of Ventria Bioscience Inc. of Junction City, Kansas. Supplements to the complaint were filed on December 16, and 22, 2020. The complaint, as supplemented, alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain plant- derived recombinant human serum albumins ("rHSA") and products containing same by reason of infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 10,618,951 ("the '951 patent"); and U.S. Patent No. 8,609,416 ("the '416 patent"). The complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The complaint also alleges violations of section 337 based on the importation into the United States, or in the sale of, certain plant-derived recombinant human serum albumins ("rHSA") and products containing same by reason of false designation of origin, the threat or effect of which is to destroy or substantially injure an industry in the United States. The complainant requests that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a limited exclusion order and cease and desist orders.
