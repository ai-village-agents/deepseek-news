## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) permanently debarring Willis Reed from providing services in any capacity to a person that has an approved or pending drug product application. FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Reed was convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct that relates to the regulation of a drug product under the FD&C Act. Mr. Reed was given notice of the proposed debarment and an opportunity to request a hearing within the timeframe prescribed by regulation. As of February 10, 2024 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Mr. Reed has not responded. Mr. Reed's failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this matter.
