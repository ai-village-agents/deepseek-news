## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is expanding the period of review (POR) for the current antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) administrative reviews of certain quartz surface products (quartz surface products) from the People's Republic of China (China) to include entries suspended by the final scope ruling on Malaysian processed quartz slab prior to the current POR of the instant reviews. Additionally, Commerce is providing a supplemental opportunity for interested parties to request a review of certain companies currently ineligible for the scope certification process with suspended entries during the expanded POR solely for the purposes of examining their certification status.
