## Summary

On January 4, 2021, the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) sustained the Department of Commerce's (Commerce's) second remand results pertaining to the first administrative review of the antidumping duty order on welded line pipe (WLP) from the Republic of Korea (Korea) covering the period of review (POR) of May 22, 2015 through November 30, 2016. Commerce is notifying the public that the CIT's final judgment in this case is not in harmony with Commerce's amended final results in the first administrative review of WLP from Korea. Consistent with the CIT's final judgment, Commerce is amending the weighted-average dumping margins calculated for Hyundai Steel Company/Hyundai HYSCO (Hyundai Steel), SeAH Steel Corporation (SeAH), and the 22 non-selected companies
