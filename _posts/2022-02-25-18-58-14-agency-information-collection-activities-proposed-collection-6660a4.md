## Summary

The Federal Emergency Management Agency, as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, invites the general public to take this opportunity to comment on a revision of a currently approved information collection. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice seeks comments regarding the requirements, grants management procedures, and implementation of grants awarded under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), which is a post-disaster program that contributes funds toward the cost of hazard mitigation activities in order to reduce the risk of future damage, hardship, loss or suffering in any area affected by a major disaster.
