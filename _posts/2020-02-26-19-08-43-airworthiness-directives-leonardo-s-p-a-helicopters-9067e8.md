## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Leonardo S.p.A. Model AW189 helicopters. This AD requires inspecting the hydraulic fluid level on each tail rotor (T/R) damper and depending on the inspection results, removing the T/R damper from service and reporting information or repetitively inspecting the T/R damper. This AD is prompted by reports of major leakage of hydraulic fluid in T/R dampers. This condition could result in degradation of T/R damper performance; multiple leaking T/R dampers could result in T/R damage and subsequent loss control of the helicopter. The actions of this AD are intended to address an unsafe condition on these products.
