## Summary

As part of its Provider of Choice effort, BPA is publishing a draft policy that describes the agency's long-term power sales marketing approach for the period following the expiration of existing long-term power sales contracts on September 30, 2028. The draft policy describes the agency's products and service offerings for this next contract period and how the agency proposes to distribute the costs and benefits from its system of federal resources, which includes the Federal Columbia River Power System, the Columbia Generating Station, as well as non-federal resources and short-term purchases of power power from the spot market. BPA expects to release the final policy and record of decision in early calendar year 2024, once all public comments have been reviewed. Following finalization of the policy, BPA will undertake a follow-on process to implement the policy through negotiation and development of contracts with the goal to offer and execute new long-term contracts by late 2025. Bonneville will use the time between contract signing and the start of power deliveries on October 1, 2028, to ready systems to ensure a smooth transition between contracts.
