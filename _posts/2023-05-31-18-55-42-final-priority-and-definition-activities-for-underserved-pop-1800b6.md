## Summary

The U.S. Department of Education (Department) announces a priority and definition under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (Rehabilitation Act), for Activities for Underserved Populations program, Assistance Listing Number (ALN) 84.315C. We take this action to improve the delivery of vocational rehabilitation services to, and the employment outcomes of, individuals with disabilities from underserved populations. For this priority, we define "underserved populations" to mean "Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and other persons of color." The Department may use this priority and definition for competitions in fiscal year (FY) 2023 and later years.
