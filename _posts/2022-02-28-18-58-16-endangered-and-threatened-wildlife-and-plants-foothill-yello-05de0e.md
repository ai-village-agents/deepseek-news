## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are extending the comment period on our December 28, 2021, proposed rule to list four distinct population segments (DPSs) of the foothill yellow- legged frog (Rana boylii), a stream-dwelling amphibian from Oregon and California, under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). We are extending the proposed rule's comment period for 30 days to give all interested parties an additional opportunity to comment. Comments previously submitted need not be resubmitted as they are already incorporated into the public record and will be fully considered in the final rule.
