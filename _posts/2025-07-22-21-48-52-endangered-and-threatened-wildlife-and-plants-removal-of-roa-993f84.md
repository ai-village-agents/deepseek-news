## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are removing the Roanoke logperch (Percina rex), a freshwater fish in the perch family (Percidae), from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. After a review of the best scientific and commercial data available, we find that delisting the species is warranted. Our review indicates that the threats to the Roanoke logperch have been eliminated or reduced to the point that the species no longer meets the definition of an endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Accordingly, the prohibitions and conservation measures provided by the Act, particularly through sections 7 and 9, will no longer apply to the Roanoke logperch.
