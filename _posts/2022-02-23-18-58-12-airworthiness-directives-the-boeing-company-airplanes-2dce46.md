## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that during a fleet sampling inspection, cracks were found on the inner cylinder pivot pins of the left and right main landing gear (MLG) on one of the airplanes. This AD requires repetitive lubrications of the left and right MLG truck beams and inner cylinder pivot joints; a review of the maintenance program documentation to verify that certain lubrication tasks are incorporated; repetitive inspections of the MLG inner cylinder pivot pins and inner cylinder bushings of the MLG truck beams and inner cylinder joints to detect friction, heat damage, excessive wear, cracking, and smearing of bushing material; and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
