## Summary

This notice seeks comments on two draft recommendations to update the HRSA-Supported Women's Preventive Services Guidelines ("Guidelines") relating to Screening for Diabetes in Pregnancy and Screening for Type 2 Diabetes after Pregnancy. The existing Guidelines address Screening for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) and Screening for Diabetes Mellitus after Pregnancy. These draft recommendations have been developed through a cooperative agreement, known as the Women's Preventive Services Initiative (WPSI), with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), through which they convene health professionals to develop draft recommendations. Under applicable law, non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance issuers offering non-grandfathered group and individual health insurance coverage must include coverage, without cost sharing, for certain preventive services, including those provided for in the HRSA-supported Guidelines. The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and the Treasury have previously issued regulations, which describe how group health plans and health insurance issuers apply the coverage requirements.
