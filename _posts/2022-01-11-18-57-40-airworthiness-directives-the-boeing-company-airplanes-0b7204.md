## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of damage to the thrust reverser (TR) translating sleeve secondary sliders due to contact between the slider and the slider track liner. This damage could reduce the fatigue life of the slider below its full design life for the TRs installed on certain engines. This AD requires determining the serial number of the TR and performing applicable on-condition actions; or replacing the TR with a serviceable TR. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
