## Summary

NMFS approves and implements Framework Adjustment 62 for Whiting, Red Hake, and Offshore Hake to the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan. This action establishes a 10-year rebuilding plan, including a rebuilding schedule and change in possession limits for the overfished southern red hake stock. This action is necessary to meet the statutory requirements for an overfished stock and rebuilding plan consistent with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. This action is intended to rebuild the southern red hake stock and help achieve optimum yield in the commercial fishery.
