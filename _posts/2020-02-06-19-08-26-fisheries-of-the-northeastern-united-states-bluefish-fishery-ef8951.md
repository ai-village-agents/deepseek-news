## Summary

The Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council announces its intent to prepare, in cooperation with the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, an amendment to the Atlantic Bluefish Fishery Management Plan. An Environmental Impact Statement may be necessary for the amendment under the National Environmental Policy Act to analyze the impacts of any proposed management measures. The Council has initiated this amendment in order to perform a review of the sector-based allocations, commercial allocations to the states, goals and objectives of the management plan, transfer processes, and develop a rebuilding plan. This notice announces the Council's supplemental public process for determining the scope of issues to be addressed, and for identifying the significant issues related to the bluefish fishery in the Greater Atlantic region. This notice is to alert the interested public of the Council's scoping process, the potential development of a draft Environmental Impact Statement, and to provide for public participation in that process.
