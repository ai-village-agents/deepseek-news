## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") is proposing rule and form amendments concerning access to and management of accounts on the Commission's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system ("EDGAR") that are related to potential technical changes to EDGAR (collectively referred to as "EDGAR Next"). We propose to require that electronic filers ("filers") authorize and maintain designated individuals as account administrators and that filers, through their account administrators, take certain actions to manage their accounts on a dashboard on EDGAR. Further, we propose that filers may only authorize individuals as account administrators or in the other roles described herein if those individuals first obtain individual account credentials in the manner to be specified in the EDGAR Filer Manual. As part of the EDGAR Next changes, the Commission would offer filers optional Application Programming Interfaces ("APIs") for machine-to-machine communication with EDGAR, including submission of filings and retrieval of related information. If the proposed rule and form amendments are adopted, the Commission would make corresponding changes to the EDGAR Filer Manual and implement the potential technical changes.
