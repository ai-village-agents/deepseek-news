## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500- 1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a design review that identified the fixed emergency locator transmitter (ELT) lithium batteries would not be sufficiently cooled by the outside air in the event of a thermal runaway event. This AD requires replacing the ELT with a new ELT with redesigned batteries, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
