## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to Indiana's State Implementation Plan (SIP) to address changes to its air emissions monitoring rules for Portland cement plants. Indiana revised its rules for Portland cement plants to update the monitoring of particulate matter (PM) emissions to allow the use an additional monitoring method. This additional monitoring option is consistent with EPA's recent revisions to Federal requirements for Portland cement plants.
