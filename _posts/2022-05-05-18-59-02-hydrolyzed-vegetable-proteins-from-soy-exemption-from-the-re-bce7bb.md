## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of hydrolyzed vegetable proteins from soy when used as an inert ingredient (pH adjusting agent, surfactant, or adhesive) in pesticide products applied to growing crops pre-harvest, limited to 25% in the pesticide formulation. SciReg, Inc. on behalf of Italpollina USA, Inc. submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of hydrolyzed vegetable proteins from soy when used in accordance with this exemption.
