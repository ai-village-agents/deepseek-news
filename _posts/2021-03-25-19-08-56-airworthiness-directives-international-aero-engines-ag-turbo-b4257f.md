## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-06-06 for all International Aero Engines AG (IAE) V2500-A1, V2522-A5, V2524- A5, V2525-D5, V2527-A5, V2527E-A5, V2527M-A5, V2528-D5, V2530-A5, and V2533-A5 model turbofan engines. AD 2019-06-06 required initial and repetitive borescope inspections (BSIs) of the M-flange and, if it fails the inspection, replacement of the diffuser case with a part eligible for installation. This AD requires an initial BSI of the M- flange and, if it fails the inspection, repetitive BSIs of the M-flange until replacement of the diffuser case M-flange. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
