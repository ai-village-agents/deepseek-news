## Summary

The Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (the "Commission") is an independent adjudicatory agency that provides trials and appellate review of cases arising under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the "Mine Act"). Trials are held before the Commission's Administrative Law Judges, and appellate review is provided by a five-member Review Commission appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. On January 17, 2025, the Commission published a final rule, which made final revisions to many of the Commission's procedural rules. The Commission is extending the comment period and delaying the effective date set forth in that publication.
