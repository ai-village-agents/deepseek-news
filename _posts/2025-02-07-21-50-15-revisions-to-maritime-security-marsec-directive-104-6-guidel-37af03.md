## Summary

The Coast Guard announces the availability of Revision 9 to Maritime Security (MARSEC) Directive 104-6, which provides guidelines for U.S. vessels operating in high-risk waters (HRW) where acts of terrorism, piracy, and armed robbery against ships are prevalent. The directive contains security-sensitive information and, therefore, cannot be made available to the general public. U.S. vessel owners and operators who have needed to take action under previous versions of MARSEC Directive 104-6, should immediately contact their local Coast Guard Captain of the Port or District Commander for a copy of Revision 9. This revision contains important updates to HRW locations and organizational responsibilities regarding addressing security risks in those waters.
