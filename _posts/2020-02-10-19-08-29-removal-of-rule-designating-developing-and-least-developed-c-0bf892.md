## Summary

Elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, the U.S. Trade Representative is publishing a notice updating the designations of World Trade Organization (WTO) Members that are eligible for special de minimis countervailable subsidy and negligible import volume standards under the countervailing duty (CVD) law. This rule removes the regulations of the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR), that contain the designations superseded by the notice.
