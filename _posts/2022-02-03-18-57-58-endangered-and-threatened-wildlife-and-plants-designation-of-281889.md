## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to designate critical habitat for the Tiehm's buckwheat (Eriogonum tiehmii), which the Service has proposed to list as endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). In total, we propose to designate approximately 910 acres (368 hectares) in one unit in Nevada as critical habitat for Tiehm's buckwheat. We also announce the availability of a draft economic analysis of the proposed critical habitat designation.
