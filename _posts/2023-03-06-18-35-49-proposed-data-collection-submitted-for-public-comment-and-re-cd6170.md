## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing efforts to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies to take this opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed data collection titled Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Asthma Call-back Survey (ACBS). The ACBS is an in-depth asthma survey conducted on a subset of BRFSS respondents with an asthma diagnosis with the goal to strengthen the existing body of asthma data and to address critical questions surrounding the health and experiences of persons with asthma.
