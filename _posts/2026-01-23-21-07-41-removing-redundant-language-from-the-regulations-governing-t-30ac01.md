## Summary

By this rule, the Census Bureau (Bureau) is amending its regulations that govern the furnishing of personal census data. Specifically, this rule removes two unnecessary sections that merely restate underlying statutory language. This action is necessary to reduce regulatory complexity and redundancy. The intended effect is to promote the simplicity and clarity of the Code of Federal Regulations for public benefit, without altering any substantive rights or obligations.
