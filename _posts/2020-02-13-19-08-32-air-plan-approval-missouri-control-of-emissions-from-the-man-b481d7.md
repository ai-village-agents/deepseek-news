## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing approval of a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by Missouri on February 15, 2019. The submission revises a Missouri regulation that controls emissions from facilities that manufacture paints, varnishes, enamels, and other allied surface coating products. The revisions to this rule include adding incorporations by reference to other State rules, including definitions specific to the rule, revising unnecessarily restrictive language, making other administrative wording changes, and do not impact the stringency of the SIP or air quality. Approval of these revisions will ensure consistency between state and federally-approved rules.
