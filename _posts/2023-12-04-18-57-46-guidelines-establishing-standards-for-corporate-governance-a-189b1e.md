## Summary

On October 11, 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) published in the Federal Register a proposal to issue Guidelines to FDIC's standards for safety and soundness regulations and make conforming amendments to its regulations. These Guidelines would apply to all insured state nonmember banks, state-licensed insured branches of foreign banks, and insured state savings associations that are subject to Section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act), with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more on or after the effective date of the final Guidelines. The FDIC has determined that an extension of the comment period until February 9, 2024, is appropriate.
