## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to revise an existing safety zone regulation in Tampa Bay within the geographic boundaries of the Captain of the Port (COTP) St. Petersburg Zone. The proposed change is designed to align the coordinates in the regulation with the coordinates needed to properly control traffic in cases of restricted visibility in Tampa Bay. The current coordinates do not reflect the safety zones that the Coast Guard intended to put in place. The Coast Guard invites your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
