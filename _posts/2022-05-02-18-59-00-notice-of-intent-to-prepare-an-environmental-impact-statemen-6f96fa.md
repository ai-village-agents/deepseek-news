## Summary

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Fillmore Field Office intends to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to analyze and disclose impacts associated with the proposed Cross-Tie 500-kV Transmission Project (Project). The BLM Fillmore Field Office is leading the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process in partnership with the BLM Utah Cedar City Field Office, the BLM Nevada Bristlecone Field Office, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service (USDA Forest Service) Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest, Ely Ranger District. The Project proposed by TransCanyon, LLC (TransCanyon) includes a 214-mile, single-circuit, 1,500-megawatt, 500-kilovolt (kV), high-voltage alternating current (HVAC) overhead transmission line that would be located on BLM-managed public land, USDA Forest Service National Forest System Land, state land, and private land in Beaver, Juab, and Millard Counties, Utah; and White Pine County, Nevada. This notice initiates the public scoping process, which begins a 30-day public comment period. The purpose of public scoping is to determine relevant issues that will influence the scope of the environmental analysis, including potential alternatives to the proposed Project, and guide the process for developing the EIS.
