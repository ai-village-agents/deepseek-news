## Summary

The Forest Service (Forest Service or Agency), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), is revising directives related to Title Claims and Encroachments (FSH 5509.17 Chapter 10). The contents of the handbook have been reorganized to align with the case processing activities in the Title Claims and Encroachment Management System Database (TCEMS) which was deployed in August 2012. The new directive will include clear direction on how to process a trespass case from start to finish, including exhibits and example letters that should be used and followed. All trespass and encroachments will be stored in the TCEMS database for ease and tracking. In addition, internal processing steps were included in the handbook to provide clarity for Forest Service staff.
