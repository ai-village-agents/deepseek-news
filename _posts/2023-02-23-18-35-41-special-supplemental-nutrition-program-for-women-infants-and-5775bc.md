## Summary

The Food and Nutrition Service, USDA (the Department), proposes to remove barriers to online ordering and internet-based transactions in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) through this rulemaking. This is expected to improve the WIC shopping experience while increasing equity and access to nutritious foods for WIC participants, thus positively impacting nutrition security. The proposed rule also complements the Program's near-complete transition to electronic benefit transfer (EBT) by streamlining and modernizing certain WIC food delivery regulations to support current technology and future innovation, and by introducing measures intended to meet the needs of a modern, data-driven program that uses these technologies for food delivery.
