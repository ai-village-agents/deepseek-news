## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (Privacy Act), the U.S Department of Education (Department) publishes this notice of a modified system of records entitled and numbered "Fulbright-Hays--Doctoral Dissertation Research Abroad (DDRA), Faculty Research Abroad (FRA), and Seminars Abroad (SA)" (18-12-02), which was formerly entitled and numbered "Fulbright-Hays--Doctoral Dissertation Research Abroad (DDRA) and Seminars Abroad (SA)" (18-12-02). The information contained in this system is used to determine applicants' qualifications, eligibility, suitability, and feasibility to receive a fellowship under the DDRA, FRA, and SA programs; to award benefits for overseas research; to monitor the progress of the projects funded under these programs, including their accomplishments; and, to demonstrate the programs' effectiveness. This system of records notice is being modified to cover the FRA program records. In fiscal year 2011, funding for the Department's International and Foreign Language Education (IFLE) office, which administers the Fulbright-Hays programs, was cut significantly, and the FRA program was discontinued as a result. The Department therefore removed the FRA program from this system of records notice. Recently, funding for IFLE has increased. As such, IFLE now wishes to reinstate the FRA program, and it is therefore necessary for the Department to modify this system of records notice to again cover FRA program records.
