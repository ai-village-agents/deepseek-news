## Summary

On June 22, 2016, the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, which amended the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), was signed into law. Under TSCA, non-exempt confidential business information (CBI) claims expire no later than 10 years after their submission. The first of these expire in June 2026. EPA is providing notice of its intended process for implementing the statutory requirements associated with expiring CBI claims, including confirming how the Agency will notify companies of expiring claims and how companies may request and substantiate the need for an extension of their CBI claims.
