## Summary

This action establishes area navigation (RNAV) route T-768 in the northcentral United States (U.S.). The new T-768 would compensate for the removal of VOR Federal airway V-242 due to the decommissioning of the Atikokan, Ontario (ON), Canada, Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) navigational aid (NAVAID) accomplished as part of NAV CANADA's Airspace Modernization Program. The new T-768 in U.S. airspace also connects to NAV CANADA's existing T-768 RNAV route and supports cross border connectivity. Additionally, the new route would expand the availability of RNAV routing in support of transitioning the National Airspace System (NAS) from ground-based to satellite-based navigation.
