## Summary

We, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce receipt of an application from Nipomo Community Service District (Applicant) for an incidental take permit (ITP) under the Endangered Species Act. The Applicant requests the ITP to take the California red-legged frog (Rana draytonii) incidental to the construction of a new lift station and associated facilities to decommission the existing Blacklake Wastewater Reclamation Facility, in San Luis Obispo County, California. We request public comment on the application, which includes the Applicant's proposed habitat conservation plan (HCP), and the Service's preliminary determination that the proposed permitting action may be eligible for a categorical exclusion pursuant to the Council on Environmental Quality's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations, the Department of the Interior's (DOI) NEPA regulations, and the DOI Departmental Manual. To make this preliminary determination, we prepared a draft environmental action statement and low-effect screening form, both of which are also available for public review. We invite comment from the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies.
