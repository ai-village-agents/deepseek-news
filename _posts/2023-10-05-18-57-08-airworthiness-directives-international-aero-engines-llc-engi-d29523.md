## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain International Aero Engines, LLC (IAE) Model PW1124G1-JM, PW1127G-JM, PW1127GA-JM, PW1129G-JM, PW1130G-JM, PW1133G-JM, and PW1133GA-JM engines. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that certain high-pressure compressor (HPC) 2nd stage rotors and HPC 4th stage rotors have potentially degraded knife-edge seals and abrasive coating of the rear wing 4th stage rotor due to having been cleaned in alkaline solution without masking the knife-edge seal coating. Operating in this condition could result in material degradation and fracture of the HPC 2nd stage rotor and HPC 4th stage rotor. This proposed AD would require replacement of certain HPC 2nd stage rotors and HPC 4th stage rotors. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
