## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a regulated navigation area for certain waters of the Duluth-Superior Harbor and the St. Louis River in Duluth, MN. This action is necessary to prevent disrupting engineered remedies that are a part of the St. Louis River Area of Concern sediment remediation project. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit anchoring, dredging, laying cable, dragging, seining, bottom fishing, conducting salvage operations, or any other activity which could potentially disturb the riverbed in the designated area unless authorized by the District Commander or the Captain of the Port. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
