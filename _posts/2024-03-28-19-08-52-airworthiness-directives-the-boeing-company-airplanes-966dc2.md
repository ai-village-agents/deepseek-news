## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 777 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report indicating multiple findings of cracks in the fuselage skin common to the underwing longeron (UWL). This proposed AD would require external or internal (depending on configuration) inspections for any cracking of the left and right side fuselage skin common to the UWL, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
