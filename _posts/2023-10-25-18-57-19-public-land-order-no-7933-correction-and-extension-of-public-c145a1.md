## Summary

This order extends the duration of the withdrawal created by Public Land Order (PLO) No. 7587, which withdrew 852 acres of National Forest System lands from location and entry under the United States mining laws, subject to valid existing rights, for an additional 20- year period. The purpose of this withdrawal is to protect the United States Forest Service-managed Langmuir Principal Research Site to study thundercloud mechanisms, lightning, and precipitation, for an additional 20 years. This order also corrects the legal description of, but does not change, the lands withdrawn.
