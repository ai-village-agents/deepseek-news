## Summary

The Helena-Lewis and Clark National Forest, Helena Ranger District, Montana, intends to prepare a draft supplemental environmental impact statement for the Telegraph Vegetation Project. The Telegraph Vegetation Project was approved by Helena-Lewis and Clark Forest Supervisor William Avey on January 9, 2017. When analyzing the wildland urban interface within the Telegraph Vegetation project, the Forest used the Region 1 Healthy Forest Restoration Act wildland urban interface boundary definition, rather than the 2005 Powell County Community Wildland Protection Plan, which defined the wildland urban interface differently. In addition, the Forest conducted 8.4 acres of treatments in lynx habitat under the assumption they were located in the wildland urban interface. However, they were outside of the 2005 Powell County Community Protection Plan wildland urban interface boundary. To address these discrepancies, a supplemental environmental impact statement is being prepared to assess what action should be taken. The draft supplemental environmental impact statement will be circulated.
