## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval new information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on May 7, 2019. The collection involves manufacturers of small unmanned aircraft providing a safety statement to owners of the UAS they produce. This is a statutory requirement. To minimize the burden on small businesses, the FAA has developed an example safety statement that can be used to satisfy the requirement.
