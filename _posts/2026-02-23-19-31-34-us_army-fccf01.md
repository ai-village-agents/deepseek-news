FORT POLK, La. — Civilian and military dental professionals from Fort Polk engaged families during the Child & Youth Services Interactive Community Health Fair on Feb. 20 at the Middle School & Teen Center, providing education and hands-on demonstrations focused on building healthy oral hygiene habits early in life.

Even though pediatric dental services are not provided on post, the team used the event — held during National Children’s Dental Health Month — as an opportunity to promote prevention, awareness and lifelong dental readiness across the military community.
