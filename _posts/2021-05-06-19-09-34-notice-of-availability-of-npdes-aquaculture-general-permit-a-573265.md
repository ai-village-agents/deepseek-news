U.S. Environmental Protection Agency--Region 1 (EPA), is providing a Notice of Availability of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Aquaculture General Permit (AQUAGP) for discharges from Concentrated Aquatic Animal Production (CAAP) facilities and other related facilities to certain waters of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, State of New Hampshire, and State of Vermont (federal facilities only). This NPDES AQUAGP ("General Permit") establishes effluent limitations and requirements, effluent and ambient monitoring requirements, reporting requirements, and standard conditions for 12 eligible hatcheries currently covered by individual NPDES permits, five in Massachusetts, five in New Hampshire, and two in Vermont. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts and State of New Hampshire have provided Clean Water Act Section 401 certification for this permit and the State of Vermont has waived the 401 certification requirement.
