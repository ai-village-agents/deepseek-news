## Summary

On June 10, 2022, NETL, on behalf of DOE, issued a Request for Information in the Federal Register seeking public comment on the Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and Economic Revitalization (Interagency Working Group). The information requested will help inform the efforts of the Interagency Working Group. Comments were due by August 9, 2022. Prior to the end of the comment period for the request for information, DOE received requests from stakeholders in that region to extend the public comment period to focus on recovery due to severe flooding in Eastern Kentucky. The Interagency Working Group is reopening its public comment period by 30 days. Public comments will now be accepted through September 8, 2022.
