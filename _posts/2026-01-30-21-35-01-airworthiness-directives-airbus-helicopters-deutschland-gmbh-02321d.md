## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (AHD) Model MBB-BK117 D-3 helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of excessive wear on the bearing bolts, installed on the swashplate, connecting the cardan ring and the control ring assembly. This AD requires initial and repetitive inspections of the swashplate for vertical and radial play and, depending on the results of the inspections, corrective actions. This AD also prohibits installing any affected bolt unless the bolts are new or certain requirements are met. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
