## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to revise its regulations for permanent safety zones in the Coast Guard Sector New York Captain of the Port Zone for recurring fireworks displays and swim events. Our proposed revision would update the list of events, alter the means of notification, and clarify the function of these safety zone regulations. The establishment of the proposed safety zones is necessary to protect event participants, waterway users, and vessels from the potential hazards associated with these recurring organized water events. When subject to enforcement, no person is authorized to access the proposed safety zones without permission from the Captain of the Port (COTP) or the COTP's designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
