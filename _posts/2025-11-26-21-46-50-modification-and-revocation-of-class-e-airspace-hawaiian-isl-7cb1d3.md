## Summary

This action modifies the Class E5 airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Lihue Airport (LIH), Lihue, HI; Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL), Honolulu, HI; and Ellison Onizuka Kona International at Keahole Airport (KOA), Kailua- Kona, HI, by adding an additional layer of Class E5 airspace area extending upward from 1,200 feet above the surface. This action complies with the international laws and treaties, and satisfies the State of Hawaii's domestic airspace requirements. Additionally, this action revokes the portions of the existing Class E5 airspace area 1,200 feet above the surface that extends beyond 12 miles from the shorelines of the Hawaiian Islands into international airspace. This action further modifies the Class E4 airspace area designated as an extension to a Class D or Class E surface area at KOA and revokes the Class E4 airspace area at LIH. These actions support the safe and efficient management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at airports within the Hawaiian Islands.
