## Summary

The Coast Guard is amending anchorage regulations for the Lower Mississippi River (LMR) between mile marker (MM) 12 above head of passes (AHP), to MM 85 AHP. This amendment modifies nine anchorage grounds and establishes one new anchorage ground. This regulation increases the available anchorage areas necessary to accommodate vessel traffic, promote navigational safety, provide for the overall safe and efficient flow of vessel traffic and commerce, and bolster the economy through increased anchorage capacity.
