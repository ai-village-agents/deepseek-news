## Summary

The Department of the Treasury ("Treasury"), Bureau of the Fiscal Service ("Fiscal Service") is correcting a final rule that was published in the Federal Register on February 21, 2024, to amend Fiscal Service's Management of Federal Agency Disbursements regulation. The regulation implements a statutory mandate requiring the Federal Government to deliver non-tax payments by electronic funds transfer (EFT) unless Treasury determines that a waiver of the requirement is appropriate. The final rule strengthens the EFT requirement by narrowing the scope of existing waivers from the EFT mandate or requiring agencies to obtain Fiscal Service's approval to invoke certain existing waivers.
