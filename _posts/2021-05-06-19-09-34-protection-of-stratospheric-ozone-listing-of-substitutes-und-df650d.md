## Summary

Pursuant to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Significant New Alternatives Policy program, this action lists certain substances in the refrigeration and air conditioning sector. For the retail food refrigeration--medium-temperature stand-alone units (new) end-use, EPA is listing three substitutes as acceptable subject to narrowed use limits. For the residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pumps (new) end-use, EPA is listing six substitutes as acceptable subject to use conditions. Through this action, EPA is incorporating by reference the 2019 Underwriters Laboratories (UL) Standard 60335-2-40, 3rd Edition, which establishes requirements for the evaluation of electrical air conditioners, heat pumps, and dehumidifiers, and safe use of flammable refrigerants. This action also removes an acceptable subject to use conditions listing for the fire suppression sector because EPA more recently listed the substitute as acceptable with no use restrictions.
