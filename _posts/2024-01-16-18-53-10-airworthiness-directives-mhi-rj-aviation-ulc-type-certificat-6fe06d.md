## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain MHI RJ Aviation ULC Model CL-600-2C10 (Regional Jet Series 700, 701 & 702); CL-600-2C11 (Regional Jet Series 550); CL-600-2D15 (Regional Jet Series 705); and CL-600-2D24 (Regional Jet Series 900) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that a potential crack of the tombstone fitting lug cannot be detected as the bushings remaining in place during accomplishment of the special detailed inspection (SDI) required by a certain airworthiness limitation (ALI) task. This proposed AD would require inspecting the tombstone fitting lug with a new SDI sub-surface ultrasound procedure when accomplishing the ALI task, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). This proposed AD would also require corrective actions if necessary. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
