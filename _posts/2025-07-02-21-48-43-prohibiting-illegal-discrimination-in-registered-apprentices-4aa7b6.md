## Summary

The Department of Labor (DOL or the Department) is issuing this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to remove undue regulatory burdens on registered apprenticeship program sponsors. The Department's proposal would rescind certain regulatory provisions that it believes are unlawful. It also includes conforming, technical changes to the Department's regulation that addresses Labor Standards for the Registration of Apprenticeship Programs. This proposed rule would streamline and simplify sponsors' obligations, while maintaining broad and effective nondiscrimination protections for apprentices and those seeking entry into apprenticeship programs. A brief summer of this document may be found at regulations.gov by searching by the RIN 1205- AC21.
