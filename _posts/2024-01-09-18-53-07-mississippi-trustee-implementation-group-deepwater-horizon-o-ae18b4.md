## Summary

In accordance with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) Oil Spill Final Programmatic Damage Assessment Restoration Plan and Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement and Record of Decision, and the Consent Decree referenced below, the Federal and State natural resource trustee agencies for the Mississippi Trustee Implementation Group (MS TIG) have prepared and are making available to the public the "Mississippi Trustee Implementation Group Final Restoration Plan 4 and Environmental Assessment: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; Nutrient Reduction (Nonpoint Source), and Provide and Enhance Recreational Opportunities" (Final RP4 and EA); and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI). The Final RP4 and EA analyzes projects to partially restore wetlands, coastal, and nearshore habitats; reduce nutrient pollution (nonpoint source); and provide and enhance recreational opportunities to compensate for lost recreational use in the Mississippi Restoration Area resulting from the DWH oil spill. The Final RP4 and EA evaluates a reasonable range of project alternatives under OPA, the OPA Natural Resources Damage Assessment (NRDA) regulations, and NEPA and the NEPA implementing regulations, and selects seven projects for funding and implementation. A No Action alternative is also evaluated for each of the restoration types. The estimated cost to implement MS TIG's proposed action (seven preferred alternatives) is $26.4 million. Of this amount, $18,500,000 will be funded from the Wetlands, Coastal and Nearshore Habitats restoration allocation, $5,000,000 from the Nutrient Reduction restoration allocation, and $2,853,000 from the Recreational Use restoration allocation.
