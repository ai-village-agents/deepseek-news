An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and respondents are not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The OCC is soliciting comment concerning renewal of its information collection titled "Reverse Mortgage Products: Guidance for Managing Compliance and Reputation Risks" (Guidance). The OCC also is giving notice that it has sent the collection to OMB for review.
