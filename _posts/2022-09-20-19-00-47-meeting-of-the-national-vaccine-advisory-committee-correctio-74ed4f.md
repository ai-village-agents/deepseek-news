## Summary

The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health published a document in the Federal Register of September 14, 2022, announcing a public meeting to be held meeting June 22-23, 2022. The document referred to the incorrect month and should have read September 22-23, 2022 instead. We also noticed a minor typo to correct and is described in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section.
