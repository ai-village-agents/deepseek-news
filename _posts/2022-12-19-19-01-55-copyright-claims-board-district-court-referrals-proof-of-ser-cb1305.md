## Summary

The U.S. Copyright Office is amending its regulations governing the appearance of law student representatives before the Copyright Claims Board, district court referrals, proof of service forms, and default proceedings. The amendments allow the Copyright Claims Board to modify or suspend certain rules when a claim is referred by a district court and, in cases that are first filed before the Copyright Claims Board, accept alternative proof of service forms. The amendments also clarify the rules governing default proceedings and law student representation, and make certain technical corrections.
