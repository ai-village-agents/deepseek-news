## Summary

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to receive input from the public on specific FEMA programs, regulations, collections of information, and policies for the agency to consider modifying, streamlining, expanding, or repealing in light of recent Executive orders. These efforts aim to help FEMA ensure that its programs, regulations, and policies contain necessary, properly tailored, and up-to-date requirements that effectively achieve FEMA's mission in a manner that furthers the goals of advancing equity for all, including those in underserved communities, bolstering resilience from the impacts of climate change, particularly for those disproportionately impacted by climate change, and environmental justice.
