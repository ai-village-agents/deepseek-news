## Summary

The FAA proposes to amend the regulatory definitions of certain air carrier and commercial operations. This proposed rule would add powered-lift to these definitions to ensure the appropriate sets of rules apply to air carriers' and certain commercial operators' operations of aircraft that FAA regulations define as powered-lift. The FAA also proposes to update certain basic requirements that apply to air carrier oversight, such as the contents of operations specifications and the qualifications applicable to certain management personnel. In addition, this proposed rule would apply the rules for commercial air tours to powered-lift. This proposed rule is an important step in the FAA's integration of new entrant aircraft in the National Airspace System (NAS).
