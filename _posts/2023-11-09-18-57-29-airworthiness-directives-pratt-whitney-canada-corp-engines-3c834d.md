## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Pratt & Whitney Canada Corp. (P&WC) Model PW307A and PW307D engines. This proposed AD was prompted by a root cause analysis of an event involving an uncontained failure of a high-pressure turbine (HPT) 1st-stage disk that resulted in high-energy debris penetrating the engine cowling and an aborted takeoff. This proposed AD would require removing from service and replacing certain HPT disks and would also prohibit installing certain HPT disks on any engine, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
