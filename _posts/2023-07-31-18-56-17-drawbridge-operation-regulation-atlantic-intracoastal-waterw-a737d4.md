## Summary

The Coast Guard is issuing a temporary deviation from the operating schedule that governs the Flagler Memorial Bridge, across Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway (AICW), mile 1021.8, at West Palm Beach, Florida. Palm Beach County and the communities surrounding the bridge have requested the Coast Guard consider placing additional weekday restrictions during peak traffic hours to assist with alleviating vehicle congestion. This deviation will test a change to the drawbridge operation schedule to determine whether a permanent change to the schedule is needed. The Coast Guard is seeking comments from the public regarding this deviation.
