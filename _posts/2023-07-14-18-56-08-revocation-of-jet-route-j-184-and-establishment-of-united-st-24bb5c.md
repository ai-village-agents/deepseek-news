## Summary

This action revokes Jet Route J-184 and establishes United States Area Navigation (RNAV) route Q-180 in the southwest United States. The existing Jet Route has service limitations associated with signal coverage related issues. The new RNAV route replaces the Jet Route, as well as provides additional RNAV routing within the National Airspace System (NAS) in support of transitioning it from a ground- based to satellite-based navigation system.
