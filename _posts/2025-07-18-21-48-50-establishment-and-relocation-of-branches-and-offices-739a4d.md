## Summary

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) proposes to amend the processes for an insured State nonmember bank to establish a branch or relocate a main office or branch by eliminating certain filing requirements, reducing processing timelines, and updating public notice procedures, and by making corresponding changes to the procedures applicable to the relocation of an insured branch of a foreign bank. The FDIC seeks comment on all aspects of the proposed rule.
