## Summary

Section 2145 of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) amended the maximum loan limits for manufactured home loans insured under Title I of the National Housing Act and required regulations to implement future indexing of the loan limit amounts for manufactured homes originated under the Manufactured Home Loan program. This rule establishes indexing methodologies using data from the United States Census Bureau ("Census") to annually calculate the loan limits for Manufactured Home Loans, Manufactured Home Lot Loans, and Manufactured Home and Lot Combination Loans ("Combination Loans") insured under Title I of the National Housing Act for the Manufactured Home Loan program. This final rule adopts HUD's October 18, 2022, proposed rule with changes.
