## Summary

This proposed rule would implement the Electronic Health Record (EHR) Reporting Program provision of the 21st Century Cures Act by establishing new Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements for health information technology (health IT) developers under the ONC Health IT Certification Program (Program). This proposed rule would also make several updates to certification criteria and implementation specifications recognized by the Program, including a revised certification criterion for decision support and revised certification criteria for patient demographics and observations and electronic case reporting. This proposed rule would establish a new baseline version of the United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI). Additionally, this proposed rule would provide enhancements to support information sharing under the information blocking regulations. The implementation of these provisions would advance interoperability, improve transparency, and support the access, exchange, and use of electronic health information. The proposed rule would also update the Program in additional ways to advance interoperability, enhance health IT certification, and reduce burden and costs.
