## Summary

The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is seeking comments on whether to grant a waiver of its Buy America requirements to the Nevada Department of Transportation (NVDOT) for certain components that are not produced in the United States for use in a high-speed passenger train project between Las Vegas, NV and Rancho Cucamonga, CA (Project). FRA selected the Project for funding under the Federal-State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail Program (FSP Program), and therefore, FRA's Buy America requirements apply to the Project. FRA's Buy America requirements include both FRA's statutory requirements, which require 100 percent of the manufactured products and steel and iron used in an FRA-funded project to be produced in the United States, and the Build America, Buy America Act (BABA), which requires that all construction materials used in the FRA-funded project be produced in the United States. FRA is not proposing to waive the applicable BABA requirements for construction materials used in the Project, and therefore this proposed waiver would not apply to the construction materials used in the Project. The proposed waiver would apply to the trainset, signal systems, high-speed rail turnout and fire alarm systems based on the domestic nonavailability of such components, as identified by NVDOT's railroad operating partner Brightline West and the two potential suppliers (Alstom and Siemens) of the rolling stock and signaling systems for the project. NVDOT and Brightline estimate that over 95 percent of the total direct dollar expenditures for the Project would be spent on domestically sourced products and labor, including 100 percent of the civil infrastructure costs.
