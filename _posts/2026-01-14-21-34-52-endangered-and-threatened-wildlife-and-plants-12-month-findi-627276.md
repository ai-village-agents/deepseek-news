## Summary

We, NMFS, have completed a comprehensive status review for the Olympic Peninsula (OP) Distinct Population Segment (DPS) of steelhead, Oncorhynchus mykiss, in response to a petition to list this species as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). We have determined that OP steelhead is a DPS under the ESA and that listing is not warranted at this time. Accordingly, NMFS will continue to monitor the OP steelhead DPS status, including working closely with Tribal and State co-managers.
