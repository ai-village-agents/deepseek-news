## Summary

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is announcing a series of public listening sessions to receive input as CISA develops proposed regulations required by the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA). CISA is interested in receiving public input on potential aspects of the proposed regulations prior to their publication in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), and issued a request for information in the Federal Register on September 12, 2022 (the "RFI") as a means to receive that input. These public listening sessions are intended to serve as an additional means for interested parties to provide input to CISA on the topics identified in the RFI prior to the publication of the NPRM.
