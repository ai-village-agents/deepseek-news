## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed generic information collection project titled Assessing Respirator Perceptions, Experiences, and Maintenance. NIOSH proposes using surveys, interviews, focus groups, and physiological monitoring to assess current perceptions in respirator use as well as gaps in respirator use, maintenance, and programs.
