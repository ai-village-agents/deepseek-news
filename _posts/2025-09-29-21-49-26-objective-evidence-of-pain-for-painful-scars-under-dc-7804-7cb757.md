## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes to revise 38 CFR 4.118, diagnostic code (DC) 7804 ("Scar(s), unstable or painful"), by adding a note clarifying that VA still requires objective evidence of pain when rating a scar as painful. The inclusion of this note would align with current policy and ensure consistent application of the rating criteria.
