## Summary

The National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) within the National Science Foundation (NSF) is announcing plans to request approval for a new collection referred to as the National Training, Education, and Workforce Survey (NTEWS). The NTEWS will be a new, voluntary data collection sponsored by NCSES and cosponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) within the U.S. Department of Education. The NTEWS serves to measure and understand two research concepts that are of national interest: (1) The education, training, and career pathways of skilled technical workers, and (2) the prevalence and interplay of education (postsecondary degrees and certificates), work credentials (certifications and licenses), and work experience programs among American workers. NCSES intends to release national estimates from the NTEWS collection. Under the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, NCSES is providing an opportunity for public comment on this action. After obtaining and considering public comment, NCSES will prepare the submission requesting that OMB approve clearance of this collection for three years.
