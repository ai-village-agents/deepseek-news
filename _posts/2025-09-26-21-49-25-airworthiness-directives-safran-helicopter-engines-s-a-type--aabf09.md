## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Safran Helicopter Engines, S.A. (Safran) Model Arriel 2E engines. This proposed AD was prompted by the determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would require revising existing maintenance or inspection program, to incorporate the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the existing approved aircraft maintenance program (AMP), as applicable. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
