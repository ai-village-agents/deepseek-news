## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") proposes to amend the test procedure for ceiling fan light kits ("CFLKs"). DOE proposes to update references to industry standards to their latest versions and incorporate industry standards necessary for executing the test; to allow for the use of a goniophotometer; to revise definitions regarding CFLKs with solid-state lighting ("SSL") light sources to clarify the scope and test methods for CFLKs; and to remove obsolete provisions. DOE is seeking comment from interested parties on the proposal.
