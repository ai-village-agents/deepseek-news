## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-11- 23, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. AD 2021-11-23 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, and, for certain airplanes, updating the hydraulic monitoring system to include additional redundancy. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-11-23, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations; as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also revises the applicability to include different airplanes. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
