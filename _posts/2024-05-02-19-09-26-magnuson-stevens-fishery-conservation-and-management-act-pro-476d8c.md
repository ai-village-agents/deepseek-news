## Summary

This action approves and implements Framework Adjustment 66 to the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan (FMP). This rule sets catch limits for 8 of the 20 multispecies stocks, modifies the accountability measure (AM) implementation catch threshold for Atlantic halibut, and makes a temporary modification to the AM implementation catch threshold for the scallop fishery for Georges Bank (GB) yellowtail flounder. This action is necessary to respond to updated scientific information and to achieve the goals and objectives of the fishery management plan. The measures are intended to help prevent overfishing, rebuild overfished stocks, achieve optimum yield, and ensure that management measures are based on the best scientific information available.
