## Summary

The Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing amendments to its decision-making process for selecting energy conservation standards. More specifically, DOE is proposing changes that would require DOE to conduct a comparative analysis of the relative costs and benefits of all of the proposed alternative levels for potentially establishing or amending an energy conservation standard in order to make a reliable determination that the chosen alternative is economically justified.
