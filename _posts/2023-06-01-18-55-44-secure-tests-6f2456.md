## Summary

The U.S. Copyright Office is issuing an interim rule amending its regulations governing the registration of copyright claims in secure tests to continue the current rule that was adopted to address the national emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Office has decided to continue allowing otherwise-eligible tests that were administered online during the national emergency to qualify as secure tests, provided the test administrator employs sufficient security measures. The Office is also continuing its procedure allowing examination of secure test claims via secure teleconference. Finally, the Office is requesting public comment whether the interim rule should be made permanent and whether it should restrict examinations of secure test claims to virtual examinations.
