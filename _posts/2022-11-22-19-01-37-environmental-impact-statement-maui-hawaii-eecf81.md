## Summary

The FHWA, in coordination with the Hawaii Department of Transportation (HDOT), is issuing this notice to invite comment and advise the public that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) will be prepared to study potential improvements to the Honoapiilani Highway (State Route No. 30) between Ukumehame and Launiupoko in West Maui. Improvements are needed to provide a reliable transportation facility that would not be inundated by the predicted 3.2-foot sea level rise and undermined by coastal erosion. The FHWA, as the Federal lead agency, and HDOT as the project sponsor and joint lead agency, will prepare an EIS for the Honoapiilani Highway Improvements Project, Ukumehame to Launiupoko, covering the 6-mile segment between milepost 11 in the vicinity of Papalaua Wayside Park in Ukumehame (southeastern terminus) and milepost 17 in Launiupoko, where Honoapiilani Highway currently connects with the existing southern terminus of the Lahaina Bypass (northwestern terminus of the project).
