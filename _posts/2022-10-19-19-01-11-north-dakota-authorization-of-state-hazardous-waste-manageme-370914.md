## Summary

The EPA is proposing to grant authorization to the State of North Dakota for changes to its hazardous waste program under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended, commonly referred to as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). EPA has determined that these changes satisfy all requirements needed to qualify for final authorization and is authorizing the State's changes through a direct final action, with the exception of Revision Checklist 241.
