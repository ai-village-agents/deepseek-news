## Summary

The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Oregon State Office announces its intent to prepare an EIS for the Central Oregon Irrigation District (COID) Pilot Butte Canal (PBC) Project in the proximity of Redmond and Bend, Oregon. The EIS process will examine three alignment alternatives for replacing the existing PBC with a piped and pressurized system. The purpose of the new system is to promote irrigation water conservation in COID-owned infrastructure, improve water delivery reliability to COID patrons, and reduce long- term operation and maintenance costs. NRCS is requesting comments to identify significant issues and potential alternatives, information, and analyses relevant to the proposed action from all interested individuals, Tribes, and Federal, State and local agencies and jurisdictions.
