## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all MHI RJ Aviation ULC Model CL-600-2E25 (Regional Jet Series 1000) airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
