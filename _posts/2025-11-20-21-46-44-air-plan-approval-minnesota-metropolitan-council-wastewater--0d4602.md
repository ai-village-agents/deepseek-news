## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a request from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) to revise its State Implementation Plan (SIP) by updating information for the Metropolitan Council Environmental Service (MCES) Metropolitan Council Wastewater Treatment Plant (Metro Plant) in Ramsey County, Minnesota. This SIP revision is being proposed in conjunction with an amendment to a part 70 permit maintaining federally enforceable title I SIP conditions. This SIP revision would result in a reduction of allowable emissions of particulate matter less than 10 microns (PM<INF>10</INF>) emitted by the facility.
