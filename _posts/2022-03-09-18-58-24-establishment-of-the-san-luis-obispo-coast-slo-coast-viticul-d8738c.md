## Summary

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) establishes the approximately 408,505-acre "San Luis Obispo Coast" viticultural area in San Luis Obispo County, California. TTB is also recognizing the abbreviated "SLO Coast" as the name of the AVA. The viticultural area is located entirely within the existing Central Coast viticultural area and encompasses the established Edna Valley and Arroyo Grande Valley AVAs. TTB designates viticultural areas to allow vintners to better describe the origin of their wines and to allow consumers to better identify wines they may purchase.
