## Summary

The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) requests input from interested parties on sustainable chemistry to guide future Federal efforts. The term "sustainable chemistry" does not have a consensus definition and most uses of the term indicate that it is synonymous with "green chemistry." Therefore, information is requested on the preferred definition for sustainable chemistry. OSTP requests comments on how the definition of sustainable chemistry could impact the following: The role of technology, Federal policies that may aid or hinder sustainable chemistry initiatives, future research to advance sustainable chemistry, financial and economic considerations, and Federal agency efforts. Comments provided in response to this RFI will be used to address Subtitle E--Sustainable Chemistry of the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to identify research questions and priorities to promote transformational progress in improving the sustainability of the chemical sciences.
