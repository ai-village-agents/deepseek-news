## Summary

This final rule updates the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) administrative procedures for assessing penalties and recovering funds procured by fraud under departmental programs. This rule implements the Administrative False Claims Act of 1986, as amended by the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2025. This final rule implements the NDAA to reflect the updated penalty levels, new definitions, and the option for the Board of Contract Appeals judges to act as presiding officers. This final rule also makes minor clarifications and DHS procedural changes.
