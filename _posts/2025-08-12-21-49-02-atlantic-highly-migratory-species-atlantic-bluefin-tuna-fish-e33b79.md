## Summary

NMFS closes the Angling category fishery for school and large school/small medium-sized (i.e., measuring 27 inches (68.5 centimeters (cm)) to less than 73 inches (185 cm) curved fork length (CFL)) Atlantic bluefin tuna (BFT) for the remainder of the 2025 fishing year. In addition to this closure, NMFS through a separate action is simultaneously closing the Angling category Gulf of Maine BFT fishery for large medium and giant ("trophy" (i.e., measuring 73 inches (185 cm) CFL or greater). As a result of these closure actions, the Angling category fishery for BFT of all size classes is closed for the remainder of the year. This closure applies to Atlantic Highly Migratory Species (HMS) Angling and HMS Charter/Headboat permitted vessels (when fishing recreationally for BFT).
