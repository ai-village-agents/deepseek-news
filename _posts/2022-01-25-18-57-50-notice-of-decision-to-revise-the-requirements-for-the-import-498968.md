## Summary

We are advising the public of our decision to revise the requirements relative to the importation into the United States of plums from Chile. Based on the findings of a commodity import evaluation document, which we made available to the public for review and comment through a previous notice, we have determined that, in addition to the existing option of irradiation, plums from Chile may safely be imported under a systems approach for mitigation of the risk posed by European grapevine moth, with an additional option for fumigation with methyl bromide.
