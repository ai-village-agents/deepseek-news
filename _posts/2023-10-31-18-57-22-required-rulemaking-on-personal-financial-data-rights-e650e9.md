## Summary

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is proposing a rule to implement personal financial data rights under the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA). The proposed rule would require depository and nondepository entities to make available to consumers and authorized third parties certain data relating to consumers' transactions and accounts; establish obligations for third parties accessing a consumer's data, including important privacy protections for that data; provide basic standards for data access; and promote fair, open, and inclusive industry standards.
