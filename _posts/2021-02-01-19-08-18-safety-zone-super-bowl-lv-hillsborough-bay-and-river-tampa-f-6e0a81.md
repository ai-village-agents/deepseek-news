## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone on certain waters of Garrison Channel, Seddon Channel Turning Basin, and the Hillsborough River, in the vicinity of downtown Tampa, Florida during the Super Bowl LV celebrations. The safety zone is necessary to protect the public and Super Bowl LV event personnel from the hazards associated with potential vessel traffic within the area of the safety zone. All persons and vessels would be required to transit through the safety zone at a steady speed and may not slow down, stop or anchor except in the case of unforeseen mechanical failure or other emergency unless given prior authorization from the Captain of the Port. Any person or vessel forced to slow or stop in the established zone must immediately notify the Captain of the Port Tampa via VHF channel 16.
