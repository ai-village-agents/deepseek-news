# Proposed Amendment and Establishment of Area Navigation (RNAV) Routes; Northeastern United States

**Published:** February 05, 2026 19:09 UTC

## Summary

This action proposes to amend low altitude RNAV route T-300, and establish low altitude RNAV routes T-391, T-393, and T-395 in the northeastern United States. The proposed changes would reduce the dependency of the National Airspace System (NAS) on ground-based navigational systems, and assist with the transition to a more efficient Performance Based Navigation (PBN) route structure. This proposal would also provide RNAV routing in support the FAA's VOR Minimum Operating Network (VOR MON) program.
