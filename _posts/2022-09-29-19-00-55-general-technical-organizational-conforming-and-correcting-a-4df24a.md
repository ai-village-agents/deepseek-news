## Summary

FMCSA amends its regulations by making technical corrections throughout the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs). The Agency makes minor changes to correct inadvertent errors and omissions, remove or update obsolete references, and improve the clarity and consistency of certain regulatory provisions. The Agency also makes nondiscretionary, ministerial changes that merely align regulatory requirements with the underlying statutory authority, including the Infrastructure Improvement and Jobs Act (IIJA), sometimes referred to as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, requirements. Additionally, the Agency makes changes relating to agency management and to FMCSA's rules of organization, procedures, or practice.
