## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all ATR-GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42 airplanes and Model ATR72 airplanes. This AD was prompted by in-service data, which revealed that the minimum operating airspeeds in severe icing conditions, computed to provide adequate stall margins, do not provide sufficient margins to stall speeds at high bank angle while exiting severe icing conditions. This AD requires revising the existing aircraft flight manual (AFM) and applicable corresponding operational procedures to provide emergency procedures and limitations for operating in severe icing conditions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
