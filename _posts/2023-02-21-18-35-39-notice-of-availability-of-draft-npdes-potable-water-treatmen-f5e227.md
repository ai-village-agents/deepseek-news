## Summary

The Director of the Water Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency--Region 1 (EPA), is providing a Notice of Availability for the Draft National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Potable Water Treatment Facility General Permit (Draft PWTF GP) for discharges to certain waters of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State of New Hampshire. This Draft PWTF GP establishes effluent limitations and requirements, effluent and ambient monitoring requirements, reporting requirements, and standard conditions for existing potable water treatment facilities that discharge wastewater associated with common water treatment processes (e.g., clarification, granular media filtration, microfiltration, etc.). The Draft PWTF GP is available on EPA Region 1's website at https://www.epa.gov/npdes-permits/potable- water-treatment-facility-general-permit-pwtf-gp-massachusetts-new- hampshire. The Fact Sheet for the Draft PWTF GP sets forth principal facts and the significant factual, legal, methodological, and policy questions considered in the development of the Draft Permit and is also available at this website.
