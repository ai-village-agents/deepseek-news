## Summary

The Surface Transportation Board proposes a rule to codify a longstanding voluntary practice whereby Class I carriers, through the Association of American Railroads (AAR), have annually reported tare weight and loss and damage data for use in the Board's Uniform Railroad Costing System. Under the Board's proposal, Class I carriers may choose whether to provide tare weight and loss and damage data through AAR or file the data individually.
