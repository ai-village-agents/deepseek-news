## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is requesting comments from all interested individuals and organizations on a revision and an extension of a currently approved information collection request associated with the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities grant activity. The purpose of the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities is to support the production and marketing of climate-smart commodities through a set of pilot projects that provide voluntary incentives through partners to producers and landowners, including early adopters, to implement climate-smart production practices, activities, and systems on working lands; measure and quantify, monitor and verify the carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) benefits associated with those practices; and develop markets and promote the resulting climate-smart commodities. Additional information on the partnerships is available at https://www.usda.gov/climate-solutions/climate-smart-commodities.
