## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of iron oxide (Fe<INF>3</INF>O<INF>4</INF>) (CAS Reg. No. 1317-61-9) when used as an inert ingredient (colorant) in pesticide formulations applied to animals. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service submitted a petition (IN-11661) to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of iron oxide (Fe<INF>3</INF>O<INF>4</INF>), when used in accordance with the terms of that exemption.
