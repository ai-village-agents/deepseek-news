## Summary

FRA is providing notice of its intent to review a quiet zone located in Deerfield Beach, Pompano Beach, Fort Lauderdale, Oakland Park, Wilton Manors, Dania Beach, Hollywood, and Hallandale Beach, Florida (Cities). Based on a high rate of reported accidents/incidents and related injuries and fatalities that occurred between January and December 2022, FRA has made a preliminary determination that the safety systems and measures implemented within the quiet zone do not fully compensate for the absence of routine sounding of locomotive horns due to a substantial increase in risk. In addition, FRA has made a preliminary determination of significant risk with respect to loss of life or serious personal injury within the quiet zone. Therefore, FRA intends to review existing conditions within the quiet zone to determine whether the quiet zone should be terminated or whether additional safety measures may be necessary to ensure motorist and pedestrian safety.
