## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is confirming the effective date of September 15, 2025, for the direct final rule published in the Federal Register on July 2, 2025. This direct final rule amended the NRC's regulations to revise the duration of design certifications (DCs). This action replaced the 15-year duration for DCs with a 40-year duration period, both for existing DCs currently in effect and generically for future DCs. This direct final rule did not change the date of issuance for existing DCs (i.e., the start date by which an existing DC may be referenced remains unchanged). This direct final rule also incorporated a minor editorial correction.
