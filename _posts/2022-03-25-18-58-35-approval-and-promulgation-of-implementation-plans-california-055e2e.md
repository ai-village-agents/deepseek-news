# Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; California; Correcting Amendments

## Summary

On August 28, 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule titled "Revisions to the California State Implementation Plan, Antelope Valley Air Quality Management District." That publication inadvertently omitted regulatory text rescinding four previously approved rules for the Antelope Valley Air Quality Management District portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). On September 20, 2016, the EPA issued a final rule titled "Approval of California Air Plan Revisions, Department of Pesticide Regulations." That publication listed the wrong EPA approval dates and Federal Register citations for certain rules. The EPA is taking direct final action to correct these errors.
