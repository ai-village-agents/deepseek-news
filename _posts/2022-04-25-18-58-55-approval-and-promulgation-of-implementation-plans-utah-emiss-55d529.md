## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving state implementation plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of Utah. The revisions fulfill the emissions statement rule and nonattainment new source review (NNSR) requirements for the 2015 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for the Uinta Basin, Northern Wasatch Front, and Southern Wasatch Front Marginal nonattainment areas. Utah submitted an emissions statement rule revision and a separate NNSR certification to meet, in part, the nonattainment requirements for Marginal ozone nonattainment areas under the 2015 8-hour ozone NAAQS. The State's submission of the emissions statement rule revision also included revisions to emissions reporting requirements for stationary sources, which are being approved in this final rule as well. The EPA is taking this action pursuant to sections 110, 172, and 182 of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
