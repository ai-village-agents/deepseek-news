## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District (MDAQMD or "District") portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern amended or rescinded prohibitory and administrative rules that regulate air pollutants under the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act"). We are proposing to rescind numerous requirements from the District's portion of the California SIP because the requirements can be replaced by more current requirements. We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
