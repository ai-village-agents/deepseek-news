In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) announces its plan to submit the Information Collection Request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review and approval and invites public comment. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Trucking Fleet Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for Managing Mixed Fleets. It is a survey study that will assess the self-reports of approximately 2,000 survey respondents, including commercial motor vehicle (CMV) fleet managers, CMV sales personnel, State and Federal government personnel, industry engineers, researchers, and CMV drivers. The questionnaire is designed to collect baseline opinions of automated driving systems (ADS) before and after hands-on demonstrations with ADS technologies.
