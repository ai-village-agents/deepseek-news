## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is seeking public comment on a draft regulatory issue summary (RIS) that reminds licensees of the NRC requirement that prior to granting or reinstating unescorted access (UA) or certifying unescorted access authorization (UAA) to non-immigrant foreign nationals for the purpose of performing work, licensees shall validate that the foreign national's claimed non- immigration status is correct. This is important to ensure that individuals to whom a licensee intends to grant UA to nuclear power plant protected or vital areas or any individual for whom a licensee or applicant intends to certify UAA, are trustworthy and reliable such that they do not constitute an unreasonable risk to public health and safety or the common defense and security, including the potential to commit radiological sabotage.
