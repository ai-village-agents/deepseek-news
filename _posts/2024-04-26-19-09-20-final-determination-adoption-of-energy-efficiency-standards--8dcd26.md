## Summary

The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) establishes procedures for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to consider adopting periodic revisions to the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) and to ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1: Energy Standard for Buildings, Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings (ASHRAE 90.1), subject to a determination by the agencies that the revised codes do not negatively affect the availability or affordability of new construction of single and multifamily housing covered by EISA, and a determination by the Secretary of Energy that the revised codes "would improve energy efficiency." At the time of developing the preliminary determination, the most recent editions of the codes for which DOE had issued efficiency determinations were ASHRAE 90.1-2019, and the 2021 IECC. This notice follows the notice of preliminary determination published on May 18, 2023, and announces the final determination of HUD and USDA as required under section 481(d)(1) of EISA. After consideration of public comments, HUD and USDA determine that the 2021 IECC and ASHRAE 90.1-2019 will not negatively affect the affordability and availability of housing covered by EISA.
