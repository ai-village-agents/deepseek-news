## Summary

This NPRM proposes to adopt and replace regulations relating to the key aspects of the placement, care, and services provided to unaccompanied children referred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), pursuant to ORR's responsibilities for coordinating and implementing the care and placement of unaccompanied children who are in Federal custody by reason of their immigration status under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (HSA) and the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA). ORR intends to promulgate a final rule that would establish a foundation for the Unaccompanied Children Program (UC Program) that is consistent with its statutory duties, for the benefit of unaccompanied children and to enhance public transparency as to the policies governing the operation of the UC Program. ORR also proposes this rule for the purpose of implementing the 1997 Flores Settlement Agreement (FSA), which remains in effect as a court-ordered consent decree to which the UC Program is subject. As modified in 2001, the FSA provides that it will terminate forty-five days after publication of final regulations implementing the agreement. ORR anticipates that any termination of the settlement based on the adoption of this proposal as a final rule would only be effective for those provisions that affect ORR and would not terminate provisions of the FSA for other Federal Government agencies.
