## Summary

This action modifies five existing high altitude area navigation (RNAV) routes (Q-routes), and establishes one new Q-route, in support of the FAA's VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program. This action improves the efficiency of the National Airspace System (NAS) by expanding the availability of RNAV routing and reducing the dependency on ground-based navigational systems.
