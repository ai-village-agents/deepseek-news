In accordance with the requirements of the PRA, the OCC may not conduct or sponsor, and the respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The OCC is soliciting comment concerning a revision to its information collection titled, "Record and Disclosure Requirements--Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Regulations B, E, M, Z, and DD and Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Regulation CC." The OCC also is giving notice that it has sent the collection to OMB for review.
