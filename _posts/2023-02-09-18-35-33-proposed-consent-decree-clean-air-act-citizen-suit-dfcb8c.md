## Summary

In accordance with the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA or the Act), notice is given of a proposed consent decree in Environmental Integrity Project, et al. v. Regan, No. 1:22-cv-2243 (D.D.C). On July 29, 2022, Plaintiffs Environmental Integrity Project, Chesapeake Climate Action Network, and Sierra Club filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) failed to perform certain non-discretionary duties in accordance with the Act to timely review and, if necessary, revise, the methods ("emission factors") used to estimate the quantity of emissions of carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, and oxides of nitrogen for municipal solid waste landfills. EPA is providing notice of this proposed consent decree, which would resolve all claims in the case by establishing deadlines for EPA to review and, if necessary, revise these emission factors for municipal solid waste landfills.
