## Summary

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is revising its regulations governing the Public Assistance program that provides grants to State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments, as well as eligible private nonprofit organizations, for debris removal, emergency protective measures, and the repair, replacement, or restoration of disaster-damaged facilities after a presidentially-declared major disaster to update the monetary threshold for when FEMA will process an application using "simplified procedures."
