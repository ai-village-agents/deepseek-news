## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-700, 737-800, 737-900, 737- 900ER, 737-8, and 737-9 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a passenger being unable to exit the lavatory during flight due to a broken latch that prevented toggling of the lock. This proposed AD would require replacing lavatory bifold door latches with latches having an improved design. This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
