## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary moving safety zone around the M/V ZHEN HUA 23 while it transits through the Port of Los Angeles to Fenix Marine Services (FMS), Pier LA 302. This safety zone is necessary to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards associated with oversized cargo transfer operations of two quay cranes and equipment, which will extend more than 200 feet out from the transiting vessel. Entry of persons or vessels into this safety zone is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port (COTP) Los Angeles-Long Beach, or their designated representative.
