## Summary

This final rule updates the prospective payment rates, the outlier threshold, and the wage index for Medicare inpatient hospital services provided by Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities (IPF), which include psychiatric hospitals and excluded psychiatric units of an acute care hospital or critical access hospital. Additionally, this final rule rebases and revises the IPF market basket to reflect a 2021 base year. These changes will be effective for IPF discharges occurring during the Fiscal Year (FY) beginning October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024 (FY 2024). In addition, this final rule discusses quality measures and reporting requirements under the Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities Quality Reporting (IPFQR) Program with changes beginning with the FY 2025 payment determination through changes beginning with the FY 2028 payment determination.
