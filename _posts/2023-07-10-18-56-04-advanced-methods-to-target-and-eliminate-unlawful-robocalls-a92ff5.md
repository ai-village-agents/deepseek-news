## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) proposes and seeks comment on a number of actions aimed protecting consumers from illegal calls, restore faith in caller ID, and hold voice service providers responsible for the calls on their networks. Specifically, the notice of proposed rulemaking proposes and seeks comment on several options to combat illegal calls, including: specific call blocking requirements; the correct way to notify callers when calls are blocked based on reasonable analytics; requiring the display of caller name information in certain instances and; a base forfeiture for failure to adopt affirmative, effective measures to prevent new or renewing customers from originating illegal calls. Additionally, the Notice of Inquiry seeks broad comment on tools used by voice service providers to combat illegal calls, such as honeypots, as well as on the status and use of call labeling.
