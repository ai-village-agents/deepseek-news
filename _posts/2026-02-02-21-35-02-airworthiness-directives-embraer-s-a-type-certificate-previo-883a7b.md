## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Embraer S.A. Model ERJ 190-300 and -400 airplanes. This AD was prompted by an inconsistency identified in the takeoff calculation module of the computerized airplane flight manual (CAFM). This AD requires revising the airplane flight manual (AFM) to incorporate a new CAFM version. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
