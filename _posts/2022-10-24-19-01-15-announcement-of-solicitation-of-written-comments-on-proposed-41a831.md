## Summary

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) solicits written comments on an additional objective proposed to be added to Healthy People 2030, and written comments from the public proposing additional new core, developmental, or research objectives to be included in Healthy People 2030. Public comment informed the development of Healthy People 2030. HHS will provide opportunities for public input periodically throughout the decade to ensure Healthy People 2030 reflects current public health priorities and public input. The updated set of Healthy People 2030 objectives will be incorporated on https://health.gov/healthypeople. This updated set will reflect further review and deliberation by federal Healthy People topic area workgroups, the Federal Interagency Workgroup on Healthy People 2030, and other federal subject matter experts.
