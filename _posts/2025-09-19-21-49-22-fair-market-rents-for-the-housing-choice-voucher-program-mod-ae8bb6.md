## Summary

The Department of the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) published a notice in the Federal Register of August 22, 2025 (HUD's FY26 notice), that describes the methods used to calculate the FY 2026 FMRs and lists the procedures for Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) to request reevaluations of their FMRs as required by the Housing Opportunity Through Modernization Act of 2016 (HOTMA). HUD's annual notices typically permit public comment through October 1 of a given year, even if they are published earlier than thirty days prior to that date. HUD's FY26 notice provided an opportunity for public comment but only through September 22, 2025. This notice corrects this error and extends the public comment period through October 1, 2025. This notice also corrects HUD's omission of the Urban Honolulu, HI Metropolitan Statistical Area (Urban Honolulu MSA) from the list of areas and counties in HUD's FY26 notice that have FMRs based on local ad hoc surveys collected prior to 2024, and provides that HUD has updated and corrected the values for FMRs for the Urban Honolulu MSA on HUD's Fair Market Rent Documentation System web page.
