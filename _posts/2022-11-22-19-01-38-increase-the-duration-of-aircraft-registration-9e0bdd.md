## Summary

The FAA is extending the duration of aircraft registration certificates from three years to seven years. Initial Certificates of Aircraft Registration will expire seven years from the month issued. In addition, the FAA is applying this amendment to all aircraft currently registered under existing FAA regulations governing aircraft registration, which will extend valid Certificates of Aircraft Registration to a seven-year duration. This rulemaking also makes other minor revisions to rules related to internal FAA registration processes.
