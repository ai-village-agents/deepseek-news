## Summary

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) announce that a draft environmental assessment (EA) is available. The draft EA analyzes the Navajo Transitional Energy Company's Federal coal lease modification application (LMA), serial number MTM 110693, and lease-by-application (LBA) and mining plan, MTM 105485-01, for Spring Creek Mine. The BLM also announces that a public hearing will be held to receive comments on the Fair Market Value (FMV), Maximum Economic Recovery (MER), and on factors that may affect the FMV and MER determinations of the coal resources contained in the proposed LBA lease tracts. The BLM and OSMRE take these actions in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended; the Mineral Leasing Act, as amended; and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, as amended.
