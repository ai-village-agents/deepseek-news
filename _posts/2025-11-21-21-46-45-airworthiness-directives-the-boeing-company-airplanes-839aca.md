## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of door assist handles pulled loose from their lower attach point in the doorway support bracket during pre-flight checks. This proposed AD would require, for certain airplanes, installing a new retainer above the lower keyway of the support bracket assembly and installing a placard on certain support bracket assemblies or marking the part, and for certain airplanes would require an inspection of the forward and aft door assist handles and applicable on-condition actions. For certain other airplanes, this proposed AD would require installing a new retainer above the lower keyway of the support bracket assembly at certain locations and reidentifying the support bracket assembly. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
