## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) addresses the Petitions for Reconsideration (Petitions) filed by National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) and Schools, Health & Libraries Broadband Coalition and others (SHLB et al.), asking that the Commission reinstate the eligibility restrictions it eliminated in the 2.5 GHz Report and Order, published on October 25, 2019, and create a window for additional educational use of the band. The Commission dismisses the Petitions in part and, alternatively and independently, denies the other two petitions. The Hawai'i Broadband Initiative filed a Petition for Reconsideration, which it subsequently requested leave to withdraw. The Commission grants Hawai'i Broadband Initiative's request to withdraw its petition.
