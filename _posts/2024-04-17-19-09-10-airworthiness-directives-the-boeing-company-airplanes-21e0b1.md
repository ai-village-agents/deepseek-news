## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-8 and 737-9 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that the loss of a ground through the P6 panel results in the failure of the standby power control unit (SPCU). The loss of the SPCU and ground through the P6 panel could result in the loss of significant flightcrew instrumentation and displays. This AD requires installing two bonding jumpers from the P6 panel structure to primary structure. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
