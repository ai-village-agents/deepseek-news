## Summary

In this rule, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by adding twenty-eight entities to the Entity List under the destinations of the People's Republic of China (China), Finland, Germany, Oman, Pakistan, Russia and the United Arab Emirates. These entities have been determined by the U.S. Government to be acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. This rule also revises two existing entries on the Entity List under the destinations of China and Pakistan and removes an entity from the Military-End User List under the destination of China.
