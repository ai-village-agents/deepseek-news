## Summary

On November 9, 2020, the Department of Commerce (Commerce) published the preliminary results of the changed circumstances review (CCR) of the antidumping duty (AD) order on certain pasta from Italy and preliminarily determined that Newlat Food S.p.A. (Newlat) is not the successor-in-interest to Delverde Industrie Alimentari S.p.A. (Delverde). Based on our analysis for the final results, Commerce continues to find that Newlat is not the successor-in-interest to Delverde.
