## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve both a state implementation plan (SIP) revision and title V operating permits program revision submitted by the Pennsylvania Departmental of Environmental Protection (PADEP) on behalf of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The SIP revision pertains to Pennsylvania's existing plan approval and operating permit program fee rules. The revision increases existing plan approval application and operating permit fees. The title V operating permit program revision amends the title V operating permit program fee schedules that fund the Pennsylvania title V operating permit program.
