## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A318, A319, A321, A330-200, A330-200 Freighter, A330- 300, A330-800, A330-900, A340-200, and A340-300 series airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, -233, -251N, -252N, -253N, - 271N, -272N, and -273N airplanes; and Model A340-541 and A340-642 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that a production deficiency of some SafeLav gaseous oxygen container (SLGOC) batches was identified during production testing of newly manufactured oxygen containers. This AD requires replacing affected SLGOCs and prohibiting the installation of affected SLGOCs, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
