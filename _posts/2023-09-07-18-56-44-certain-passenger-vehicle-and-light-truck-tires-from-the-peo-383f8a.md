## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily finds that certain exporters of passenger vehicle and light truck tires (passenger tires) from the People's Republic of China (China) made sales of subject merchandise at prices below normal value (NV) during the period of review (POR) August 1, 2021, through July 31, 2022. Commerce also preliminarily finds that eight companies had no shipments of subject merchandise during the POR, and that it is appropriate to rescind this review with respect to six companies because all requests for review of these companies were withdrawn.
