## Summary

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has prepared a final management plan (FMP) as part of the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary (CINMS or sanctuary) management plan review. The FMP, which replaces a 2009 sanctuary management plan, addresses current and emerging threats in CINMS and reflects changes in new science and technologies, how the public uses the sanctuary, and community needs. The FMP supports continued protection of sanctuary resources through enforcement of existing sanctuary regulations, education and outreach strategies that promote ocean stewardship, and community-inclusive involvement. Consistent with the information provided in the 2019 Notice of Intent, and information gathered through public scoping to prepare a draft environmental assessment (DEA) and draft management plan (DMP) for the sanctuary, and public comments received on the DMP, NOAA is not making modifications to the sanctuary regulations at this time, but may consider regulatory changes in the future. NOAA also prepared a final environmental assessment (FEA) and a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) for this action.
