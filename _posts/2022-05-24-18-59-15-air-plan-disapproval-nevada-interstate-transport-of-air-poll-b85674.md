## Summary

Pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act"), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to disapprove a state implementation plan (SIP) submittal from Nevada addressing interstate transport for the 2015 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). The "good neighbor" or "interstate transport" provision of the Act requires that each state's SIP contain adequate provisions to prohibit emissions from within the state from significantly contributing to nonattainment or interfering with maintenance of the NAAQS in other states. This requirement is part of the broader set of "infrastructure" requirements, which are designed to ensure that the structural components of each state's air quality management program are adequate to meet the state's responsibilities under the CAA. This disapproval, if finalized, will establish a 2-year deadline for the EPA to promulgate a federal implementation plan (FIP) to address the relevant interstate transport requirements, unless the EPA approves a subsequent SIP submittal that meets these requirements. Disapproval does not start a mandatory sanctions clock.
