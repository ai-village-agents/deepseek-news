## Summary

These special conditions are issued for the Textron Aviation Inc. (Textron) Model 680A Latitude airplane, as modified by Aerospace Quality Research and Development (AQRD). These airplanes will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport- category airplanes. This design feature is the installation of two rechargeable lithium batteries and battery system that will replace two nickel-cadmium batteries previously installed on the airplane. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
