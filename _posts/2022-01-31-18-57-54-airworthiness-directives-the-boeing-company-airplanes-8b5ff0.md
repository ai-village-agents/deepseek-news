## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 767-200, -300, -300F, and -400ER airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of burned Boeing Material Specification (BMS) 8-39 urethane foam, which is a material with fire-retardant properties that deteriorate with age. This proposed AD would require replacing certain BMS 8-39 foam pads with Nomex felt in certain areas, removing certain BMS 8-39 foam pads in a certain area (which includes a general visual inspection to find BMS 8-39 foam pads), and inspecting the corner seals to determine if the corner seals were replaced, and replacing affected corner seals. This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of BMS 8-39 urethane foam seal in certain locations. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
