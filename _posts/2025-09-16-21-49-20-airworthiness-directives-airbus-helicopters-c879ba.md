## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Helicopters Model AS 332L2 and EC 225LP helicopters. This AD was prompted by reports of overlengthened and deformed attachment bolts installed on the link of the main gearbox (MGB) suspension bar attachment bracket. This AD requires replacing certain attachment bolts on the MGB suspension bar fittings, inspecting the removed bolts, and reporting the results of this inspection to Airbus Helicopters. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
