## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-14- 09, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; Model A319 series airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, - 232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, - 213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2018-14-09 required repetitive inspections for cracking of the fastener holes in certain fuselage frames, and depending on airplane configuration, provides an optional terminating action to the repetitive inspections. This AD was prompted by reports of early cracking on the four holes of the crossbeam splicing at certain fuselage frames (FR). This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2018-14-09 at modified compliance times, requires further inspections, and provides optional terminating actions for certain airplanes; as specified in European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
