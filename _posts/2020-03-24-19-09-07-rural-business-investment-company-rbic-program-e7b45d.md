## Summary

The Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBS) published an interim rule on December 23, 2011, which made several revisions to the Rural Business Investment program. Through this action, RBS finalizes the rule based on public comments, amends its regulations, and incorporates new program requirements established in the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 Bill for the Rural Business Investment Program. This action, which affects some of the substantive aspects of the Rural Business Investment Program, is expected to decrease the time and workload necessary in carrying out the Rural Business Investment Program.
