## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) notifies interested parties that it intends to rescind a circumvention inquiry to determine whether certain lawn mowers assembled or completed in the United States by attaching Chinese cutting deck shells (attached to at least one significant non-engine component) to internal combustion engines are circumventing the antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on certain walk-behind lawn mowers and parts thereof (lawn mowers) from the People's Republic of China (China). Interested parties are invited to comment on this intent to rescind.
