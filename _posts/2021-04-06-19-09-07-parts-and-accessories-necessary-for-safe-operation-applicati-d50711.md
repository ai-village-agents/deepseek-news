## Summary

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) announces its decision to grant the application of Bendix Commercial Vehicle Systems, LLC (Bendix) for a limited five-year exemption to allow its Bendix Advance Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) technology to be mounted lower in the windshield on commercial motor vehicles (CMV) than is currently permitted. The Agency has determined that lower placement of the ADAS technology would not have an adverse impact on safety and that adherence to the terms and conditions of the exemption would likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to, or greater than, the level of safety provided by the regulation.
