## Summary

We are publishing our semiannual regulatory agenda (the Agenda) in accordance with Public Law 96-354, "The Regulatory Flexibility Act," and Executive Order 12866, "Regulatory Planning and Review." The NRC's Agenda is a compilation of all rulemaking activities on which we have recently completed action or have proposed or are considering action. We have completed 5 rulemaking activities since our complete Agenda was issued online at the Office of Management and Budget's website at https://www.reginfo.gov on January 4, 2023. This issuance of our Agenda contains 32 active and 21 long-term rulemaking activities: 3 are Economically Significant; 17 represent Other Significant agency priorities; 35 are Substantive, Nonsignificant rulemaking activities; and 3 are Administrative rulemaking activities. In addition, 7 rulemaking activities impact small entities. We are requesting comment on the rulemaking activities as identified in this Agenda. The NRC's last Agenda was issued for public comment on February 22, 2023.
