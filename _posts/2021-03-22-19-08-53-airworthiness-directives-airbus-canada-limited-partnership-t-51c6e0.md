## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500- 1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that threaded fuel couplings were incorrectly installed at final assembly and in service. This AD requires repetitive functional tests of the auxiliary power unit (APU) fuel feed line shroud, a general visual inspection of the APU fuel feed line shroud for any loose couplings; and tightening any loose couplings, which would terminate the repetitive functional tests. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
