## Summary

We, the Fish and Wildlife Service, announce receipt of an application from Peter Famulari to renew four incidental take permits (ITPs) under the Endangered Species Act. If granted, the renewed ITPs would authorize take of the Florida scrub-jay via destruction of the species' feeding, breeding, and sheltering habitat. The compensatory portion of the mitigation as described in the applicant's habitat conservation plan (HCP), as amended, has been completed; however, none of the activities covered by the HCP have occurred on the covered properties, and there has been no take of the species. We invite comments from the public and Federal, Tribal, State, and local governments on the applicant's HCP, our original set of findings, and our current review and certification which support categorical exclusions under the National Environmental Policy Act.
