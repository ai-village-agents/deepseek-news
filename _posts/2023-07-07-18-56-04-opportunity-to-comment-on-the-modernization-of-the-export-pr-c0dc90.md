## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration (ITA) includes the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (CS), which assists and advocates for U.S. businesses in international markets to foster U.S. economic prosperity. Utilizing its network of trade promotion and policy professionals located in 79 countries and 106 U.S. locations, CS promotes U.S. exports, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises; advances and protects U.S. commercial interests overseas; and attracts inward investment into the United States. CS is seeking feedback from the general public--including businesses that are new to exporting or not currently exporting--on ways to modernize services for the 21st century. CS is reviewing its services to assess their effectiveness in meeting the needs of U.S. exporters and identify opportunities to innovate and enhance services offered, with the objective of driving U.S. innovation and global competitiveness by increasing U.S. exports and ensuring more U.S. regions benefit, as well as workers and businesses from underserved communities.
