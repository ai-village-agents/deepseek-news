## Summary

The Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (State) has filed a petition for classification and application to obtain public land and mineral estate in lieu of lands to which the State was entitled but did not receive under its Statehood Act. This classification, made under Section 7 of the Taylor Grazing Act of June 8, 1934, satisfies in full the obligation to the State. This notice also terminates the classification of lands included in the State's application that are not needed to fulfill the obligation.
