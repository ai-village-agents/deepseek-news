## Summary

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980, as amended, along with other laws as applicable, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) intends to prepare a supplemental environmental impact statement (supplemental EIS) to consider the effects of a potential land exchange of certain lands owned by the King Cove Corporation and/or the State of Alaska with certain lands owned by the U.S. Government. King Cove would use the acquired land for a road corridor for noncommercial use through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge and the Izembek Wilderness Area. We furnish this notice to advise the public and other agencies of our intentions and to seek information and suggestions on the scope of issues to be addressed in the supplemental EIS. In particular, we will update information used in the 2013 analysis on the impacts of a then-proposed exchange and road corridor and the viability of alternatives to provide safe and reliable transportation between the City of King Cove, Alaska, and the airport at Cold Bay, Alaska.
