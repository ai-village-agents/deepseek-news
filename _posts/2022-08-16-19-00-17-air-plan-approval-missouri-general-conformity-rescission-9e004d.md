## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a revision to the Missouri State Implementation Plan (SIP). This final action will rescind the Missouri General Conformity Rule from the Missouri SIP. General Conformity ensures federal agency actions, such as airport construction, do not interfere with a state's plans to attain and maintain national standards for air quality. After rescission of the state's General Conformity Rule, federal agency actions will be subject to the Federal General Conformity Rule.
