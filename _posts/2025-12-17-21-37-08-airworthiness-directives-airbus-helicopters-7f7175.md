## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-09-15, which applies to certain Airbus Helicopters Model AS332C, AS332C1, AS332L, and AS332L1 helicopters. AD 2020-09-15 requires removing the removable parts of the dual hoist installation or removing the de-icing system and allows, for certain helicopters, revising the rotorcraft flight manual (RFM) for the helicopter and installing a placard as an optional method of compliance. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-09-15, analysis revealed that additional vibration level measurements are necessary. This proposed AD would retain all the requirements of AD 2020-09-15 and would require for certain helicopters repetitively measuring vibration levels in-flight, and depending on the results, performing corrective actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
