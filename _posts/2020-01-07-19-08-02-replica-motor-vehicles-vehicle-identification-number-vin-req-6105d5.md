## Summary

Section 24405 of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act) amended the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (Safety Act) to direct the Secretary of Transportation (NHTSA by delegation) to exempt annually a limited number of replica motor vehicles manufactured or imported by low-volume manufacturers from Federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSS) that apply to motor vehicles, but not standards that apply to motor vehicle equipment. To implement the exemption program and the procedural mandates of the FAST Act, NHTSA is proposing, in a new Part 586, requirements for registering as a replica manufacturer, submitting annual reports, providing consumer disclosures, and labeling. NHTSA is proposing procedures to exempt replica vehicles produced by registrants from all the FMVSS that apply to new motor vehicles. This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) also proposes changes to Part 565, to require manufacturers to encode specific information into each replica vehicle's VIN, and to Parts 566 and 567 for manufacturer identification and vehicle certification, respectively.
