## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) certain Airbus Helicopters Model AS332C, AS332C1, AS332L, AS332L1, AS332L2, AS355E, AS355F, AS355F1, AS355F2, AS355N, AS355NP, AS-365N2, AS 365 N3, EC 155B, EC155B1, EC225LP, SA-365N, and SA-365N1 helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of an unintentional activation of the hoist shear-button (shear-button) on the collective pitch handle during a night flight. This AD requires checking the operation of the shear- button safety-cap on each applicable collective pitch handle and prohibits installing certain part-numbered collective pitch handles or collective sticks with those part-numbered collective pitch handles installed unless certain requirements are met. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
