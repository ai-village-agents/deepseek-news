## Summary

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) is seeking input on a proposal to expand the operating hours of the Fedwire[supreg] Funds Service and the National Settlement Service (NSS). The Board proposes to expand the operating hours of the Fedwire Funds Service to 22 hours per day, 7 days per week, every day of the year (22x7x365) and to correspondingly expand the operating hours of NSS, with NSS closing 30 minutes earlier than the Fedwire Funds Service. At this time, the Board is not considering expanding operating hours for the Fedwire Securities Service. The Board requests comments on the potential benefits, risks, and implementation considerations of the proposal.
