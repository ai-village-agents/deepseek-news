## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd. & Co KG Trent XWB-75, Trent XWB- 79, Trent XWB-79B, and Trent XWB-84 model turbofan engines. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of a lack of weld fusion on the resistance welding during manufacturing, which could result in air leakage through the low-pressure turbine (LPT) rear support seal panel assembly ("LPT seal panel"). This proposed AD would require replacement of the LPT seal panel. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
