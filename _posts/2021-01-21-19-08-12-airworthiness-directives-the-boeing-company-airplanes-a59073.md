## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-14-13, which applies to certain The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER series airplanes. AD 2017-14-13 requires a torque check of the screws in the cover assembly of the heel rest for both the captain's and the first officer's rudder pedals, and corrective action if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2017-14-13, operators have continued to find loose rudder pedal cover fasteners on previously inspected airplanes and airplanes outside the applicability of AD 2017-14-13. This proposed AD would require modifying the rudder pedal cover and shroud, and apply to all The Boeing Company Model 737- 600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER series airplanes and Model 737-8 and 737-9 airplanes. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
