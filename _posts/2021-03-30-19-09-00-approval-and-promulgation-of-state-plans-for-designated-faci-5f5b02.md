## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a Clean Air Act (CAA or the "Act") section 111(d) state plan submitted by the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR or the "Department") on January 3, 2020. This plan was submitted to fulfill the requirements of the CAA and is responsive to the EPA's promulgation of Emission Guidelines and Compliance Times (EG) for existing municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills. The South Dakota state plan establishes performance standards and operating requirements for existing MSW landfills within the State of South Dakota and provides for the implementation and enforcement of those standards and requirements by the Department. The EPA is taking this action pursuant to requirements of the CAA.
