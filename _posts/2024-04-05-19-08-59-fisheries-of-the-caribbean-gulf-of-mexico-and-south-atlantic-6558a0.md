## Summary

NMFS announces the receipt of an application for an exempted fishing permit (EFP) from LGL Ecological Research Associates Inc. If granted, the EFP would allow the retention, up to 24 hours, and lethal harvest of a limited number of red drum, king mackerel, and Spanish mackerel harvested by approved participants in the Louisiana commercial menhaden purse seine fishery in Federal waters during the 2024 menhaden season. The project would seek to quantify bycatch and test post- release mortality of these species in the fishery to assess impacts the fishery may have on Federally-managed species in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf).
