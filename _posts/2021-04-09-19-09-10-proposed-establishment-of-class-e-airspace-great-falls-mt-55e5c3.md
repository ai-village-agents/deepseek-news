## Summary

This action proposes to establish Class E domestic en route airspace extending upward from 1,200 feet above the surface at Great Falls, MT. This airspace would facilitate vectoring of Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) aircraft and it would properly contain IFR aircraft operating on direct routes under the control of Salt Lake City Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC). The FAA is proposing this action to enhance the safety and management of IFR operations within the National Airspace System (NAS).
