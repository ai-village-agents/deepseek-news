## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of New Jersey, through the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, on December 14, 2017. The revision submitted by New Jersey was in response to a finding of substantial inadequacy and a SIP call published on June 12, 2015, for a provision in the New Jersey SIP related to excess emissions during startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) events. EPA is proposing approval of the SIP revision and proposing to determine that such SIP revision corrects the deficiency identified in the June 12, 2015, SIP call.
