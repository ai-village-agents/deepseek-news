## Summary

This final rule establishes definitions, a test procedure, and sampling and representation requirements for air cleaners. Currently, air cleaners are not subject to U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) test procedures or energy conservation standards. DOE is establishing a test procedure for measuring the integrated energy factor of air cleaners. The test method references the relevant industry standard, with certain modifications.
