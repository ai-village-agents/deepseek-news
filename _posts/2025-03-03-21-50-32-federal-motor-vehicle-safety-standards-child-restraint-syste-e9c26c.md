## Summary

This document corrects a January 7, 2025 final rule that amended Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 225; "Child restraint anchorage systems," and FMVSS No. 213b; "Child restraint systems," to improve ease-of-use of the lower and tether anchorages, improve correct use of child restraint systems in vehicles, and maintain or improve the correct use and effectiveness of child restraint systems (CRSs) in motor vehicles. The final rule fulfilled a mandate of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP- 21) requiring that NHTSA improve the ease-of-use for lower anchorages and tethers in all rear seat positions.
