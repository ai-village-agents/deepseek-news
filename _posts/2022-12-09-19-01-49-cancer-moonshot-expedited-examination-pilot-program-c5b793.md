## Summary

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO or Office) is implementing the Cancer Moonshot Expedited Examination Pilot Program to replace the Cancer Immunotherapy Pilot Program, which expedited examination for eligible patent applications pertaining to methods of treating a cancer using immunotherapy. The new pilot program broadens the scope of qualifying technologies. Applications accepted into the new pilot program will be advanced out of turn (accorded special status) for examination until a first Office action. The new pilot program supports the renewed national Cancer Moonshot initiative that aims to reduce the cancer mortality rate by at least 50% within 25 years. This notice outlines the conditions, eligibility requirements, and guidelines of the new pilot program.
