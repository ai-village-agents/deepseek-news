## Summary

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) is amending its restricted area regulations to establish a restricted area within the explosive arc of the Six Mile Munitions Storage Area (MSA) on Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson (JBER). The restricted area is located within the navigable waters of Knik Arm which are a part of the Six Mile MSA explosive arc, extending from the shoreline of JBER to the outward limits of the arc. Establishment of the restricted area will prevent all vessels and individuals from entering the explosive arc area of the Six Mile MSA at all times, except for authorized vessels and individuals in support of military training and management activities. This restricted area is necessary to prevent unauthorized vessels and individuals from entering the explosive arc during an inadvertent detonation, and exposure to hazardous noise and fragments from such a detonation.
