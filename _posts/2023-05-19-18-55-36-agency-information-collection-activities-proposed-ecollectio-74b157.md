## Summary

The Department of Justice (DOJ), Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Statistics, will be submitting the following information collection request to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The proposed information collection was previously published in the Federal Register, volume 88 page 10937, on February 22, 2023, allowing a 60-day comment period. Following publication of the 60-day notice, the Bureau of Justice Statistics received four comments. Two of the comments expressed support for the continuation of the Annual Survey of Jails. The other two comments suggested new items to collect in the survey, including diagnosed disability and education level at admission; education and job training received during incarceration; job preparedness upon release; information on people who identify as transgender; jail population counts by combined race/ethnicity and sex categories; and admissions and releases from jail by race/ethnicity.
