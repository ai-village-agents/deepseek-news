## Summary

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) is publishing a final rule amending the requirements relating to operational risk management in the Board's Regulation HH, which applies to certain financial market utilities (FMUs) that have been designated as systemically important (designated FMUs) by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) under Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act or Act). The amendments update, refine, and add specificity to the operational risk management requirements in Regulation HH to reflect changes in the operational risk, technology, and regulatory landscape in which designated FMUs operate. The final rule also adopts specific incident- notification requirements.
