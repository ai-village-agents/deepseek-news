## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to remove an existing temporary safety zone which was put in place in response to the grounding of the M/V GOLDEN RAY. Salvage operations pertaining to the M/V GOLDEN RAY have concluded, therefore a safety zone is no longer required. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
