## Summary

This final rule sets forth changes to the Antarctic Marine Living Resources Convention Act of 1984 (AMLRCA) regulations, including those that implement the trade-monitoring program for frozen and fresh Dissostichus species, commonly marketed or referred to as Chilean seabass or Patagonian toothfish. Specifically, this action: revises regulations that specify the circumstances under which NMFS would deny issuance of a preapproval certificate that is required to legally import frozen Dissostichus species; adds regulations that specify the circumstances under which NMFS would deny issuance of a re-export or export document that is required to legally re-export or export both frozen and fresh Dissostichus species; clarifies that the applicable authorization must be received prior to re-export or export; and removes the prohibition on the importation of Dissostichus species harvested from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Statistical Areas 51 and 57. NMFS also makes other non- substantive technical and procedural updates.
