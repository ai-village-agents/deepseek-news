## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is making an interim final determination that the California Air Resources Board (CARB) has submitted revised rules on behalf of the San Diego County Air Pollution Control District (SDCAPCD or District) that correct deficiencies in its Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) state implementation plan (SIP) provisions concerning ozone nonattainment requirements for controlling volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the transfer of organic compounds into mobile transport tanks and concerning a negative declaration for non- Control Techniques Guidelines (CTG) major VOC sources. This determination is based on a proposed approval, published elsewhere in this Federal Register, of SDCAPCD's Rule 61.2 regulating the above source category and of the negative declaration for non-CTG major VOC sources. The effect of this interim final determination is that the imposition of sanctions that were triggered by a previous disapproval by the EPA in 2020 is now deferred. If the EPA finalizes its approval of the SDCAPCD's submissions, relief from these sanctions will become permanent.
