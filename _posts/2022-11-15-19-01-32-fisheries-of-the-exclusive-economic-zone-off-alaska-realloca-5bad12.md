NMFS is reallocating the projected unused amount of Pacific cod from catcher vessels using trawl gear and vessels using pot gear to catcher vessels using hook-and-line gear and catcher/processors using hook-and-line gear in the Western Regulatory Area of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). This action is necessary to allow the 2022 total allowable catch (TAC) of Pacific cod to be harvested.
