## Summary

In accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is modifying an existing system of records maintained by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Child Care (OCC): System Number 09-80-0371, OCC Federal Child Care Monthly Case Records. The system of records covers case-level information on low- income working families receiving child care financial assistance through the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF), which is provided in aggregate, non-identifiable format to Congress for empirical assessment, and to researchers and the public. Only certain pre-October 2015, case records (i.e., those that include Social Security Number (SSN) as a case identifier) are included in this system of records, because only those are retrieved by a personal identifier.
