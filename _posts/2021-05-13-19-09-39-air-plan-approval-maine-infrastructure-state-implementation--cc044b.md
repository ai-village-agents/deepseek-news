## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Maine. This revision addresses the infrastructure requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) for the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). This action includes all elements of these infrastructure requirements except for the "Good Neighbor" or "transport" provisions, which will be addressed in a future action. EPA is also approving a State of Maine submittal of amendments to 06- 096 CMR Chapter 110, "Ambient Air Quality Standards," as well as a submittal of statutory conflict-of-interest provisions in 38 Maine Revised Statutes Annotated (MRSA) Section 341-A and 341-C; resulting in the conversion of a number of previous conditional approvals. In addition, EPA is approving SIP revisions submitted by Maine that provide the state's determination, via a negative declaration for the 2008 and 2015 ozone standards, that there are no facilities within its borders subject to EPA's 2016 Control Technique Guideline (CTG) for the oil and gas industry. This action is being taken under the Clean Air Act.
