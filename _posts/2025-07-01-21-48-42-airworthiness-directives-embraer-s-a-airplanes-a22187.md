## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Embraer S.A. Model EMB-545 and EMB-550 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a jamming failure of the main door lock sensor. This AD requires repetitive main door sensor operational tests, repetitive lubrication of the main door sensor mechanism, and on condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.August 5, 2025.
