## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of sodium lauroyl sarcosinate when used as an inert ingredient in antimicrobial pesticide formulations applied to food-contact surfaces in public eating places, dairy-processing equipment, and food-processing equipment and utensils at an end-use concentration not to exceed 10,000 parts per million (ppm). Clorox Services Company representing Clorox Professional Products Company submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of sodium lauroyl sarcosinate when used in accordance with this exemption.
