## Summary

The EPA is promulgating this final rule to extend the reporting deadline under the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule for reporting year 2024 data from March 31, 2025, to May 30, 2025. This rule only changes the reporting deadline for annual greenhouse gas (GHG) reports for reporting year 2024. This rule does not change the reporting deadline for future years, and it does not change the requirements for what regulated entities must report.
