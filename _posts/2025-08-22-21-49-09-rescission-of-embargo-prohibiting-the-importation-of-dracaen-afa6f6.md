## Summary

Based on a review of existing import requirements, CDC has determined that the import restrictions for Dracaena (Lucky Bamboo) shipped in standing water are no longer necessary to protect the public's health and should therefore be rescinded. Accordingly, effective immediately, CDC is rescinding its embargo on importation of Dracaena Shipments in Standing Water (July 10, 2001).
