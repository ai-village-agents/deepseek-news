## Summary

On October 24, 2023, HUD published a Federal Register notice (October FR Notice) announcing and seeking public comment on changes to the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) for Purchase Program--Acceptable Monetary Investment Funding Sources and Interested Party Contributions requirements. The proposed changes from HUD's October FR Notice were included in an update to HUD's Single Family Housing Policy Handbook, which was published October 31, 2023, and becomes effective on April 29, 2024. After consideration of the public comments received in response to the notice of the proposed changes, FHA has decided not to implement some of the changes proposed in the October FR Notice at this time. HUD will publish a Mortgagee Letter or update the Single Family Housing Policy Handbook to align HUD's policy with this Federal Register notice. All other changes previously included in the Handbook will go into effect on April 29, 2024, as planned.
