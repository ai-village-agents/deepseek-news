## Summary

NMFS proposes regulations to implement amendments to the Fishery Management Plans (FMPs) for the Snapper-Grouper Fishery of the South Atlantic Region (Snapper-Grouper FMP), the Golden Crab Fishery of the South Atlantic Region (Golden Crab FMP), and the Dolphin and Wahoo Fishery of the Atlantic (Dolphin and Wahoo FMP), referenced here as the Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC) Control Rule Amendments. If implemented, this proposed rule would modify the ABC control rules, allow the phase-in of ABC changes, allow some carry-over of an unharvested portion of the annual catch limit (ACL) to the following fishing year, and modify the FMP framework procedures to implement carry-overs of ACLs when appropriate. The purpose of this proposed rule is to ensure catch level recommendations are based on the best scientific information available, prevent overfishing while achieving optimum yield (OY), and increase flexibility in setting catch limits. NMFS also proposes an administrative clarification to existing regulations for the Snapper-Grouper FMP framework procedure.
