## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is requesting nominations for voting members to serve on the Blood Products Advisory Committee (the Committee) in the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. Nominations will be accepted for upcoming vacancies effective with this notice. FDA seeks to include the views of women and men, members of all racial and ethnic groups, and individuals with and without disabilities on its advisory committees and, therefore, encourages nominations of appropriately qualified candidates from these groups. This notice is not for nominations for non-voting industry representatives.
