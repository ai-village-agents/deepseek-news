## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Commonwealth of Kentucky (Commonwealth), through the Energy and Environmental Cabinet (Cabinet) on October 15, 2020. The SIP revision updates the Commonwealth's regulation for the control of fugitive emissions. This revision contains minor non-substantive changes, grammatical edits, renumbering, the removal of one provision, the addition of one new requirement, and the incorporation of two definitions to support the new requirement. EPA is proposing to approve these changes pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act).
