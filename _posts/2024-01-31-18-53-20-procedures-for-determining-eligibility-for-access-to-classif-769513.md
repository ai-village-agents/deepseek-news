## Summary

The Department of Energy (DOE) proposes to amend its regulations, which set forth the policies and procedures for resolving questions concerning eligibility for DOE access authorizations. The proposed revisions would: expand the scope of the current rule to include individuals applying for or in positions requiring eligibility to hold a sensitive position; update and add clarity, including by deleting obsolete references, throughout the rule for consistency with national policies and DOE practices; and update references to DOE officials and offices.
