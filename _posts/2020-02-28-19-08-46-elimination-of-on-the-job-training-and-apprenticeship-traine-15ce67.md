## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes to amend its regulations that contain the requirements for certification of attendance at on-the-job training and apprenticeship programs under the Veterans Apprenticeship and Labor Opportunity Reform Act (VALOR Act). Section 3 of this law eliminated the requirement that trainees (veterans and other eligible persons who receive the training) certify attendance at on-the-job or apprentice training prior to disbursement of a training assistance allowance, thereby placing the responsibility solely on the employer to certify attendance in on-the-job and apprenticeship programs. Although it does not apply to chapter 30, we propose to eliminate the regulatory trainee certification requirement for chapter-30 trainees as well.
