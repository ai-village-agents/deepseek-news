## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Pratt & Whitney (PW) PW1519G, PW1521G, PW1521G-3, PW1521GA, PW1524G, PW1524G-3, PW1525G, and PW1525G-3 model turbofan engines. This AD requires the removal from service of certain electronic engine control (EEC) full authority digital electronic control (FADEC) software and the installation of a software version eligible for installation. This AD was prompted by reports of four in-flight shutdowns (IFSDs) due to failure of the low-pressure compressor (LPC) rotor 1 (R1) and by subsequent findings of cracked LPC R1s during inspections. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
