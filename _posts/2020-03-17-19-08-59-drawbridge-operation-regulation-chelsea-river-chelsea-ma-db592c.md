## Summary

The Coast Guard is modifying the operating schedule that governs the Chelsea Street Bridge across the Chelsea River, mile 1.3, at Chelsea, Massachusetts. The bridge owner, Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT), submitted a request to allow the bridge to open to 139 feet above mean high water instead of the full open position of 175 feet unless a full bridge opening is requested. It is expected that this change to the regulations will create efficiency in drawbridge operations and better serve the needs of the community while continuing to meet the reasonable needs of navigation.
