## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model DC-10-10, DC-10-10F, DC-10-15, DC-10-30, DC- 10-30F (KC-10A and KDC-10), DC-10-40 and DC-10-40F airplanes; and Model MD-10-10F and MD-10-30F airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that an operator found a crack in the upper flange of the pylon aft bulkhead bracket. This AD requires a general visual inspection of the left and right wing pylon at the aft bulkhead bracket for any lockbolt and collar; repetitive surface and open hole eddy current high frequency (ETHF) inspections of the left and right wing pylon at the aft bulkhead bracket for any cracking; and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
