## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Yabor[atilde] Ind[uacute]stria Aeron[aacute]utica S.A. Model EMB-135, EMB-145, -145EP, -145ER, -145LR, -145MP, -145MR, and -145XR airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports that calculations provided by the automatic takeoff thrust control system (ATTCS) are incorrect under certain conditions. This AD requires updating the software of the installed full authority digital engine control (FADEC) systems, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
