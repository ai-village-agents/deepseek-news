# Process for Establishing Rates for Veterinary Services User Fees

## Summary

We are proposing to amend the regulations concerning user fees that we charge for veterinary diagnostic services and for certain import-related and export-related services for live animals, animal products and byproducts, birds, germplasm, organisms, and vectors. We are proposing to remove the tables providing the individual fees from the regulations and post them on an Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) website instead. The regulations would instead specify the methodology (formula) used to calculate the fees (including imputed costs), and APHIS would update the fees using a notice-based process. Replacing the current user fee listings with a standardized methodology would increase transparency in the process of setting fee rates, align the regulations with other Departmental practices, and allow us to streamline processes and reduce the number of rules needed in order to update the fees.
