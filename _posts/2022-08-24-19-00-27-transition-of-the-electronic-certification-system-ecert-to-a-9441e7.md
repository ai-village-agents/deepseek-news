## Summary

This document announces the transition of the Electronic Certification System (eCERT) to an updated version, eCERT 2.0, which will become the sole method for participating in the eCERT process. The updated version includes three new features that will enhance the existing system by implementing additional validations that verify the authorized use of quota certificates. The use of eCERT 2.0 will allow for the decrementing of quota certificates to prevent those certificates from being overused. Participating countries will have enhanced querying capabilities to query and track actual certificate usage. Additionally, importers will be able to query their usage of the quota certificates via the Automated Broker Interface. In order to participate in eCERT 2.0, importers must provide the participating country with the Importer of Record (IOR) number in advance of filing an entry, and, in turn, the participating country must submit the IOR number as an additional data element of information within the transmission for eCERT 2.0. The transition to eCERT 2.0 will not change the tariff-rate quota or tariff preference level filing process or requirements. Importers will continue to provide the export certificate or certificate of eligibility numbers from the participating countries in the same manner as when currently filing entry summaries with U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The format of the export certificate and certificate of eligibility numbers will remain the same for the corresponding eCERT transmissions.
