## Summary

The Department of Commerce ("Department") seeks nominations for immediate consideration for a Selection Committee that will play an important role in the success of the national semiconductor technology center ("NSTC"), a public private-sector consortium that the Secretary of Commerce will establish under the CHIPS Act. The Selection Committee is responsible for selecting individuals, who will serve as board members and form an independent, non-profit entity that the Department anticipates will serve as the operator of the NSTC. The Department will choose the Selection Committee members from the nominations submitted in response to this FRN. The Selection Committee will act independently of the Department. The Department seeks nominations of individuals for the Selection Committee, who by virtue of their experience and expertise, will identify distinguished, purpose-driven, visionary leaders for the new independent, non-profit entity.
