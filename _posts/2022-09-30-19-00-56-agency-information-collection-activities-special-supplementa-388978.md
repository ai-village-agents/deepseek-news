In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice invites the general public and other public agencies to comment on a proposed information collection. This collection is a revision of the currently approved information collection for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which contains the reporting and recordkeeping burdens associated with the WIC Program regulations. These revisions include existing requirements that have been in use without Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval, identified during the drafting of proposed information collection requests associated with two rulemakings: the Revisions in the WIC Food Packages proposed rule and the WIC Online Ordering and Transactions proposed rule.
