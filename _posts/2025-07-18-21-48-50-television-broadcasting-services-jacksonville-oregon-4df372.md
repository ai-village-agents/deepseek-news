## Summary

This document proposes to amend the Table of TV Allotments (table) of the Federal Communications Commission's (Commission) rules by substituting channel *24 for channel *4 at Jacksonville, Oregon in response to a Petition for Rulemaking filed by theDove Media, Inc., the permittee of a new noncommercial educational (NCE) television station to serve Jacksonville, Oregon, Facility ID No. 791569. The staff engineering analysis finds that the proposal is in compliance with the Commission's principal community coverage and technical requirements. The substitution of channel *24 for channel *4 in the table will allow Petitioner to construct its new facility on a UHF channel and avoid the known viewer reception issues on its currently authorized VHF channel.
