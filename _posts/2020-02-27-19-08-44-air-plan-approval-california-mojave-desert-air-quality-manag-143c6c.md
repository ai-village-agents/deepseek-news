## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve revisions to the Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District (MDAQMD) portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) from Metal Parts and Products Coating Operations, and Polyester Resin Operations. We are approving two local rules that regulate these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act) as well as approving negative declarations for three subcategories of control techniques guidelines (CTG) sources in the MDAQMD. In addition, we are converting the partial conditional approval of the District's reasonably available control technology (RACT) SIPs for the 1997 and 2008 ozone standards, as it applies to these two rules, to a full approval.
