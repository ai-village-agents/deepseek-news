## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a 48-hour time limit in Anchorage Area (B) in Bolivar Roads near Galveston, Texas. Anchorage areas (A) and (C) in the Bolivar Roads Channel already have a 48-hour time limit, but anchorage (B) did not. This resulted in vessels remaining in anchorage (B) for extended periods, blocking other vessels with pressing logistical needs, adversely affecting commerce and impacting navigational safety. Except when stress of weather makes sailing impractical or hazardous, this rule will prohibit vessels from anchoring in anchorage area (B) for more than 48 hours unless expressly authorized by the Captain of the Port Houston-Galveston.
