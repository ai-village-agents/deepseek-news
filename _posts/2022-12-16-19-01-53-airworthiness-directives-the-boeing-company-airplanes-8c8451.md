## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 747-400 and 747-8 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of three opened door 5 right ceiling stowage boxes that fell freely and injured a flight attendant in each event. This AD requires replacing certain snubbers of the door 5 ceiling stowage boxes on certain airplanes, and replacing certain snubbers and changing the location of the snubber attachments on certain other airplanes. This AD also requires an operation check of the stowage boxes or snubber, as applicable, and applicable on- condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
