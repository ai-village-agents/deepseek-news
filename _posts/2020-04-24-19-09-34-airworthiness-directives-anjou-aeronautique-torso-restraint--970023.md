## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-16-04 for certain Anjou Aeronautique (formerly Romtex Anjou Aeronautique) Model 358 torso restraint systems (restraint systems). AD 2017-16-04 required inspection of the restraint system, placarding if it is found to be inoperative, and replacement of the affected restraint system with a part eligible for installation. This AD requires the removal from service of this expanded population of affected restraint systems and modifies the compliance schedule for their removal. This AD was prompted by reports to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), since the publication of AD 2017-16-04, of additional restraint system buckle knobs breaking on a batch of parts outside of the population identified in AD 2017-16-04. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
