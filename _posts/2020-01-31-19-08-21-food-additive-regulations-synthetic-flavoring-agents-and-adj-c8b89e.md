## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is responding to the submission styled as an objection submitted by Earthjustice on behalf of Breast Cancer Prevention Partners, Center for Environmental Health, Center for Food Safety, Center for Science in the Public Interest, Environmental Defense Fund, Environmental Working Group, and the Natural Resources Defense Council, on the final rule that amended the food additive regulations to no longer authorize the use of benzophenone, ethyl acrylate, eugenyl methyl ether, myrcene, pulegone, and pyridine as synthetic flavoring substances for use in food. The final rule also amended the food additive regulations to no longer provide for the use of benzophenone as a plasticizer in rubber articles intended for repeated use in contact with food. After reviewing the submission, we have concluded that the submission we received is not an objection and consequently does not provide a basis for modifying the regulations.
