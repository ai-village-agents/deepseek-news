## Summary

FSIS is announcing that Lithuania is eligible to export egg products to the United States. FSIS has reviewed Lithuania's laws, regulations, and inspection system, as implemented, and has determined that Lithuania's egg products inspection system is equivalent to the food safety inspection system for egg products that the United States has established under the Egg Products Inspection Act (EPIA) and its implementing regulations. Therefore, egg products produced in certified Lithuanian establishments are eligible for export to the United States. All such products will be subject to reinspection at U.S. points-of- entry by FSIS inspectors.
