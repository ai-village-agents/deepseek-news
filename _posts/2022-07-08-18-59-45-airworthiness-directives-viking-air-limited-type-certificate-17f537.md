## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Viking Air Limited (type certificate previously held by Bombardier Inc. and de Havilland Inc.) Model DHC-2 Mk. I airplanes with Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) No. SA01324CH installed. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of damage in the main wing spar. This proposed AD would require inspecting the wing structure for damage (drill starts, corrosion, cracks, and improperly installed fasteners), repairing damage and reporting the inspection results if necessary. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
