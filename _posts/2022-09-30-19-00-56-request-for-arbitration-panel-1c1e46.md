## Summary

The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS), invites the general public and other Federal Agencies to take this opportunity to comment on the following information collection request, Request for Arbitration Panel, FMCS Form R-43. This information collection request was previously approved by the Office of Management Budget (OMB) and FMCS is requesting a revision of a currently approved collection. The Request for Arbitration Panel, FMCS Form R-43, allows FMCS to comply with its statutory obligation pursuant to statute to make governmental facilities available for voluntary arbitration. To carry out this policy, FMCS have issued regulations which provide for the operation and maintenance of a roster of professional arbitrators. The arbitrators are private citizens, not employees of FMCS, and are paid by the parties for hearing and deciding the issues submitted under a collective bargaining agreement and in other circumstances. The Request for Arbitration Panel (FMCS Form R-43) is used by the parties, labor and management individually or jointly, to request that FMCS furnish a list of arbitrators.
