## Summary

This action amends Jet Route J-146 and establishes United States Area Navigation (RNAV) Route Q-186 segments within U.S. airspace. The FAA is taking this action due to the planned decommissioning of the Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) portion of the Chardon, OH (CXR), VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) navigational aid (NAVAID). The Chardon VOR is being decommissioned in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
