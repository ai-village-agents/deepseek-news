## Summary

On April 6, 2022, the Postal Service Reform Act of 2022 was signed into law. Section 204 of that Act raised the annual cap on the number of copies that a Periodicals publisher can send to nonsubscribers at In-County rates from 10 percent of the number of copies sent to subscribers at In-County rates to 50 percent. This final rule contains revisions to Mailing Standards of the United States Postal Service, Domestic Mail Manual (DMM[supreg]), to implement the change.
