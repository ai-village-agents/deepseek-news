## Summary

The Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service or "we") is adopting the changes proposed in its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for its regulation governing the use of the Automated Clearing House (ACH) Network by Federal agencies. Our regulation adopts, with some exceptions, the NACHA Operating Rules developed by NACHA--The Electronic Payments Association (now known as Nacha), as the rules governing the use of the ACH Network by Federal agencies. We are issuing this final rule to address changes that Nacha has made to the NACHA Operating Rules since the publication of the 2016 NACHA Operating Rules & Guidelines book. These changes include amendments set forth in the 2017, 2018, and 2019 NACHA Operating Rules & Guidelines books with an effective date on or before June 30, 2021.
