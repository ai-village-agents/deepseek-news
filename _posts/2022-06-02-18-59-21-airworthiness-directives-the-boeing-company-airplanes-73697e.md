## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of a missing shim at a joint common to the main torque box (MTB) skin panel and rear spar root fitting. This AD requires inspecting the MTB skin panel and rear spar root fitting for cracking and delamination, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
