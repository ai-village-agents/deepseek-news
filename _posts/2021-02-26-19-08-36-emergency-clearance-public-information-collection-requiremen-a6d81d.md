## Summary

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) requests an information collection request to support the implementation of the CAHPS for MIPS survey to add an item on telehealth to address the Public Health Emergency (PHE) be processed under the emergency clearance process associated with Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA). In order to address our stakeholders and the increased use of telehealth services due to the PHE for COVID-19, a question is being added to the CAHPS for MIPS survey. The question is being added to integrate one telehealth item to assess the patient-reported usage of telehealth services (for example, phone or video visit). The additional question collects self-reported information from CAHPS for MIPS Survey respondents on the modalities of care (in-person, telephone or video visit) received during the last 6 months. This survey item would be utilized for informational purposes only and would not be used for quality scoring or payment purposes. We are requesting Emergency Approval in order to make this telehealth item part of the survey starting in CY 2021, which is in alignment with what our stakeholders have requested. In order to do this, there are tasks that need to be completed by late spring such as vendor training, preparing letters and Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) scripts.
