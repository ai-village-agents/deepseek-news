## Summary

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) proposes to collect additional data from certain market-based rate (MBR) sellers with ultimate upstream affiliates that have been granted blanket authorization. The Commission proposes revisions to the data dictionary that accompanies the relational database established in Order No. 860 to include new requirements for those MBR sellers to report connections to an entity whose securities were acquired pursuant to the blanket authorization. In addition, the Commission plans to request approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for this collection of information.
