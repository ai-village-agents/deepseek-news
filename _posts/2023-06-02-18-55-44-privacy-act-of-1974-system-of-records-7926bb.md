## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, and Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-108 Federal Agency Responsibilities for Review, Reporting, and Publication under the Privacy Act, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) proposes a new system of records, USDA/OSSP-1, the Enterprise Physical Access Control System (ePACS). The Office of the Safety, Security, and Protections maintains ePACS, which contains the information required to control physical access to USDA managed facilities and restricted areas within the facilities in all regions across the United States. The notice also conveys the system location, categories of records, routine uses (one of which permits records to be provided to the National Archives and Records Administration), storage, safeguards, retention and disposal, system manager and address, notification procedures, records access, and contesting procedures.
