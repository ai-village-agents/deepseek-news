The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve the request to redesignate portions of Saline County, Salina, Kansas to attainment for the 2008 lead National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The EPA's proposed approval of the redesignation request is based on the determination that the Salina area has met the criteria for redesignation to attainment set forth in the Clean Air Act (CAA), including the determination that the area has attained the standard. Additionally, the EPA is proposing to approve the State's plan for maintaining the 2008 lead NAAQS in the Salina area for ten years beyond redesignation.
