## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-24-07 for certain Airbus Helicopters Model AS350B3, EC130B4, and EC130T2 helicopters. AD 2020-24-07 required modifying and inspecting the throttle twist grip (twist grip). Since the FAA issued AD 2020-24-07, there have been reports of the engine remaining in idle when the twist grip was turned to the "FLIGHT" mode. This AD retains the actions required by AD 2020-24-07 and adds a modification that constitutes terminating action for the repetitive inspections. This AD also expands the helicopter applicability, provides additional requirements for certain helicopters, and prohibits installing affected microswitches or an affected twist grip with the affected microswitch. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
