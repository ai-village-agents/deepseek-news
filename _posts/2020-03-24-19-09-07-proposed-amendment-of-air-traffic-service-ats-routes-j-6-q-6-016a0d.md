## Summary

This action proposes to amend one jet route, J-6; three VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways, V-5, V-49, and V-243; and two area navigation (RNAV) routes, Q-68 and T-325. The FAA is proposing this action due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Bowling Green, KY, VOR/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) navigation aid (NAVAID). The Bowling Green VOR is being decommissioned in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
