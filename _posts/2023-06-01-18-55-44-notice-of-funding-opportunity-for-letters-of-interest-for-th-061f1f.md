## Summary

This Notice of Funding Opportunity ("NOFO") for the RRIF Express Pilot Program ("RRIF Express") expands the ability of eligible borrowers to access funds by removing the caps on Cost Assistance for advisor fees and Credit Risk Premium ("CRP") Assistance, provides greater flexibility by allowing unaudited financial statements in lieu of audited financial statements in certain circumstances, and makes other clarifications. The NOFO also implements a sunset date of December 1, 2023. Following the sunset date, this NOFO will expire, and all benefits made available in this Notice will become available to any eligible RRIF borrower, consistent with existing law. All projects that were previously eligible for RRIF Express financing remain eligible under this NOFO. The original NOFO with modifications is in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section.
