## Summary

This proposed rule would revise the Medicare Advantage (Part C), Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Part D), Medicare cost plan, and Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) regulations to implement changes related to Star Ratings, medication therapy management, marketing and communications, health equity, provider directories, coverage criteria, prior authorization, passive enrollment, network adequacy, identification of overpayments, formulary changes, and other programmatic areas. This proposed rule would also codify regulations implementing section 118 of Division CC of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, section 11404 of the Inflation Reduction Act, and includes a large number of provisions that would codify existing sub-regulatory guidance in the Part C, Part D, and PACE programs. This proposed rule would also amend the existing regulations for Medicare Parts A, B, C, and D regarding the standard for an identified overpayment.
