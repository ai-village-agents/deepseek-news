## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to establish a permanent security zone for all navigable waters of the Lower Mississippi River (LMR) from mile marker (MM) 94 to MM 97, Above Head of Passes (AHP), New Orleans, LA. This security zone is necessary to expedite the establishment and enforcement of the security zones to protect vessels, waterfront facilities, the public, and other surrounding areas from destruction, loss, or injury caused by sabotage, subversive acts, accidents, or other actions of a similar nature. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit entry of vessels or persons from entering the security zone unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port Sector New Orleans (COTP) or a designated representative. This proposed security zone would be enforced only as necessary by the COTP through a notification of enforcement published in the Federal Register and announced through Vessel Traffic Service Advisories, Broadcast Notices to Mariners (BNMs), Local Notice to Mariners (LNMs), and/or Marine Safety Information Bulletins (MSIBs) as appropriate. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
