## Summary

The FAA is considering a proposal to change 22.5 acres of airport land from aeronautical use to non-aeronautical use and to authorize the sale of airport property located at Willow Run Airport, Detroit, Michigan. The aforementioned land is not needed for aeronautical use. The property is located on the east side of the airport, located west of Beck Road, south of D Street, and east of Third Street and is currently vacant land. The proposed sale will allow the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) to construct and operate a new water pump transfer station that will service the immediate surrounding community.
