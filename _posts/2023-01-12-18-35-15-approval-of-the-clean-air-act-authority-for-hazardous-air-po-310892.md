## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve the amended "Env-Sw 2100: Management and Control of Asbestos Sites Not Operated after July 9, 1981," effective September 1, 2018 ("amended Asbestos Disposal Site Rule") in place of the National Emission Standard for Asbestos ("Asbestos NESHAP") provisions for inactive waste disposal sites not operated after July 9, 1981 submitted by the State of New Hampshire. The intended effect of this action is to propose approval of the amended Asbestos Disposal Site Rule in place of the Asbestos NESHAP provisions for inactive waste disposal sites not operated after July 9, 1981. This approval would make the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services' (NH DES) amended Asbestos Disposal Site Rule federally enforceable. This action is being taken under the Clean Air Act.
