## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE" or the "Department") is publishing a final rule to amend the certification provisions for ceiling fan light kits, general service incandescent lamps, incandescent reflector lamps, ceiling fans, consumer furnaces and boilers, consumer water heaters, dishwashers, commercial clothes washers, battery chargers, and dedicated-purpose pool pumps. DOE is amending the certification and reporting provisions for these products and equipment to ensure reporting is consistent with currently applicable energy conservation standards and to ensure that DOE has the information necessary to determine the appropriate classification of products for the application of standards.
