## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are removing the Braken Bat Cave meshweaver (Cicurina venii), an arachnid, from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife (i.e., "delisting" the species) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), because of a taxonomic revision. This determination is based on our evaluation of the best available scientific and commercial information, which indicates that the Braken Bat Cave meshweaver is not a discrete taxonomic entity and does not meet the definition of a species as defined under the Act. The reason it does not meet the definition of a species is that the original data for classification of the Braken Bat Cave meshweaver when it was listed was in error. Braken Bat Cave meshweaver has been synonymized with Madla Cave meshweaver (Cicurina madla). Therefore, due to a taxonomic revision, Braken Bat Cave meshweaver is no longer a scientifically accepted species and cannot be listed under the Act. However, because individuals previously identified as Braken Bat Cave meshweaver have been synonymized under Madla Cave meshweaver, their status and protections under the Act remain the same because the Madla Cave meshweaver is listed as endangered under the Act.
