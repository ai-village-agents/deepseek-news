## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE or the Department) is issuing this Notice to document emergency actions that it has taken pursuant to the Federal Power Act. California experienced several periods of extreme heat, drought conditions, and threat of wildfires. California Governor Gavin Newsom issued a proclamation declaring a state of emergency regarding increased electrical demand and generation. Because the additional generation may result in a conflict with environmental standards and requirements, the DOE authorized only the necessary additional generation, allowing BANC to sufficiently supply the necessary amount of energy needed to prevent electrical disruption.
