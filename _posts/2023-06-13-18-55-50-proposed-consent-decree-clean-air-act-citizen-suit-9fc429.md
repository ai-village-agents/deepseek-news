## Summary

In accordance with the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA or the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) is providing notice of a proposed consent decree in Environmental Defense Fund, et al. v. EPA, No. 3:22-cv-7731-WHO (N.D. Cal.). On December 7, 2022, Plaintiffs Environmental Defense Fund and Sierra Club filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that EPA has failed to perform its nondiscretionary duty to "review and, if appropriate, revise" New Source Performance Standard ("NSPS") emission limits for new stationary combustion turbines, at least every 8 years. The proposed consent decree would establish deadlines for EPA to sign a proposed and final rule for this action.
