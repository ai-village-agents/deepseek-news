## Summary

The Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) to inform a decision about the designation of roads, trails, and areas of the Rio Grande National Forest (RGNF) which would be open to motorized over-snow use. The environmental impact statement will inform a decision about the classes of vehicles and times of year for which motorized over-snow use will be allowed on designated roads, trails, and areas. Roads, trails, and areas designated for motorized over-snow vehicle (OSV) use will be identified on an Over-Snow Vehicle Use Map which will specify the classes of vehicles and time of year for which use is designated on the Rio Grande National Forest. An additional map displaying the Desired Winter Recreation Opportunity Spectrum (ROS) settings will also be produced. The RGNF anticipates this travel management analysis based on the proposed action as presently described and the resulting decision may require an amendment to the Land Management Plan for the Forest.
