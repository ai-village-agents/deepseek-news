## Summary

Through this Request for Information (RFI), the Sexual & Gender Minority Research Office (SGMRO) in the Division of Program Coordination, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives (DPCPSI), Office of the Director (OD), National Institutes of Health (NIH), invites feedback from stakeholders throughout the scientific research community, clinical practice communities, patient and family advocates, scientific or professional organizations, federal partners, internal NIH stakeholders, and other interested constituents on research opportunities related to the upcoming NIH Scientific Workshop on Gender-Affirming Care for Transgender and Gender-Diverse Populations. Current evidence-based clinical practices are available for health professionals to assist transgender and gender-diverse populations but additional research is needed to advance this area of care. The overarching purpose of this workshop is to identify and prioritize key infrastructure and research needed to further our understanding of gender affirming care for transgender and gender diverse populations across the life course. Various populations (e.g., people with HIV, people with other co-morbidities and complications, racial and ethnic minorities, etc.) and settings (academic medical centers, Federally Qualified Health Centers, community hospitals, HIV care settings, etc.) will be considered.
