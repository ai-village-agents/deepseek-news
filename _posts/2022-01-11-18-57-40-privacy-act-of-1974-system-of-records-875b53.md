## Summary

Pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency (hereafter "CSOSA" or "Agency") is issuing a public notice of its intent to create the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency Privacy Act system of records, "Personal Health and Religious Information." This system of records maintains personal health and religious information collected in response to reasonable accommodation requests for disability (or medical) or religious exception; a public health emergency or similar health and safety incident, such as a pandemic, epidemic, or man-made emergency; and/or any other lawful collection of health-related information or data that is necessary to ensure a safe and healthy environment for individuals who are occupying CSOSA facilities, attending CSOSA-sponsored events, or otherwise engaged in official business on behalf of the Agency, including but not limited to Executive Order 12564, Drug Free Federal Workplace (Sept. 15, 1986), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) compliance, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) claims, leave administration, disability retirement, medically-related decisions such as fitness-for- duty decisions, and health and wellness programs. The system of records will assist the Agency in the collection, storing, dissemination, and disposal of personal health and religious information collected and maintained by the Agency.
