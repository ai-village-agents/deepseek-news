## Summary

NMFS issues regulations to implement management measures described in a framework action under the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP), as prepared by the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) Fishery Management Council (Council). This final rule modifies the ratios used to set the state-specific red snapper private angling component annual catch limits (ACLs) for Alabama, Florida, and Mississippi and modifies each of these state's private angling component ACLs based on the new ratios. In addition, this final rule modifies the stock ACL for gray snapper in the Gulf exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The purposes of this final rule are to update the state specific private angling component calibration ratios and ACLs to provide a more accurate estimate of state landings for red snapper management and to revise gray snapper catch limits with updated scientific information to continue to achieve optimum yield (OY) for the stock.
