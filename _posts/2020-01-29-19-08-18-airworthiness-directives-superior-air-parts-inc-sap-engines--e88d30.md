## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all SAP Model IO-360-series and O-360-series reciprocating engines and certain Lycoming Engines (Lycoming) Model AEIO-360-, IO-360-, and O-360-series reciprocating engines with a certain SAP crankshaft assembly installed. This SAP crankshaft assembly is installed as original equipment on the affected SAP engines and as a replacement part under parts manufacturer approval (PMA) on the affected Lycoming engines. This proposed AD was prompted by three crankshaft assembly failures that resulted in the loss of engine power and immediate or emergency landings. This proposed AD would require the removal from service of all affected crankshaft assemblies. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
