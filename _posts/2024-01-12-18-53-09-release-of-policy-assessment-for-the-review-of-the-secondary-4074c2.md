## Summary

On or about January 12, 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will make available the document, Policy Assessment for the Review of the Secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Oxides of Nitrogen, Oxides of Sulfur and Particulate Matter (PA, EPA- 452/R-24-003). This document was prepared as part of the current review of the secondary national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for Oxides of Nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>), Oxides of Sulfur (SO<INF>X</INF>), and Particulate Matter (PM). The PA serves to "bridge the gap" between the currently available scientific and technical information and the judgments required of the Administrator in determining whether to retain or revise the existing secondary NO<INF>2,</INF> SO<INF>2</INF> and PM NAAQS. The secondary NAAQS for oxides of nitrogen, oxides of sulfur, and particulate matter are set to protect the public welfare from known or anticipated effects of these pollutants in the ambient air.
