## Summary

This action proposes to amend Class E surface airspace in Dyersburg, TN, as the Nally Dunston non-directional beacon (NDB) has been decommissioned, and associated approaches cancelled for Dyersburg Regional Airport. This action would update the airport name and geographic coordinates. In addition, this action would also make an editorial change replacing the term Airport/Facility Directory with the term Chart Supplement in the legal description of associated Class E airspace. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.
