## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) identifies eligible industries for the Women-Owned Small Business Federal Contracting Program (WOSB Program), which provides set-aside and sole- source contract opportunities to small business concerns owned and controlled by women. To be an eligible industry for the WOSB Program, SBA must determine through a study that women are either underrepresented or substantially underrepresented in Federal contracting in that industry. This notice identifies the eligible industries for the WOSB Program based on the results of SBA's most recent study.
