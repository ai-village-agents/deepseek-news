## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Helicopters (Type Certificate previously held by Eurocopter France) Model AS350B3 and EC130T2 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of failure of an engine digital electronic control unit (DECU). This proposed AD would require revising the existing Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) for your helicopter. This proposed AD would also allow the option of modifying the electronic engine control unit (EECU) as terminating action for the RFM revision. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
