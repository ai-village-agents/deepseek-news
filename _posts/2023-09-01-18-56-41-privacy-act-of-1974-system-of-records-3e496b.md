## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC, Commission, or Agency) proposes to modify an existing system of records, FCC/CGB-4, internet-based Telecommunications Relay Service-User Registration Database (ITRS-URD) Program, subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. This action is necessary to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act to publish in the Federal Register notice of the existence and character of records maintained by the agency. The ITRS-URD's system of records contains personally identifiable information (PII) that is collected, used, stored, and maintained to support the administration, management, operations, and functions of the ITRS programs. The ITRS-URD, which is administered by a third party under contract with the FCC, is a database registration system that provides a necessary interface for multiple ITRS services, which include, but are not limited to Video Relay Service (VRS), and internet Protocol Captioned Telephone Service (IP CTS). These services are available to individuals who are deaf, deaf-blind, hard of hearing, or have speech disabilities, who are eligible under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and who register to participate in a TRS program. This modification makes various necessary changes and updates, including clarification of the purpose of the system, formatting changes required by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-108 since its previous publication, the addition of new routine uses, as well as the revision of existing routine uses.
