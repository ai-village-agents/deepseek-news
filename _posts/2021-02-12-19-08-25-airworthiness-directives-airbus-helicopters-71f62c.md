## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-19- 02, which applied to certain Airbus Helicopters (previously Eurocopter France) Model SA330J helicopters. AD 2020-19-02 required repetitively inspecting affected tail rotor (T/R) blades and depending on the inspection results, repairing or replacing the T/R blade. AD 2020-19-02 also prohibited installing an affected T/R blade unless it passed the inspections. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2020-19-02 and also clarifies the applicability, clarifies the affected T/R blades in the required actions, reduces a compliance time, and corrects the prohibition requirement. This AD was prompted by the determination that these corrections are necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
