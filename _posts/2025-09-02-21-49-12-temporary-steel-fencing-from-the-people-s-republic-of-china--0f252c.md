## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) published a notice in the Federal Register of August 19, 2025, in which Commerce announced the preliminary determination in the less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation of temporary steel fencing from the People's Republic of China (China). This notice corrects the inadvertent statement that critical circumstances exist for the separate rate companies and corrects the names of producers of certain separate rate companies.
