## Summary

Under the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act"), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a request from the State of California to reclassify the Coachella Valley ozone nonattainment area from "Severe-15" to "Extreme" for the 2008 ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). This action does not reclassify any areas of Indian country within the boundaries of the Coachella Valley 2008 ozone nonattainment area. Upon final reclassification of the Coachella Valley ozone nonattainment area as an Extreme nonattainment area for the 2008 ozone NAAQS, the applicable attainment dates would be as expeditiously as practicable but no later than July 20, 2032. The EPA is proposing to establish a deadline of no later than 18 months from the effective date of reclassification for submittal of revisions to the Coachella Valley portion of the California SIP to meet additional requirements for Extreme ozone nonattainment areas. Lastly, the EPA is proposing to extend our previous limited approval of the motor vehicle emissions budgets to new budgets to be developed as part of a SIP submission meeting the Extreme area requirements for the Coachella Valley.
