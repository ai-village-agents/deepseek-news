## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of 1,4-bis[[3-[2-(2- hydroxyethoxy)ethoxy]propyl]amino]-9,10-anthracenedione, when used as an inert ingredient (colorant/dye) on growing crops and raw agricultural commodities pre- and post-harvest in/on animals, limited to a maximum concentration of 0.5% in a pesticide formulation, and in antimicrobial formulations applied to food-contact surfaces in public eating places, dairy-processing equipment, and food-processing equipment and utensils not to exceed 300 ppm in the end-use concentration. Spring Regulatory Sciences on behalf of Colorants Solutions (new name Heubach Colorants USA LLC) submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of 1,4-bis[[3-[2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethoxy]propyl]amino]-9,10- anthracenedione, when used in accordance with the terms of those exemptions.
