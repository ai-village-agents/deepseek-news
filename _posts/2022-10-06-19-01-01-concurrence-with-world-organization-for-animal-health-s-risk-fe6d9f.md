## Summary

We are advising the public of our decision to concur with the World Organization for Animal Health's (WOAH's) bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) risk designation for Ireland. The WOAH recognizes Ireland as being of negligible risk for BSE. We are taking this action based on our review of information supporting the WOAH's risk designation for Ireland.
