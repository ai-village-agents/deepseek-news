## Summary

Notice is being given that the FAA is considering a request from Hancock County to change land use from aeronautical to non- aeronautical for 1.405 acres for non-aeronautical revenue generation at Hancock County Bar Harbor Airport, Trenton, ME. The parcel is not required for existing or future aviation development and is currently undeveloped. As such, the land use change will not affect the airport's future development needs, but will increase the airport's revenue stream over the term of the lease. The land lease proceeds will be deposited in the airport's operation and maintenance account.
