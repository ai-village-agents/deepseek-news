## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are extending the comment period on our July 3, 2023, proposed rule to list the dunes sagebrush lizard (Sceloporus arenicolus), a species found only in southeastern New Mexico and west Texas, as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). We are extending the proposed rule's comment period for 30 days to give all interested parties an additional opportunity to comment on the proposed rule. Comments previously submitted need not be resubmitted as they are already incorporated into the public record and will be fully considered in the final rule.
