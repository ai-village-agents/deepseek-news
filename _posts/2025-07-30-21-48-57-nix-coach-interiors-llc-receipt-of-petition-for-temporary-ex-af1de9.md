## Summary

NHTSA has received a request for a temporary exemption from Nix Coach Interiors, LLC, (petitioner) seeking a temporary exemption from a shoulder belt requirement of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 208, "Occupant crash protection," for side- facing seats on motorcoaches. The petitioner seeks an exemption to allow them to install Type 1 seat belts (lap belt only) at side-facing seating positions, instead of Type 2 seat belts (lap and shoulder belts) required by FMVSS No. 208. The petitioner states that, absent the requested exemption, it will otherwise be unable to sell a motor vehicle whose overall level of safety is equivalent to or exceeds the overall level of safety of non-exempted motor vehicles. NHTSA is publishing this document to notify the public of the receipt of the petition and to request comment on it, in accordance with statutory and administrative provisions.
