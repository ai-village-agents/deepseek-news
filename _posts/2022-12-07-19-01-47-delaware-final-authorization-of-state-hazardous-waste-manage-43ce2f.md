## Summary

The State of Delaware has applied to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). By this action, EPA proposes to grant final authorization to Delaware. In the "Rules and Regulations" section of this Federal Register, EPA is authorizing the revisions by a direct final rule. EPA did not make a proposal prior to the direct final rule because EPA believes this action is not controversial and does not expect comments that oppose it. EPA has explained the reasons for this authorization in the preamble to the direct final rule. Unless EPA receives written adverse comments pertaining to this State revision during the comment period, the direct final rule will become effective on the date it establishes, and EPA will not take further action on this proposed rulemaking. However, if EPA receives adverse comments pertaining to this State revision, EPA will publish a timely withdrawal in the Federal Register, and this direct final rule will not take effect. EPA will then respond to public comments in a later final rule based on this proposed rulemaking. You may not have another opportunity for comment. If you want to comment on this action, you must do so at this time.
