## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 ("PRA"), ONRR is proposing to renew an information collection. Currently, the information collection is authorized by the Office of Management and Budget ("OMB") under OMB Control Number 1012-0003, which expires on December 31, 2021. ONRR uses the information collected under this Information Collection Request ("ICR") both to review and approve delegation proposals from a State that is seeking to perform royalty management functions and to prepare a cooperative agreement with a State or Indian tribe seeking to perform royalty audits and investigations.
