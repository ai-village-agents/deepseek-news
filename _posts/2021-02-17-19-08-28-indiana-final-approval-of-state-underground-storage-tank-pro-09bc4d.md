## Summary

Pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA or Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to take direct final action to approve revisions to the State of Indiana's Underground Storage Tank (UST) program submitted by the State. This action is based on EPA's determination that the State's revisions satisfy all requirements needed for UST program approval. In the "Rules and Regulations" section of this Federal Register, EPA is approving the changes by direct final rule because we believe this action is not controversial and do not expect comments that oppose it.
