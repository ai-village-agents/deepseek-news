## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its spent fuel storage regulations by revising the NAC Multi-Purpose Canister (NAC-MPC) System listing within the "List of approved spent fuel storage casks" to include Amendment No. 9 and revise Amendment Nos. 6, 7, and 8 to Certificate of Compliance (CoC) No. 1025. The addition of Amendment No. 9 and the revisions to Amendment Nos. 6, 7, and 8 amend the description of the vertical concrete cask (VCC) in the CoC and technical specifications to make a distinction between the VCC body and the VCC lid, in terms of applicability of the American Concrete Institute (ACI) Specifications ACI 349 and ACI 318.
