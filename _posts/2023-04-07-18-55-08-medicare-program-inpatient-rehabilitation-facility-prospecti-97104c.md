## Summary

This proposed rule proposes updates to the prospective payment rates for inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs) for Federal fiscal year (FY) 2024. As required by statute, this proposed rule includes the proposed classification and weighting factors for the IRF prospective payment system's case-mix groups and a description of the methodologies and data used in computing the proposed prospective payment rates for FY 2024. It also proposes to rebase and revise the IRF market basket to reflect a 2021 base year. It also would modify the regulation regarding when IRF units can become excluded and paid under the IRF PPS. This proposed rule also includes updates for the IRF Quality Reporting Program (QRP).
