## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to reclassify the humpback chub (Gila cypha) from an endangered species to a threatened species on the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife, due to partial recovery. Based on the best available scientific and commercial data, threats to the humpback chub identified at the time of listing have been eliminated or reduced to the point that the species no longer meets the definition of an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), but is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future. We also propose a rule issued under section 4(d) of the Act that is necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation of the humpback chub.
