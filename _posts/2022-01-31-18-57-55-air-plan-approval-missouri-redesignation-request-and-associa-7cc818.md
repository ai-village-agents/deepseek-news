## Summary

On February 18, 2021, the State of Missouri submitted a request for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to redesignate the Jackson County, Missouri, 2010 1-hour sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) nonattainment area to attainment and approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision containing a maintenance plan for the area. The State provided a supplement to the maintenance plan on September 7, 2021. In response to these submittals, the EPA is taking the following final actions: Approve the State's plan for maintaining attainment of the 2010 1-hour SO<INF>2</INF> primary standard in the area; and approve the State's request to redesignate the Jackson County SO<INF>2</INF> nonattainment area to attainment for the 2010 1-hour SO<INF>2</INF> primary standard. This redesignation action addresses the EPA's obligation under a consent decree which establishes a deadline of March 31, 2022, for the EPA to determine under Clean Air Act (CAA) section 179(c) whether the Jackson County SO<INF>2</INF> nonattainment area attained the NAAQS by the October 4, 2018, attainment date.
