## Summary

The Video Division has before it a petition for rulemaking filed November 27, 2020 (Petition) by Gray Television Licensee, LLC (Petitioner), the licensee of KFVS-TV (CBS), channel 11 (KFVS or Station), Cape Girardeau, Missouri. The Petitioner requests the substitution of channel 32 for channel 11 at Cape Girardeau, Missouri in the DTV Table of Allotments. In support of its channel substitution request, the Petitioner states that the Commission has recognized that VHF channels have certain propagation characteristics which may cause reception issues for some viewers, and also that the "reception of VHF signals require larger antennas . . . relative to UHF channels." According to the Petitioner, "many of its viewers experience significant difficulty receiving KFVS-TV's signal" and its channel substitution proposal will allow KFVS "to deliver a more reliable over-the-air signal to viewers." The Petitioner further states that operation on channel 32 will not result in any predicted loss of service and would result in a substantial increase in signal receivability for KFVS viewers. We believe that the Petitioner's channel substitution proposal warrants consideration. Channel 32 can be substituted for channel 11 at Cape Girardeau, Missouri as proposed, in compliance with the principal community coverage requirements of the Commission's rules at coordinates 37-27-46.0 N and 89-30-14.0 W. In addition, we find that this channel change meets the technical requirements set forth in our regulations. We believe that the Petitioner's channel substitution proposal warrants consideration.
