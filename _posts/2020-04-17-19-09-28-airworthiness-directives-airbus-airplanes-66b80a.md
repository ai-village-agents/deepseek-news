## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; Model A319-111, - 112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, - 112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that cracks were detected on the left-hand (LH) and right-hand (RH) sides of the first rivet hole of the frame (FR) 43 foot coupling during scheduled maintenance. This proposed AD would require a rotating probe test of the fastener holes at FR43 on the LH and RH sides for any cracking, and on-condition actions if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which will be incorporated by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
