## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-1A10 and BD-700-1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports that main landing gear (MLG) trailing arm assemblies were found with compromised paint finish and corrosion on the axle bore inner diameters due to improper removal of contaminants during manufacturing. This AD requires a one-time inspection to determine if an affected MLG trailing arm assembly is installed, repetitive detailed inspections of the inner diameter of the affected MLG trailing arm assembly axle bore for surface finish discrepancies, corrective actions if necessary, and eventual replacement of primer and paint and application of corrosion preventive compound on the inner diameter of all affected MLG trailing arm assembly axle bores, which terminates the repetitive inspections. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
