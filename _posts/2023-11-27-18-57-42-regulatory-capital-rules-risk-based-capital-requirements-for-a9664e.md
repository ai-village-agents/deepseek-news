## Summary

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is adopting risk-based capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are significantly engaged in insurance activities. This risk-based capital framework, termed the Building Block Approach, adjusts and aggregates existing legal entity capital requirements to determine enterprise-wide capital requirements. The final rule also contains a risk-based capital requirement excluding insurance activities, in compliance with section 171 of The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Board also is adopting a reporting form FR Q-1 related to the Building Block Approach. The capital requirements and associated reporting form meet statutory mandates and will help to prevent the economic and consumer impacts resulting from the failure of organizations engaged in banking and insurance.
