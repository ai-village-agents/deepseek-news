## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to amend its recurring safety zone regulations in the Captain of the Port Sault Sainte Marie Zone. This proposed rule would update two safety zone locations and dates. This proposed amendment action is necessary to provide for the safety of life associated with annual marine events and firework displays on these navigable waters near Mackinaw City, MI, and Mackinac Island, MI. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the safety zones unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Sault Sainte Marie or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
