## Summary

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is focused on incentivizing more innovation, inclusively and in key technology areas such as artificial intelligence (AI) and other emerging technologies (ET) (e.g., quantum computing, synthetic biology, blockchain, precision medicine, and virtual reality), protecting that innovation and bringing it to impact to enhance our country's economic prosperity and national security and to solve world problems. In recent years, the USPTO has actively engaged its stakeholders regarding AI/ET. The USPTO has promoted the importance of intellectual property (IP) rights as an incentive to foster and protect innovation in these critical areas. To expand and scale these efforts, the USPTO seeks to form a partnership (AI/ET Partnership) with the AI and ET communities, including, for example, academia, independent inventors, small businesses, industry, other government agencies, nonprofits, and civil society. The AI/ET Partnership will provide an opportunity to bring stakeholders together through a series of engagements to share ideas, feedback, experiences, and insights on the intersection of IP and AI/ET. Through this notice, the USPTO announces a series of meetings exploring AI/ET-related initiatives at the USPTO and IP policy issues impacted by AI and other ET.
