## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing a limited approval and limited disapproval of a revision to the Amador Air District's (AAD or "District") portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). This revision governs the District's issuance of permits for stationary sources, and focuses on the preconstruction review and permitting of major sources and major modifications under part D of title I of the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act"). Under the authority of the CAA, this action simultaneously approves a local rule that regulates these emission sources and directs the District to correct rule deficiencies.
