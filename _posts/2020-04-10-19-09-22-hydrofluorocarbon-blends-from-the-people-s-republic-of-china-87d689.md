## Summary

The Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily determines that certain hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) blends, containing HFC components from India and the People's Republic of China (China), that are blended in India prior to importation into the United States, are circumventing the antidumping duty (AD) order on HFC blends from China. As a result, imports of HFC blends, containing HFC components from India and China, that are blended in India prior to importation into the United States, will be subject to suspension of liquidation effective June 18, 2019. We invite interested parties to comment on this preliminary determination.
