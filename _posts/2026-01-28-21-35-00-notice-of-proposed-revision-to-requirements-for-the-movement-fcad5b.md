## Summary

We are advising the public that we have prepared a pest risk analysis relative to the interstate movement of fresh Persian lime fruit (Citrus latifolia (Yu. Tanaka) Tanaka) for consumption into the continental United States. The interstate movement of fresh Persian lime fruit from Hawaii into the continental United States is currently authorized, provided that the limes are either subject to forced hot air treatment or irradiation. Based on the findings of the risk analysis, we are also proposing to authorize the interstate movement of fresh Persian lime fruit for consumption from Hawaii under a systems approach as an alternative to the current mitigation structures. We are making the pest risk analysis available to the public for review and comment.
