## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to grant authorization to the State of Wyoming for the changes to its hazardous waste program under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended, commonly referred to as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The EPA has determined that these changes satisfy all requirements needed to qualify for final authorization and is authorizing the State's changes through a direct final action, which can be found in the "Rules and Regulations" section of this Federal Register. In addition, the EPA is proposing to codify in the regulations entitled, "Hazardous Waste Rules and Regulations, Chapter 1, General Provisions," Wyoming's authorized hazardous waste program. The EPA will incorporate by reference into the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) those provisions of the State regulations that are authorized and that the EPA will enforce under RCRA.
