## Summary

This rule makes changes to the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-raised Fish Program (ELAP) to assist producers with the cost of transporting feed to livestock intended for grazing and the cost of transporting livestock intended for grazing to feed. This rule amends the definition of "eligible drought" to cover situations in which any area of a county has been rated by the U.S. Drought Monitor as having a D2 (severe drought) intensity for at least 8 consecutive weeks, which will expand the availability of drought assistance for water transportation and honey bee feed losses. It also removes the restriction on providing assistance for transportation of water to livestock located on land enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP).
