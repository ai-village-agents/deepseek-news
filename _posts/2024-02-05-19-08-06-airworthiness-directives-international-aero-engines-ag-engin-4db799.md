## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain International Aero Engines, AG (IAE AG) Model V2500 engines. This proposed AD was prompted by an analysis of an event involving an International Aero Engines, LLC (IAE LLC) Model PW1127GA- JM engine, which experienced a high-pressure compressor (HPC) 7th-stage integrally bladed rotor (IBR-7) separation that resulted in an aborted takeoff. This proposed AD would require performing an angled ultrasonic inspection (AUSI) of certain high-pressure turbine (HPT) 1st-stage hubs and HPT 2nd-stage hubs for cracks and replacing if necessary. This proposed AD would also require accelerated replacement of certain HPT 1st-stage hubs and HPT 2nd-stage hubs. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
