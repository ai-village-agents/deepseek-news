## Summary

American innovation is a cornerstone of our strong, vibrant economy, with robust development of emerging and early-stage innovation spurring entrepreneurship and other economic activity. Intellectual property (IP) forms the bridge that moves innovation to impact for the benefit of society. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO, or the Agency) is committed to supporting translation of innovations to the marketplace through commercialization and is seeking public comment on how the agency can build on current initiatives to advance this commitment. The USPTO, with support from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the National Science Foundation (NSF), seeks input on new ways to unlock the potential of intellectual property for the public good by fostering pathways for innovation to reach the marketplace, with particular attention to green, critical, and emerging technologies.
