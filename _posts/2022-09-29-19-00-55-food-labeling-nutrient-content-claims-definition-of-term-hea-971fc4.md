## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is proposing to update the definition for the implied nutrient content claim "healthy" to be consistent with current nutrition science and Federal dietary guidance, especially the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (Dietary Guidelines), regarding how consumers can maintain healthy dietary practices. This action, if finalized, will revise the requirements for when the term "healthy" can be used as an implied claim in the labeling of human food products to indicate that a food's level of nutrients may help consumers maintain healthy dietary practices by helping them achieve a total diet that conforms to dietary recommendations.
