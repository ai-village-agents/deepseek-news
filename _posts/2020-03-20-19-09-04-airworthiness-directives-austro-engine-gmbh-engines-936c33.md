## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Austro Engine GmbH model E4 and E4P diesel piston engines. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of considerable wear of the timing chain and failure of fuel injectors on these engines. This proposed AD would require replacement of the timing chain and fuel injectors on the affected Austro Engine GmbH model E4 and E4P diesel piston engines. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
