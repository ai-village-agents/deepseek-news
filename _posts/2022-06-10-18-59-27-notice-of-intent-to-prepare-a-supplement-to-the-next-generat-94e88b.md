## Summary

On January 7, 2022, the Postal Service published a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) pursuant to the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), its implementing regulations, and the President's Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations for its Next Generation Delivery Vehicle (NGDV) Acquisitions. On February 23, 2022, the Postal Service issued its Record of Decision, determining that it would implement the NGDV FEIS's Preferred Alternative to purchase and deploy over a ten-year period 50,000 to 165,000 purpose-built, right-hand drive NGDV consisting of a mix of internal combustion engine (ICE) and battery electric vehicle (BEV) powertrains, with at least ten percent BEVs. On March 24, 2022, in accordance with that decision, the Postal Service placed an order for 50,000 NGDV, of which 10,019 are BEV. The Postal Service now announces its intention to prepare a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) to address the three considerations that have developed since the NGDV FEIS and Record of Decision.
