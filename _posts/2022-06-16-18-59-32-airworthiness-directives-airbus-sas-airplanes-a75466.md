## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-16-03, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and - 1041 airplanes. AD 2021-16-03 requires an inspection for missing or incorrect application of the lightning strike edge glow sealant protection at certain locations in the wing tanks, and corrective action. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-16-03, a modification was developed to restore two independent layers of lightning strike protection on the wing upper cover. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions of AD 2021-16-03 and would require a modification to restore two independent layers of lightning strike protection, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
