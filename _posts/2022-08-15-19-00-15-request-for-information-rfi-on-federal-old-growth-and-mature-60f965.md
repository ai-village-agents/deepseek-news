## Summary

On July 15, 2022, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), United States Forest Service (Forest Service), and the United States Department of the Interior (DOI), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), published in the Federal Register a document entitled "Request for Information (RFI) on Federal Old-growth and Mature Forests" and invited public comments to inform the response to Executive Order Strengthening the Nation's Forests, Communities, and Local Economies which requires USDA and DOI to define old-growth and mature forests on Federal lands; complete an inventory and make it publicly available; coordinate conservation and wildfire risk reduction activities; identify threats to mature and old-growth forests; develop policies to address threats; develop Agency-specific reforestation goals by 2030; develop climate-informed reforestation plans; and develop recommendations for community-led local and regional economic development opportunities. In response to requests by prospective commenters that they would benefit from additional time to adequately consider and respond to the RFI, USDA Forest Service and DOI Bureau of Land Management have determined that an extension of the comment period until August 30, 2022, is appropriate.
