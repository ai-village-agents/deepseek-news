## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is approving revisions to the Texas State Implementation Plan (SIP) that pertain to the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB) area and the 1979 1-hour and 1997 8- hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS or standard). The EPA is approving the plan for maintaining the 1-hour and 1997 ozone NAAQS through the year 2032 in the HGB area. The EPA is determining that the HGB area continues to attain the 1979 1-hour and 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS and has met the five CAA criteria for redesignation. Therefore, the EPA is terminating all anti-backsliding obligations for the HGB area for the 1-hour and 1997 ozone NAAQS. The EPA is also approving the Texas Severe Ozone Nonattainment Area Failure to Attain Fee regulations for the HGB area as an equivalent alternative program to address section 185 of the CAA for the 1-hour ozone NAAQS.
