## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing approval, and a limited approval and limited disapproval of a revision to the Antelope Valley Air Quality Management District (AVAQMD or "District") portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). The EPA is proposing to take action on nine rules submitted on August 3, 2021. We are proposing approval of three rules, and limited approval and limited disapproval of six rules. These revisions concern the District's New Source Review (NSR) permitting program for new and modified sources of air pollution under part D of title I of the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act"). If finalized, this action will update the AVAQMD's current SIP with nine revised rules. We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
