## Summary

The National Indian Gaming Commission proposes to amend its regulations to add definitions, amend existing definitions, and amend requirements for conducting background investigations and issuing licenses. Proposed amendments include adding general managers and other persons with similar management responsibility to the primary management official definition; limiting the definition to those with duties similar to those of a chief financial officer rather than persons who have financial management responsibility; and limiting primary management officials to employed management officials designated by Tribes instead of any person so designated. The proposed amendments to the key employee definition consolidate certain of its subsections; include gaming operation employees authorized for unescorted access to secured areas that are designated as such by Tribal gaming regulatory authorities; remove compensation as determinative factor with the exception of the four most highly compensated persons in the gaming operation; and allow Tribes to designate any other employee of the gaming enterprise as a key employee instead of "any other person." Other proposed amendments incorporate the addition definitions for Gaming Enterprise and Tribal Gaming Regulatory Authority and clarify licensing application and background investigation retention. Specifically, the proposed amendments focus on licensing of primary management officials and key employees instead of employment of them; adding notification requirements for licensing revocation decisions; specifying retention requirements of information and documentation post termination; and changing the vesting of a right to a hearing to reflect Tribal law and policy.
