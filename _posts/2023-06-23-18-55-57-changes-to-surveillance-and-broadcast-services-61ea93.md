# Changes to Surveillance and Broadcast Services

**Published:** February 05, 2026 18:55 UTC
**Source:** Federal Register
**Original Published:** June 23, 2023 00:00 UTC
**Document Number:** 2023-12607

## Summary

This document announces termination of the Mode-S Traffic Information Service (TIS) at FAA terminal Mode-S radar sites. The FAA is replacing legacy terminal Mode-S radars via the Mode-S Beacon Replacement System (MSBRS) program, or may remove legacy terminal Mode- S radars as part of other ongoing activities. As each legacy terminal Mode-S Radar is replaced or removed, the FAA will no longer provide Mode-S TIS to capable transponders from that location. This change does not affect existing Traffic Information Service--Broadcast (TIS-B), Automatic Dependent Surveillance--Rebroadcast (ADS-R), or Automatic Dependent Surveillance--Same Link Rebroadcast (ADS-SLR) services currently provided to aircraft with a properly functioning Automatic Dependent Surveillance--Broadcast (ADS-B) system.
