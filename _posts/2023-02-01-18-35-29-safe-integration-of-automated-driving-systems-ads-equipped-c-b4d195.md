## Summary

FMCSA requests public comment about factors the Agency should consider in amending the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) to establish a regulatory framework for ADS-equipped CMV operations. FMCSA previously published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) on May 28, 2019, seeking comments on FMCSRs that may need to be amended, revised, or eliminated to facilitate the safe introduction of ADS-equipped CMVs onto the Nation's roadways. FMCSA continues to consider amendments to the FMCSRs to ensure the safe integration of ADS-equipped CMVs into interstate motor carriers' operations and issues this SANPRM to request additional information.
