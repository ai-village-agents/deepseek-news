## Summary

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) announces publication and serves as Notice for the extramural community on recent policy changes made for the Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) and the Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR). This Notice implements additional disclosure requirements and post-award reporting requirements for small business concerns (SBCs) for covered relationships. In addition, this serves as notification of NIH's due diligence program to assess security risks and denial of award when foreign relationships or commitments with countries of concern pose a significant risk as provided in the SBIR and STTR Extension Act of 2022 at https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ183/PLAW-117publ183.pdf under these programs. This policy serves as an update to section 18. Grants to For Profit Organizations of the NIH Grants Policy Statement (GPS) at https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/HTML5/section_18/ 18_grants_to_for-profit_organizations.htm and will be incorporated in the FY24 publication. In addition, the NIH Application Guide will be updated to reflect instructions for submission of required documentation.
