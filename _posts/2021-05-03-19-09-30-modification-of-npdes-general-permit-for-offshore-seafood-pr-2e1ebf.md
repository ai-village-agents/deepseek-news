## Summary

The Director, Water Division, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 10, is modifying a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) General Permit for offshore seafood processors operating in federal waters off the coast of Alaska. The permit, which became effective on July 17, 2019, authorizes discharges of seafood processing waste from vessels that: discharge at least 3 nautical miles (NM) or greater from the Alaska shore; and, which engage in the processing of fresh, frozen, canned, smoked, salted or pickled seafood, the processing of mince, or the processing of meal, paste and other secondary by-products. On March 30, 2020,the Freezer Longline Coalition (FLC) requested that EPA modify the permit to allow for a currently-prohibited seasonal discharge (between June 10 and December 31, the fleet's "B Season") within 1 NM of wintering critical habitat (Unit 5) for the spectacled eider. EPA has decided to modify the permit to allow for seasonal discharge (between June 10 and December 31) within 1 NM of wintering critical habitat (Unit 5) for the spectacled eider (Part III.B.7 of the modified general permit). All other conditions of the permit remain unchanged. Between March 1 and March 31, 2021, EPA accepted comments on the proposed modification. Only the conditions subject to modification were reopened for public comment. EPA received a single comment letter from the FLC. The comments were non-significant and supported the proposed modification; therefore, EPA is not required to prepare a Response to Comments document.
