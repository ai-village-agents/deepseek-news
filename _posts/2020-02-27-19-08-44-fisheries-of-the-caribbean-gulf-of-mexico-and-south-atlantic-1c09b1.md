## Summary

NMFS implements management measures described in Vision Blueprint Recreational Regulatory Amendment 26 (Regulatory Amendment 26) to the Fishery Management Plan for the Snapper-Grouper Fishery of the South Atlantic Region (Snapper-Grouper FMP), as prepared and submitted by the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council). For the recreational sector, this final rule removes the minimum size limits for queen snapper, silk snapper, and blackfin snapper, reduces the minimum size limit for gray triggerfish in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off the east coast of Florida, and modifies the 20-fish snapper-grouper aggregate bag limit. The purpose of this final rule is to minimize regulatory discards to the extent practicable, improve regulatory compliance among fishers, and increase consistency among regulations.
