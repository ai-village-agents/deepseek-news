## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is proposing to amend our standard of identity (SOI) regulations that specify salt (sodium chloride) as a required or optional ingredient to permit the use of salt substitutes in standardized foods, to reduce the sodium content. Reducing sodium may help reduce the risk of hypertension, a leading cause of heart disease and stroke. The proposed rule, if finalized, would help support a healthier food supply by providing flexibility to facilitate industry innovation in the production of standardized foods lower in sodium while maintaining the basic nature and essential characteristics of the foods.
