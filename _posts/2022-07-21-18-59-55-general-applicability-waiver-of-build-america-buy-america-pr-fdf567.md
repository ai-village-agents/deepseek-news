## Summary

In accordance with the Build America, Buy America Act ("BABA") this notice advises that the Department of Energy ("DOE" or the "Department") is proposing a limited general applicability waiver ("Waiver") to the Buy America Domestic Content Procurement Preference (as defined below) requirements of the Act. The Waiver will be effective for 180 days after its issuance (the "Effective Period") and will apply only to awards issued as a result of Funding Opportunity Announcements ("FOA") released before May 14, 2022 ("applicable awards"). This Waiver will be effective solely with respect to applicable awards signed during the Effective Period; it will not apply to applicable awards signed before or after the Effective Period. Applicable Awards subject to this Waiver will not be required to incorporate the Buy America Preference, which mandates that all iron, steel, manufactured goods, and construction materials used in the award be manufactured domestically. DOE is seeking public comment as to whether this proposed Waiver is in the public interest, as it will provide the Department and its stakeholders a reasonable adjustment period to implement BABA in a more thorough, effective, and exacting manner.
