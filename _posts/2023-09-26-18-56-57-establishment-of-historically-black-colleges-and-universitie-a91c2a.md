## Summary

As required by the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is giving notice that it is establishing the Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Serving Institutions Advisory Council. The purpose of this committee is to provide advice and recommendations to the EPA Administrator on critical policy and technical issues to advance equity in economic and social opportunities for all Americans and strengthen the capacity of HBCUs and MSIs to provide the highest- quality education, participate in and benefit from federal programs, and support key Administration policies. The EPA has determined that this federal advisory committee is necessary and in the public interest to provide critical advice and recommendations to assist the EPA in increasing outreach to underrepresented and underserved communities by developing a stronger partnership with HBCUs and MSIs.
