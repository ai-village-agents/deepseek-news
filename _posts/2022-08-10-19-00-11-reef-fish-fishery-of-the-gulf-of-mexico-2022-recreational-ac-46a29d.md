## Summary

NMFS implements an accountability measure (AM) for the red grouper recreational sector in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) for the 2022 fishing year through this temporary rule. NMFS has projected that the 2022 recreational annual catch target (ACT) for Gulf red grouper will have been reached by August 30, 2022. Therefore, NMFS closes the recreational sector for Gulf red grouper on August 30, 2022, and it will remain closed through the end of the fishing year on December 31, 2022. This closure is necessary to protect the Gulf red grouper resource.
