# Airworthiness Directives; Dassault Aviation Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Dassault Aviation Model FALCON 7X airplanes and Model FALCON 2000EX airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that non-certified ANCRA seat tracks were installed on some airplanes and that those seat tracks might not sustain required loads during an emergency landing. This proposed AD would require replacement of certain ANCRA seat tracks with certified (Brownline) seat tracks, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
