## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is conducting an administrative review of the countervailing duty (CVD) order on quartz surface products (QSP) from India for the period October 11, 2019, through December 31, 2020. Commerce preliminarily determines that Divyashakti Granites Ltd. (DSG), the sole producer/exporter of QSP from India subject to this review, received countervailable subsidies. In addition, we are also rescinding this review with regard to 23 companies for which the request for review was timely withdrawn by interested parties.
