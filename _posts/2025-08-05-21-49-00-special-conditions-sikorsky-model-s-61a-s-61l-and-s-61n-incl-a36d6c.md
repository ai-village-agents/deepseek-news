## Summary

These special conditions are issued for Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation and Sikorsky Aircraft (Sikorsky) Model S-61A, S-61L, and S- 61N helicopters. These helicopters, as modified by Carson Helicopters Inc. (Carson), will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport category rotorcraft. This design feature is an overload protection device (OLPD) installed in the hoist. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
