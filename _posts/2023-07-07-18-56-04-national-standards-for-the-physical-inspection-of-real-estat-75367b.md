## Summary

This notice serves as a complementary document to the Economic Growth Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act: Implementation of National Standards for the Physical Inspection of Real Estate (NSPIRE) rule published May 11, 2023. The NSPIRE rule provides that HUD will publish in the Federal Register the NSPIRE inspection standards and scoring methodology to assess the overall condition, health, and safety of properties and units assisted or insured by HUD. The NSPIRE Standards were published for public comment on June 17, 2022 and posted as final on June 22, 2023. On March 28, 2023, HUD published a proposed scoring methodology for public comment. HUD establishes with this notice the NSPIRE physical inspection scoring and ranking methodology to implement HUD's NSPIRE rule for Public Housing and Multifamily Housing programs, including Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance (PBRA) and other Multifamily assisted housing, Section 202/811 programs, and HUD-insured Multifamily as described in the NSPIRE rule. The scoring methodology converts observed defects into a numerical score and sets a threshold for HUD to perform additional administrative oversight by establishing a level for when a property fails an inspection (less than 60 points) and when an enforcement referral is automatic or required (less than or equal to 30 points).
