## Summary

This advance notice of proposed rulemaking solicits public comment on potential options we may consider for Medicare participating hospitals to help foster a more resilient supply chain for American- made personal protective equipment and essential medicines to secure our nation's health and safety and to reflect the additional resource costs incurred when procuring these domestically manufactured items. We seek input on a possible new "Secure American Medical Supplies" friendly designation that could be earned by hospitals that demonstrate their commitment to domestic procurement. In addition, we seek input on potential ways such a designation could facilitate the creation of new, streamlined payment policies to support hospitals in their efforts. We are also seeking input on a potential new structural quality measure as part of the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (IQR) Program that could promote hospital commitments to invest in domestic procurement to secure our nation's health and safety.
