## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing the Contaminant Candidate List (CCL) which is a list of contaminants in drinking water that are currently not subject to any proposed or promulgated national primary drinking water regulations. In addition, these contaminants are known or anticipated to occur in public water systems and may require regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). This list is the Fifth Contaminant Candidate List (CCL 5) published by the agency since the SDWA amendments of 1996. CCL 5 includes 66 chemicals, 3 chemical groups (cyanotoxins, disinfection byproducts (DBPs), and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)), and 12 microbial contaminants.
