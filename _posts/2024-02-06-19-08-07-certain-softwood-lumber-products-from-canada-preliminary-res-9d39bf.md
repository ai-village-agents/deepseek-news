## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping duty (AD) order on certain softwood lumber products (softwood lumber) from Canada. The period of review (POR) is January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2022. Commerce preliminarily determines that the producers/exporters subject to this review made sales of subject merchandise at less than normal value. In addition, with respect to Smartlam LLC (Smartlam), we are preliminarily rescinding this administrative review because Smartlam did not have any reviewable entries of subject merchandise during the POR. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.
