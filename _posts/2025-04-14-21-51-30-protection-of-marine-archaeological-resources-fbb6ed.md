## Summary

Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress passed, and the President signed, a joint resolution disapproving the final "Protection of Marine Archaeology Resources" rule published by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) on September 3, 2024. That rule required lessees and operators to submit an archaeological report with any oil and gas exploration or development plan they submit to BOEM for approval of proposed activities on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Under the joint resolution and by operation of the Congressional Review Act, the "Protection of Marine Archaeological Resources" rule has no force or effect.
