## Summary

This action proposes to amend eleven VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways, V-13, V-15, V-26, V-55, V-78, V-100, V-159, V- 175, V-219, V-307, and V-505, and two low altitude Area Navigation (RNAV) routes, T-285 and T-354, in the Northcentral United States. The modifications are necessary due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Park Rapids, MN, VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/ DME); Siren, WI, VOR/DME; Sioux City, IA, VOR/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC); and Huron, SD, VORTAC navigation aids (NAVAIDs). The NAVAIDs provide navigation guidance for portions of the affected air traffic service (ATS) routes. The VORs are being decommissioned as part of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
