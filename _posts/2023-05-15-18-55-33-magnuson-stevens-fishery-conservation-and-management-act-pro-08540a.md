## Summary

The Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council has submitted the Black Sea Bass Commercial State Allocation Amendment (Amendment 23) to the Summer Flounder, Scup, and Black Sea Bass Fishery Management Plan (FMP). Amendment 23 proposes to establish commercial state-by-state black sea bass allocations in the Federal fishery management plan and regulations, to change the trigger for the in-season closure accountability measures, and change the state-overage payback. Amendment 23 is intended to address the allocation-related impacts of the significant changes in the distribution of black sea bass that have occurred since the original allocations were implemented.
