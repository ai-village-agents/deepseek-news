## Summary

The United States Postal Service[supreg] (USPS[supreg]) is proposing to modify one General Privacy Act System of Records (SOR) to support a resilient, modern, and flexible Fleet Management Information System (FMIS) for the USPS fleet. An Integrated Fleet Management (IFM) solution, that includes both Telematics system technology and a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) FMIS, will improve the effectiveness and efficiency of USPS Fleet Management capabilities to better meet future challenges and needs, by providing real time vehicle maintenance and operational data to fleet managers. Telematics uses onboard vehicle technologies, including instruments and sensors, to track and combine maintenance and operational data, that is subsequently transmitted to a central database for fleet management purposes.
