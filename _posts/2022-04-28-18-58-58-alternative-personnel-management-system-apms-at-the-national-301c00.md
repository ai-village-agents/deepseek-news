## Summary

This notice modifies the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Alternative Personnel Management System (APMS) published October 21, 1997 to allow NIST to implement a term appointment with a minimum duration of more than one year that may be extended up to six years, for research positions in the Scientific and Engineering (ZP) career path at the Pay Band III-level and above. These term appointments will be subject to a trial period that lasts the duration of the term (initial appointment including any subsequent extensions). This notice also modifies the APMS to allow NIST to convert an employee serving under a term appointment under this authority to a permanent appointment in the competitive service without further competition.
