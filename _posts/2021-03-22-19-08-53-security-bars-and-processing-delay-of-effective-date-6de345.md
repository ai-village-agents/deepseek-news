## Summary

On December 23, 2020, the Department of Homeland Security ("DHS") and the Department of Justice ("DOJ") (collectively, "the Departments") published a final rule ("Security Bars rule") to clarify that the "danger to the security of the United States" standard in the statutory bar to eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal encompasses certain emergency public health concerns and to make certain other changes; that rule was scheduled to take effect on January 22, 2021. As of January 21, 2021, the Departments delayed the rule's effective date for 60 days to March 22, 2021. In this rule, the Departments are further extending and delaying the rule's effective date to December 31, 2021. In addition, in light of evolving information regarding the best approaches to mitigating the spread of communicable disease, the Departments are also considering action to rescind or revise the Security Bars rule. The Departments are seeking public comment on whether that rule represents an effective way to protect public health while reducing barriers for noncitizens seeking forms of protection in the United States, or whether the Security Bars rule should be revised or revoked.
