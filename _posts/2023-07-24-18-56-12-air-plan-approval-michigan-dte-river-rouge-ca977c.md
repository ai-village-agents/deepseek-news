## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a request submitted by the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) on January 12, 2023, and supplemented on April 19, 2023, to revise the Michigan state implementation plan (SIP) for particulate matter (PM). The revision updates the fugitive dust plan for Detroit Edison--River Rouge Power Plant (DTE Energy) located in River Rouge, Michigan. The facility is no longer in operation and therefore, the plan eliminates requirements to reflect plant shut down.
