## Summary

The FAA is correcting an airworthiness directive (AD) that was published in the Federal Register. That AD applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. As published, a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD number specified in the regulatory text is incorrect. This document corrects that error. In all other respects, the original document remains the same.
