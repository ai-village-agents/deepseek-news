## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily finds that Saffron Living Co., Ltd. (Saffron), did not make a bona fide sale of a mattress from Thailand during the period of review (POR) November 3, 2020, through April 30, 2022. Therefore, Commerce intends to rescind this administrative review with respect to Saffron. Additionally, we are rescinding this review with respect to Nisco (Thailand) Co., Ltd. (Nisco) because it timely withdrew its administrative review request, and no other party requested a review of the company. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.
