## Summary

The Commission has before it a petition for rulemaking filed by KTUL Licensee, LLC, (Licensee), licensee of KTUL, channel 10, Tulsa, Oklahoma, requesting the substitution of channel 14 for channel 10 at Tulsa in the DTV Table of Allotments. The Licensee states that the Commission has recognized that VHF channels have certain propagation characteristics which may cause reception issues for some viewers, and also that reception of VHF signals require larger antennas that are generally not well suited to the mobile applications expected under flexible use, relative to UHF channels. KTUL has received numerous complaints from viewers unable to receive the Station's over-the-air signal, despite being able to receive signals from other stations. Licensee further states that with respect to operations on channel 14 and nearby land mobile services, it has determined that it can install the appropriate mask filter and antenna needed to avoid interference to land mobile operations. In addition, operation on channel 14 will not result in any predicted loss of service and would result in a substantial increase in signal receivability for KTUL viewers.
