## Summary

Through this notice, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announces that the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) is terminating the designation of Ethiopia for Temporary Protected Status. The designation of Ethiopia is set to expire on December 12, 2025. After reviewing country conditions and consulting with appropriate U.S. Government agencies, the Secretary determined that Ethiopia no longer continues to meet the conditions for the designation for Temporary Protected Status. The Secretary, therefore, is terminating the Temporary Protected Status designation of Ethiopia as required by statute. This termination is effective February 13, 2026. After February 13, 2026, nationals of Ethiopia (and aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in Ethiopia) who have been granted Temporary Protected Status under Ethiopia's designation will no longer have Temporary Protected Status.
