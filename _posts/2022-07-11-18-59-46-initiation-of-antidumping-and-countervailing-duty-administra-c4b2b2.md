## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) published notices in the Federal Register of July 6, 2021, and June 6, 2022, respectively, in which Commerce announced the initiation and preliminary results and partial rescission of the 2020-2021 administrative review of the antidumping duty (AD) order on certain carbon and alloy steel cut-to-length plate (CTL Plate) from Belgium. In these notices, Commerce inadvertently misspelled the company name of NLMK Verona SpA, a company for which we initiated and subsequently rescinded an administrative review.
