## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A321-251N, A321-251NX, A321-252N, A321-252NX, A321-253N, and A321-253NX airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a stress analysis on the engine structure that indicated that the fail- safe lug may not be able to sustain, during one inspection interval as currently specified in an airworthiness limitations item, the loads deriving from the engagement of the secondary load path within that inspection interval for the aft engine mount system. This proposed AD would require repetitive detailed inspections of the aft engine mount and secondary load path clearance fail-safe pin and replacement of the engine if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
