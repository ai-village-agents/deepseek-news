## Summary

The FAA is withdrawing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) and supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) that proposed to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 92-13-04 for certain Piper Aircraft Corporation (now Piper Aircraft, Inc.) (Piper) Model PA-23-150 (type certificated as PA-23) and PA-23-160 airplanes. AD 92-13-04 requires preflight water draining procedures for the fuel tanks on the affected airplanes. In June 2022, the FAA calculated the quantitative risk using current methods, which were not available at the time the NPRM and SNPRM were issued. The short- and long-term risk assessment calculations establish that an AD for the additional actions and the additional airplane models that were proposed to be added in the NPRM and SNPRM is not warranted. Accordingly, the NPRM and SNPRM are withdrawn.
