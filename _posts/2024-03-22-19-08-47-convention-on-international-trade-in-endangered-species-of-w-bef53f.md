## Summary

To implement the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES or the Convention), the Parties to the Convention meet periodically to review what species in international trade should be regulated as well as other aspects of CITES implementation. The twentieth regular meeting of the Conference of the Parties (CoP20) is tentatively scheduled to be held in the second half of 2025. The specific date and location of CoP20 are yet to be determined. With this notice, we are soliciting recommendations to amend Appendices I and II of CITES at CoP20 as well as recommendations for resolutions, decisions, and agenda items for discussion at CoP20. We invite you to provide us with information and recommendations on animal and plant species for which the United States should consider submitting proposals to amend Appendices I and II. Such proposals may concern the addition of species to Appendix I or Appendix II, the transfer of species from one Appendix to another, or the removal of species from the Appendices. We also invite you to provide us with information and recommendations on resolutions, decisions, and agenda items that the United States might consider submitting for discussion at CoP20. Finally, with this notice, we also describe the United States' approach to preparations for CoP20.
