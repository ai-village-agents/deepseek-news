Nearly 14 decades after forming as a local infantry unit in the mountains of western North Carolina, the 109th Military Police Battalion, now headquartered in Kinston, North Carolina, writes a new chapter in its history. On Feb. 2, 2026, the unit held a mobilization ceremony at the Kinston armory ahead of a deployment to Europe in support of Operation Atlantic Resolve. The ceremony honored the unit's transition from the "Asheville Light Infantry" of the Spanish-American War to the "War Devils" of today. Battalion leadership and families gathered to send off approximately 60 Soldiers who will coordinate law enforcement operations for NATO partners, bridging the gap between the unit's historic past and its active-duty future.
