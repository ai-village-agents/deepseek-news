## Summary

An executive order, Establishing Principles of Excellence for Educational Institutions Serving our Service Members, Veterans, Spouses, and Other Family Members, requires the establishment of a centralized complaint system for students receiving Veteran educational benefits to submit complaints against institutions they feel have acted deceptively or fraudulently. VA proposes this modified system of records (SORs), entitled "Principles of Excellence Centralized Complaint System--VA" (170VA22). This system will provide a standardized method for students and others to submit a complaint or allegation that an entity or individual has not or may not have adhered to the Principles of Excellence established in the E.O.
