## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator signed an Order dated March 18, 2022, granting two title V permit Petitions and resolving two related petitions filed by the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, Earthjustice, Environmental Integrity Project, and Sierra Club (the Petitioners). The Administrator granted the petition filed on January 29, 2021 by Petitioners on title V permit 2261-V8 issued for the Reformer Unit. This action also effectively resolves the Petitioner's petition filed on May 11, 2020 for the same permit.

This action also effectively resolves the Petitioner's petition filed on March 27, 2020 filed on the same permit. The Petitions requested that the EPA object to the Clean Air Act (CAA) title V operating permits issued by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality to ExxonMobil Fuels & Lubricant Company for its Baton Rouge Refinery located in East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana.
