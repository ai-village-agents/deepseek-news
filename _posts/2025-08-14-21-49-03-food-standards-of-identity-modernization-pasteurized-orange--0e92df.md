## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is correcting the proposed rule entitled "Food Standards of Identity Modernization; Pasteurized Orange Juice; Proposed Rule" (90 FR 37817, August 6, 2025). In the proposed rule, FDA proposed to amend the standard of identity (SOI) for pasteurized orange juice (POJ) by lowering the minimum orange juice soluble solids content from 10.5[deg] to 10[deg] Brix. The proposed rule inadvertently included an additional summary of benefits table, an additional summary table and an extraneous paragraph and sentence. This document corrects those errors.
