## Summary

On December 23, 2022, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a direct final rule in the Federal Register to approve revisions to the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act") Operating Permit Program (title V) of the San Diego County Air Pollution Control District (SDCAPCD or "District") in California. In that rulemaking, the EPA included an incorrect effective date in Section VI of the document and in the instructions to amend the regulatory text. This document corrects the errors in the direct final rule.
