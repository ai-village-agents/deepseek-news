## Summary

The Department of Labor (DOL) is proposing to revise the Department of Labor Acquisition Regulations (DOLAR), in its entirety in order to update and streamline agency procurement regulations consistent with the Federal Acquisition Reform Act, and the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act. The proposed updates remove provisions that are redundant or obsolete and codify the use of certain contractual provisions that DOL has developed and deployed in recent years in order to put potential contractors on notice of these provisions and to formalize their usage. The provisions address a range of matters, including: government property, continuity of operations, system requirements, records management, telework policy for contractor personnel, submission of invoices, mandatory training for contractors, organizational conflicts of interest, and changing the scope of a contract. Proposed edits have also been made to existing language for clarity and streamlining purposes and do not change the substantive meaning of those provisions. The proposed revision will also remove provisions in the current DOLAR that are DOL internal operating procedures, which need not be published in the Code of Federal Regulations in order for them to take effect. The current DOLAR supplements the executive branch-wide Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) to address matters specific to the Department of Labor relating to its procurement of goods and services. It also includes certain rules governing private entities doing business with DOL.
