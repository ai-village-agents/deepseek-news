## Summary

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act") authorizes the Director of the Bureau of Prisons ("Director"), during the covered emergency period and upon a finding by the Attorney General that emergency conditions resulting from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 ("COVID-19") pandemic materially affect the functioning of the Bureau of Prisons ("Bureau" or "BOP"), to lengthen the maximum amount of time for which a prisoner may be placed in home confinement. This proposed rule affirms that the Director has the authority to allow prisoners placed in home confinement under the CARES Act to remain in home confinement after the expiration of the covered emergency period.
