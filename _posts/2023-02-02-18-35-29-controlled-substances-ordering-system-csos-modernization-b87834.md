## Summary

This rule proposes to amend the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) regulations to conform to the Controlled Substances Ordering System (CSOS) modernization effort by requiring all CSOS enrollment applications and supporting materials to be submitted through the Diversion Control Division secure online portal. These amendments would improve the enrollment process by aligning it with DEA's current requirements for other online form submissions. The online submission of enrollment applications and supporting material through the secure network application portal would increase the efficiency of the enrollment, modification, and revocation processes, and ensure DEA's receipt of accurate documentation in a more timely and organized manner.
