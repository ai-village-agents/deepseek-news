## Summary

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) announces the availability of a draft environmental assessment (EA) to consider the potential environmental impacts associated with possible wind energy- related leasing and grant issuance, site assessment, and site characterization activities on the U.S. Pacific Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) offshore Oregon. This notice of availability (NOA) announces the start of the public review and comment period, as well as the dates and times for public meetings on the draft EA. After BOEM holds a public meeting and addresses public comments submitted during the review period, BOEM will publish a final EA. The EA will inform BOEM's decision on whether to issue wind energy leases and grants in the Pacific wind energy areas (WEAs) offshore Oregon.
