## Summary

This action amends VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-67, V-190, and V-429; establishes Area Navigation (RNAV) route T-312; and removes VOR Federal airways V-125 and V-335 in the vicinity of Marion, IL. The Air Traffic Service (ATS) route modifications are necessary due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Marion, IL, VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/ DME) navigation aid (NAVAID). With the exception of the RNAV route T- 312, the Marion VOR/DME NAVAID provides navigation guidance for portions of the affected ATS routes. The VOR is being decommissioned as part of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
