## Summary

In 2014, under the Endangered Species Act, we, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), issued an incidental take permit (ITP) authorizing take of two federally endangered fish species incidental to otherwise lawful activities associated with implementation of the PacifiCorp Klamath Hydroelectric Project Interim Operations Habitat Conservation Plan. Subsequently, the Klamath River Renewal Corporation and the States of Oregon and California acquired ownership of lands covered by the ITP. We now announce that the Service has carried out a partial transfer of the ITP to these entities.
