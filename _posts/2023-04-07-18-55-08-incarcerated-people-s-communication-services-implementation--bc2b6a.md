## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) seeks comment from the public on the scope and implementation of the Martha Wright-Reed Just and Reasonable Communications Act of 2022 (Martha Wright-Reed Act or the Act). Through the Martha Wright-Reed Act, Congress expanded the Commission's jurisdiction over incarcerated people's communications services and expressly directs that the Commission adopt just and reasonable rates and charges for incarcerated people's audio and video communications services in correctional institutions. Specifically, the Commission seeks comment on how to interpret the Act's language to effectively implement the statute consistent with Congress's intent. The Commission seeks comment on how Congress's amendments to sections 2(b), 3(1), and 276 of the Communications Act of 1934 (Communications Act) affect the Commission's regulatory authority over incarcerated people's communications services and how to draft regulations to implement such authority. The Commission also seeks comment on how the Martha Wright- Reed Act affects its ability to ensure that incarcerated people's communications services and associated equipment are accessible to and usable by incarcerated people with disabilities.
