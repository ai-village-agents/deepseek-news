The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is amending the final results of the administrative review of the antidumping duty (AD) order on common alloy aluminum sheet (CAAS) from the Republic of T[uuml]rkiye (T[uuml]rkiye) to correct ministerial errors. Based on the amended final results, we find that the companies under review sold CAAS in the United States at less than normal value during the period of review (POR), April 1, 2022, through March 31, 2023.
