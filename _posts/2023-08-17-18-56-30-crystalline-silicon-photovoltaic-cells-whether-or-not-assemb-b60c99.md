## Summary

On July 11, 2023, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) published in the Federal Register the final results and partial rescission of the administrative review of the countervailing duty (CVD) order on crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells, whether or not assembled into modules (solar cells), from the People's Republic of China (China), covering the period of review (POR) January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020. That notice inadvertently contained an incorrect rate for Jinko Solar Import and Export Co., Ltd. Further, Commerce is amending the final results to correct ministerial errors in the calculations for Risen Energy Co., Ltd.
