## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA, the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving two revisions to the Arkansas State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the Governor on May 12, 2022, and November 1, 2022. These SIP revisions were submitted in response to EPA's June 12, 2015, finding of substantial inadequacy and SIP call concerning excess emissions during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) events. EPA is approving these SIP revisions and finds that the revisions correct the inadequacies identified in Arkansas' SIP in the June 12, 2015, SIP call.
