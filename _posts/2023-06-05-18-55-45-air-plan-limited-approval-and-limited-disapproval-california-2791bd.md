## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing a limited approval and limited disapproval of a revision to the Eastern Kern Air Pollution Control District (EKAPCD or "District") portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). This revision concerns emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) from Portland Cement Kilns. Under the authority of the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), this action simultaneously approves a local rule that regulates these emission sources and directs California to correct rule deficiencies. We are finalizing a limited approval of a local rule that regulates these emission sources because the rule would strengthen the current SIP-approved version of EKAPCD's Portland cement kiln rule. We are finalizing a limited disapproval of this revision due to the presence of exemptions for periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (breakdown), which are inconsistent with CAA requirements.
