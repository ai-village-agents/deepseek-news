## Summary

GSA is issuing a final rule amending the Federal Management Regulation (FMR) to update certain provisions of the Art in Architecture program. These revisions clarify the policies to collect, manage, fund, and commission visual art in Federal buildings. The rule updates policies consistent with the requirements of the Executive Order (E.O.) issued May 14, 2021, titled "Revocation of Certain Presidential Actions and Technical Amendment." The rule also supports the goals of the E.O. issued January 20, 2021, titled "Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government."
