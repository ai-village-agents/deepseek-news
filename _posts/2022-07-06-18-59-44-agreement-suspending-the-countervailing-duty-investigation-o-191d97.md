## Summary

The Department of Commerce (Commerce) continues to find that the signatories, the Government of Mexico (GOM), and the respondent companies selected for individual examination, respectively, Impulsora Azucarera Del Tr[oacute]pico, S.A. de C.V. and its affiliate (collectively, Grupo Del Tropico), and Ingenio Huixtla SA de C.V. and its affiliates (collectively, Grupo Porres) (together, we refer to Grupo Del Tropico and Grupo Porres as "Respondents"), were in compliance with the terms of the Agreement Suspending the Countervailing Duty Investigation on Sugar from Mexico, as amended (CVD Agreement), during the period of review (POR) from January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020, except for certain instances of inconsequential non-compliance. Commerce also continues to find that the CVD Agreement met the statutory requirements under sections 704(c) and (d) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act) during the POR. However, we intend to address certain issues identified in this review by opening consultations with the GOM under Section VIII.D.4 of the CVD Agreement.
