## Summary

This action proposes to amend Class D airspace, Class E surface airspace, and Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Middle Georgia Regional Airport, Macon, GA, as a result of the biennial airspace evaluation. This action would extend the Class D airspace and Class E surface airspace for the airport and reduce Class E airspace upward from 700 feet above the surface surrounding Middle Georgia Regional and Macon Downtown Airports. The extension of Class D and Class E surface airspace at Middle Georgia Regional Airport will not impact the Class D or Class E surface airspace boundaries of Robins AFB. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.
