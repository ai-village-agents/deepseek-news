The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Promoting Adolescent Health through School-Based HIV/STD Prevention Reporting Templates. The data collection is designed to obtain detailed, specific, and consistent reporting measures to ensure that the Division of Adolescent and School Health (DASH) can determine the context, process, and effectiveness of program activities.
