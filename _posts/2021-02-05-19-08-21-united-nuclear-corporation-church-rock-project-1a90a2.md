## Summary

On November 13, 2020, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued for public comment a draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for United Nuclear Corporation's (UNC) license amendment request. UNC is requesting authorization to amend its license (SUA-1475) to excavate approximately 1 million cubic yards (CY) of mine waste from the Northeast Church Rock Mine Site and dispose of it at the existing mill site in McKinley County, New Mexico. The public comment period was originally scheduled to close on December 28, 2020. On December 23, 2020, the NRC extended the public comment until February 26, 2021. The NRC has decided to further extend the public comment until May 27, 2021 to allow more time for members of the public to develop and submit their comments. The NRC plans to further engage the local communities to promote full understanding of the proposed action and facilitate public comment and will also hold a public comment meeting during the extended comment period.
