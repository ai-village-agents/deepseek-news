## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) proposes steps to improve the availability and accuracy of caller identification information transmitted to consumers to enable them to better understand who is calling and decide whether to answer calls. Specifically, the Commission proposes to enhance the effectiveness of STIR/SHAKEN by requiring terminating providers to transmit verified caller name or other caller identity information for presentation on a consumer's handset whenever they transmit an indication that a call has received an A-level attestation. It also seeks comment on requiring providers to use Rich Call Data (RCD) to transmit verified caller name on IP networks, whether to permit or require use of other solutions, and an alternative option to require that providers implement RCD in their IP networks for all calls. The Commission further proposes to require voice service providers to implement measures to ensure that consumers know which calls originate from outside of the United States and to prohibit spoofing of United States telephone numbers for calls that originate from outside of the United States. Finally, the Commission seeks comment on whether some of its calling-related rules can be simplified, streamlined, or eliminated, perhaps because they are outdated or have not been enforced for a substantial amount of time.
