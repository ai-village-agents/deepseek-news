## Summary

In accordance with the 2022 National Biodefense Strategy for Countering Biological Threats, Enhancing Pandemic Preparedness, and Achieving Global Health Security (National Biodefense Strategy) and the American Pandemic Preparedness Plan (AP3), the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), in partnership with the National Security Council (NSC), is leading efforts to ensure that coordinated and large-scale clinical trials can be efficiently carried out across a range of institutions and sites to address outbreaks of disease and other emergencies. Efforts in this area could include the establishment of a U.S.-level governance structure and outreach to a wide range of institutions, clinical trial networks, and other potential trial sites that can participate in emergency research, both domestically and internationally. A further goal of this emergency clinical trials initiative is to support the expansion of clinical research into underserved communities, and increase diversity among both trial participants and clinical trial investigators. Building U.S. capacity to carry out emergency clinical trials will enlarge and strengthen the U.S. clinical trials infrastructure overall.
