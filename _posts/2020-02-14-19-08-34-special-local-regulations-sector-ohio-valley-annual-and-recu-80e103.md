## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes amending and updating its special local regulations for recurring marine parades, regattas, and other events that take place in the Coast Guard Sector Ohio Valley area of responsibility (AOR). Through this notice the current list of recurring special local regulations is updated with revisions, additions, and removals of events that no longer take place in the Sector Ohio Valley AOR. When these special local regulations are enforced, certain restrictions are placed on marine traffic in specified areas. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
