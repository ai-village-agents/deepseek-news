## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), issues this final rule to provide clarity and safeguards that address the public health risk of dog-maintained rabies virus variant (DMRVV) associated with the importation of dogs into the United States. This final rule addresses the importation of cats as part of overall changes to the regulations affecting both dogs and cats, but the final rule does not require that imported cats be accompanied by proof of rabies vaccination and does not substantively change how cats are imported into the United States.
