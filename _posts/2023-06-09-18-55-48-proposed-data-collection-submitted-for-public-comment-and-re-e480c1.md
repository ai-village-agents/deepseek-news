## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of Government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Enterprise Laboratory Information Management System (ELIMS). This data collection is used by CDC to record specimen metadata and patient data related to test order requests submitted by external partners (SPHLs, International organizations, Federal institutions, hospitals, doctor's offices, etc.) to the CDC Infectious Diseases testing laboratories.
