## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Stemme AG TSA-M Model S6 and S6-RT gliders. This AD was prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) issued by the aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI describes the unsafe condition as a new version of the propeller gearbox tooth belt with a reduced life limit. This AD requires establishing a life limit of 5 years for certain propeller gearbox tooth belts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
