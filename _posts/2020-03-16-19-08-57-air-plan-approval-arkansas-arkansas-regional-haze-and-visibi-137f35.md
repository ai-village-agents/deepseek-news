## Summary

Pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the Arkansas State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Arkansas through the Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) on August 13, 2019. The SIP submittal addresses requirements of the Act and the Regional Haze Rule for visibility protection in mandatory Class I Federal areas (Class I areas) for the first implementation period. The EPA is proposing to approve an alternative measure to best available retrofit technology (BART) for sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>), particulate matter (PM), and nitrogen oxide (NO<INF>X</INF>) at the Domtar Ashdown Mill and elements of the SIP submittal that relate to these BART requirements at this facility. In addition, we are proposing to approve the withdrawal from the SIP the previously approved PM<INF>10</INF> BART limit and the federal implementation plan (FIP) provisions for the Domtar Ashdown Mill. The EPA is also concurrently proposing to approve Arkansas' interstate visibility transport provisions from the August 10, 2018, regional haze SIP submittal as supplemented by the visibility transport provisions in the October 4, 2019, interstate transport SIP submittal, which covers the following national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS): The 2006 24-hour fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) NAAQS; the 2012 annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS; the 2008 and 2015 eight-hour ozone (O<INF>3</INF>) NAAQS; the 2010 one-hour nitrogen dioxide (NO<INF>2</INF>) NAAQS; and the 2010 one-hour SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS.
