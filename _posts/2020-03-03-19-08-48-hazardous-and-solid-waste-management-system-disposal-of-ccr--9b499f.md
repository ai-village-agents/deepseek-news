## Summary

On April 17, 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) promulgated national minimum criteria for existing and new coal combustion residuals (CCR) landfills and existing and new CCR surface impoundments pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended. In this action, EPA is proposing procedures to allow facilities to request approval to operate with an alternate liner for existing CCR surface impoundments, two co-proposed options to allow the use of CCR during unit closure, an additional closure option for CCR units being closed by removal of CCR, and requirements for annual closure progress reports. Regarding the options to allow the use of CCR during unit closure, this action serves as a supplemental proposal to a proposed rule issued on March 15, 2018. In that March 2018 proposal, the Agency proposed to allow the continued placement of CCR in units triggered for closure to construct final cover systems provided certain conditions were met.
