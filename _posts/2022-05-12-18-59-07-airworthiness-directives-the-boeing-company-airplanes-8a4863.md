## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-14- 13, which applied to certain The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, - 700C, -800, -900, and -900ER series airplanes. AD 2017-14-13 required a torque check of the screws in the cover assembly of the heel rest for both the captain's and the first officer's rudder pedals, and corrective action if necessary. This AD was prompted by a report of an aborted takeoff because the rudder pedals were not operating correctly, and subsequent reports of loose rudder pedal cover fasteners on airplanes on which the actions required by AD 2017-14-13 were done and on additional airplanes that were not included in the applicability of AD 2017-14-13. This AD requires modifying the rudder pedal cover and shroud assemblies, and applies to all The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER series airplanes and Model 737-8 and 737-9 airplanes. This AD also limits the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
