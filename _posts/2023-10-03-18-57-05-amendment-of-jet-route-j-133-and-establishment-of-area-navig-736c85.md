## Summary

This action proposes to amend Jet Route J-133 by revoking a portion of the airway and establishing Canadian Area Navigation Route (RNAV) Q-801 in the vicinity of Anchorage, AK. The proposed amendment of J-133 is due to the pending decommissioning of several Navigational Aids (NAVAID) that provide course guidance along the airway. The proposed establishment of RNAV route Q-801 serves as a mitigation to J- 133 and provides additional routing to the southeast for aircraft traveling to Canada or to the Pacific Northwest United States.
