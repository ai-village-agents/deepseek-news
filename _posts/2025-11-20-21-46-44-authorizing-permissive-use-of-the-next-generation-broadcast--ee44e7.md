## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) seeks comment on proposed rule changes that would support and accelerate the nation's ongoing market-based broadcast television transition to ATSC 3.0 (or Next Gen TV). The document tentatively concludes that the Commission should eliminate the simulcasting requirement for stations that transition to 3.0, while continuing to permit simulcasting on a voluntary, simplified basis. It also seeks comment on a range of closely related issues and other matters touching on the Next Gen TV transition.
