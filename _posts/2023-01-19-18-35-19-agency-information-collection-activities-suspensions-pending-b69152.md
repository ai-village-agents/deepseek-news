## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 ("PRA"), the Office of Natural Resources Revenue ("ONRR") is proposing to revise a currently approved information collection to expand its scope to include the mineral estate underlying Osage County, Oklahoma ("Osage Mineral Estate"). Through this revision, ONRR seeks authority to collect information related to the paperwork requirements under the Bureau of Indian Affairs' ("BIA") proposed regulations to post a surety or bond, or demonstrate financial solvency. ONRR uses forms ONRR-4435, ONRR-4436, and ONRR-4437 as part of these information collection requirements.
