## Summary

The Coast Guard is changing the operating schedule that governs the California Department of Transportation (Route 4) highway bridge, across Old River, mile 14.8, between Victoria Island and Byron Tract, California. This action is due to the infrequent amount of vessels requiring drawbridge openings on the waterway. It will reduce unnecessary staffing of the drawbridge during periods of navigational inactivity while continuing to meet the reasonable needs of navigation. The schedule change would require vessels to provide a four-hour advance notification for drawspan opening.
