## Summary

This rule is promulgated for two reasons: To revise the definition of "equivalent of a diplomatic passport" to include non- national passports issued by a competent authority other than a foreign government and as designated by the Secretary of State; and to clarify the categories of nonimmigrants who may be eligible for a "diplomatic type" or "official type" visa, irrespective of the nonimmigrant visa classification. These technical revisions provide greater clarity and consistency with existing U.S. law and practices regarding the entities that the United States considers eligible to issue travel documents and the individuals who may qualify for "diplomatic type" or "official type" visas, irrespective of the nonimmigrant visa classification.
