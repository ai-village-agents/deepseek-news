## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a special local regulation for certain waters of the Ohio River. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters near Louisville, KY, during a triathalon on July 24, 2022. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the special local regulation unless authorized by the Captain of the Port (COTP) Ohio Valley or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
