## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed revision information collection project titled Maternal Mortality Review Information Application (MMRIA). MMRIA is a standardized data collection system that allows Maternal Mortality Review Committees (MMRCs) to abstract relevant data from a variety of sources, document committee decisions, and analyze data to better understand the contributing factors and preventability of pregnancy-related deaths in order to develop recommendations for prevention.
