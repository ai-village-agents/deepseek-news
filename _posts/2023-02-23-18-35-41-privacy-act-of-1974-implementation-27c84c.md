## Summary

The Department of Defense (DoD or Department) is giving concurrent notice of a new Department-wide system of records titled "Privacy and Civil Liberties Complaints and Correspondence Records," DoD-0017, and this rulemaking, which is exempting portions of this system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, because of national security requirements. This rule is being published as a direct final rule as the Department does not expect to receive any significant adverse comments. If such comments are received, this direct final rule will be cancelled and a proposed rule for comments will be published.
