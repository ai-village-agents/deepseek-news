## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving changes to the Kentucky State Implementation Plan (SIP) concerning the Cross- State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) submitted by Kentucky on September 14, 2018, as later clarified on December 18, 2018. Under CSAPR, large electricity generating units (EGUs) in Kentucky are subject to Federal Implementation Plans (FIPs) requiring the units to participate in CSAPR's federal trading program for annual emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>), one of CSAPR's two federal trading programs for ozone season emissions of NO<INF>X</INF>, and one of CSAPR's two federal trading programs for annual emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>). This action approves into the SIP the Commonwealth's regulations requiring large Kentucky EGUs to participate in CSAPR state trading programs for annual NO<INF>X</INF> emissions and annual SO<INF>2</INF> emissions integrated with the CSAPR federal trading programs, replacing the corresponding FIP requirements. EPA is approving the portions of the SIP revision concerning these CSAPR state trading programs because the SIP revision meets the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) and EPA's regulations for approval of a CSAPR full SIP revision replacing the requirements of a CSAPR FIP. Under the CSAPR regulations, approval of these portions of the SIP revision automatically eliminates Kentucky units' obligations to participate in CSAPR's federal trading programs for annual NO<INF>X</INF> emissions and annual SO<INF>2</INF> emissions under the corresponding CSAPR FIPs addressing interstate transport requirements for the 1997 annual fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) and the 2006 24-hour PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS. Approval of these portions of the SIP revision would also satisfy Kentucky's good neighbor obligation under the CAA to prohibit emissions which will significantly contribute to nonattainment or interfere with maintenance of the 1997 annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS and 2006 24-hour PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS.
