## Summary

On August 21, 2025, the United States and the European Union announced agreement on a Framework on an Agreement on Reciprocal, Fair, and Balanced Trade (Framework Agreement). On September 5, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14346, Modifying the Scope of Reciprocal Tariffs and Establishing Procedures for Implementing Trade and Security Agreements, finding that it is necessary and appropriate to implement the tariff modifications described in that Framework Agreement. Executive Order 14346 also directed and authorized the Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative to take the necessary and appropriate steps to implement any current or forthcoming trade and security framework agreements between a foreign trading partner and the United States. This notice amends the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to implement the elements of the Framework Agreement that adjust tariffs on certain articles that are products of the European Union, including automobiles and automobile parts subject to tariffs under Proclamation 10908, Adjusting Imports of Automobiles and Automobile Parts Into the United States, as amended, and unavailable natural resources (including cork), all aircraft and aircraft parts, and generic pharmaceuticals and their ingredients and chemical precursors.
