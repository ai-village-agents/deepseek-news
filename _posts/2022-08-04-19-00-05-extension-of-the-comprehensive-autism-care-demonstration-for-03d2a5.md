## Summary

This notice provides a five-year extension to the Military Health System's (MHS) demonstration project entitled Comprehensive ACD (the "Demonstration"), which is authorized to render clinically necessary and appropriate ABA services for the core symptoms of ASD. The purpose of the Demonstration is to analyze and evaluate the appropriateness of the ABA services tiered delivery model under TRICARE (the medical benefit) in light of current and anticipated practice guidelines. In addition to a pending independent research study and a Congressionally-required independent National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine analysis, based on the agency's experience in administering ABA services under the Demonstration (including engagements with beneficiaries, providers, advocates, associations, and other payers), more data collection and analysis is required to determine the appropriate structure of implementing ABA services as either a medical treatment or other modality, under the TRICARE program coverage requirements.
