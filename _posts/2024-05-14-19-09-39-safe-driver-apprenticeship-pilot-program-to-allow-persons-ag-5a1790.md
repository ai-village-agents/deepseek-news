## Summary

The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), which was signed into law on November 15, 2021, required FMCSA to establish a pilot program that would allow employers to establish an apprenticeship program for certain 18-, 19-, and 20-year-old drivers to operate commercial vehicles in interstate commerce. FMCSA announced the establishment of the Safe Driver Apprenticeship Pilot (SDAP) Program in the Federal Register on January 14, 2022, including the requirements for motor carriers wishing to participate. This notice revises those requirements, as directed by Congress in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024.
