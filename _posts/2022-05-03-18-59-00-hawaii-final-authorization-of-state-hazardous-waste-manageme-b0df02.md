## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking direct final action on the authorization of Hawaii's changes to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). These changes correspond to certain Federal rules promulgated between July 1, 2016, and June 30, 2020, (also known as RCRA Clusters XXV to XXVIII) and for authorization of state-initiated changes that are equivalent to or more stringent than the Federal program. We have determined that these changes satisfy all requirements needed for final authorization.
