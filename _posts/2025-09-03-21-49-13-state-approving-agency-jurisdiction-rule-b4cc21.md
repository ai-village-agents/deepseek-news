# State Approving Agency Jurisdiction Rule

**Published:** February 04, 2026 21:49 UTC

## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) publishes a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) to amend its definitions of the terms "independent study," "distance learning," and "resident learning," and to establish a new term, "standard curriculum." These proposed amendments, which distinguish distance learning from resident learning and independent study from standard curriculum, address concerns from VA stakeholders who view independent study and distance learning as having distinct and separate meanings and clarify State Approving Agency (SAA) jurisdiction over courses taken solely by distance learning.
