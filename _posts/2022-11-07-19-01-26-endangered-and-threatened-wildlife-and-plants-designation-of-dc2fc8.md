## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce revisions to the critical habitat we proposed on October 19, 2021, for the federally endangered Southern Sierra Nevada distinct population segment (DPS) of fisher (Pekania pennanti) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). As a result of the critical habitat revisions, we now propose to designate a total of approximately 595,495 acres (240,988 hectares) as critical habitat for the Southern Sierra Nevada DPS of fisher across six units (one unit of which is further subdivided into two subunits) in California. This amounts to an overall increase of 41,041 acres (16,609 hectares) in our proposed critical habitat designation for the DPS, which includes revisions to all six units. We invite interested parties to comment on the revisions described in this document. Comments previously submitted on the October 19, 2021, proposed rule need not be resubmitted, as they will be fully considered in preparation of the final rule.
