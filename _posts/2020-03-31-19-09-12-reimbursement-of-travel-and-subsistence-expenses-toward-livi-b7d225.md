## Summary

HRSA published the final eligibility guidelines for the Reimbursement of Travel and Subsistence Expenses toward Living Organ Donation Program (herein referred to as Program) in the Federal Register on October 5, 2007. HRSA is requesting public comment concerning proposed changes to the guidelines to: increase the household income eligibility threshold to 350% (currently, the threshold is 300%) for living organ donors and organ recipients, clarify the use of the existing preference categories in relation to the proposed household income eligibility threshold, and clarify that travel and subsistence expenses incurred by non-directed living organ donors qualify as reimbursable expenses under the Program. HRSA is also proposing to revise the Program eligibility guideline's background section to ensure that the information aligns with the Program's legislative authority. These proposed guidelines would apply to the Program regardless of the awardee of the cooperative agreement that administers the Program.
