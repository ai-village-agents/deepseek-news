## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-18- 14, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A330-200 series, A330-200 Freighter series, A330-300 series, A330-800 series, and A330-900 series airplanes. AD 2022-18-14 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. This AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2022-18- 14, and also requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable to incorporate additional new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations; as specified in two European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) ADs, which are incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
