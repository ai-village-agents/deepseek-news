## Summary

This document announces and provides the reasoning for the U.S. Department of Energy's ("DOE's") denial of a petition from the Soft Lights Foundation ("Soft Lights") requesting the repeal of two final rules published by DOE on May 9, 2022: the final rule codifying the 45 lumens per watt backstop requirement for general service lamps that Congress prescribed in the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended ("EPCA") and the final rule adopting amended definitions of general service lamps ("GSLs") and general service incandescent lamps ("GSILs") and associated supplemental definitions.
