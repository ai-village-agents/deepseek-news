## Summary

The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) adopts as final, without changes, a proposed rule concerning the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP)'s mutual fund window--which we will make available to TSP participants beginning in June 2022. This final rule establishes a fee designed to guarantee that the availability of the mutual fund window will not indirectly increase the share of TSP administrative expenses borne by participants who choose not to use the mutual fund window. We are also adopting policies to govern fund transfers to and from the mutual fund window, including a restriction on the amount that a participant may invest through the mutual fund window.
