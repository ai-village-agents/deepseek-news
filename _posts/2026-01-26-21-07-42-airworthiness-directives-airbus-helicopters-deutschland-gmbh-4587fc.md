## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (AHD) Model MBB-BK 117 C-2 and MBB-BK 117 D-2 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that a certain part-numbered standard MS18027 type hook may be subject to localized yielding in the mating threads when assembled to higher assembly torques. This proposed AD would require modifying and re-identifying the affected part or replacing the affected part with a serviceable part. This proposed AD would also prohibit installing an affected part on any helicopter unless certain requirements are met. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
