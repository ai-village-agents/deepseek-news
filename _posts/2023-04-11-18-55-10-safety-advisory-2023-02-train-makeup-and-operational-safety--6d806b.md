## Summary

FRA is issuing Safety Advisory 2023-02 to emphasize significant concerns related to train makeup and to ensure that all railroads exercise due diligence and recognize the importance of taking proactive measures to address potential safety risks related to operating train builds with varying configurations, load and empty placement, distributed power arrangements, and other factors. FRA has noticed a rising trend in recent incidents where train build and makeup have been identified as a potential cause or contributing factor. In response, FRA incorporates train simulations into its investigative process when it is suspected that high in-train forces may have contributed to train accidents. To address these concerns, FRA is providing recommendations for freight railroads to improve the safety of their train build processes and practices.
