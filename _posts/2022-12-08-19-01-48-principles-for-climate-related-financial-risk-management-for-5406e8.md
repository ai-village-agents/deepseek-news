## Summary

The Board is requesting comment on draft principles that would provide a high-level framework for the safe and sound management of exposures to climate-related financial risks for Board-supervised financial institutions with over $100 billion in assets. Although all financial institutions, regardless of size, may have material exposures to climate-related financial risks, these principles are intended for the largest financial institutions, i.e., those with over $100 billion in total consolidated assets. The draft principles are intended to support efforts by large financial institutions to focus on key aspects of climate-related financial risk management.
