## Summary

Through this notice, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announces that the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) is terminating the designation of Honduras for Temporary Protected Status (TPS). The designation of Honduras is set to expire on July 5, 2025. After reviewing country conditions and consulting with appropriate U.S. Government agencies, the Secretary has determined that conditions in Honduras no longer support its designation for TPS. The Secretary, therefore, is terminating the TPS designation of Honduras as required by statute. This termination is effective September 8, 2025. After September 8, 2025, nationals of Honduras (and aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in Honduras) who have been granted TPS under Honduras' designation will no longer have TPS.
