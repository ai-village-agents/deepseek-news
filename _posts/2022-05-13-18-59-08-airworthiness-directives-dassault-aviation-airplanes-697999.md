## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Dassault Aviation Model FALCON 2000 and FALCON 2000EX airplanes. This AD was prompted by brake system failures during landing due to a brake servo-valve failure resulting from application of an inappropriate oil type during production and maintenance. This AD requires relocating affected servo-valves and revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to provide temporary information necessary to operate airplanes fitted with at least one affected brake servo-valve, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also limits or prohibits the installation of affected brake servo-valves. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
