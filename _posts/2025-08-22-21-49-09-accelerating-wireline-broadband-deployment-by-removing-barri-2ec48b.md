## Summary

In this document, the Commission adopted a Fourth Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (FNPRM or Further Notice) addressing deployment of broadband facilities on utility poles. It seeks comment on requiring attachers to deploy equipment on poles within 120 days of completion of make-ready work. It also seeks comment on whether the Commission should require attachers to make payment on an estimate to a utility within a specific period of time after acceptance. It additionally seeks comment on limiting the amount that final make-ready costs can exceed the utility's estimate without receiving prior approval from the attacher. It further seeks comment on whether to expand the availability of the one-touch, make-ready (OTMR) process to include complex survey and make-ready work. Moreover, it seeks comment establishing a deadline to on-board approved contractors. It also seeks comment on whether the Commission should define the term "pole" for purposes of Section 224 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and whether the term should be construed to include light poles. Further, it seeks comment on legal authority to adopt each of the proposals as well as any other germane policy points or facts, and on how the costs, benefits, or burdens of any rules the Commission adopts might impact businesses of various sizes.
