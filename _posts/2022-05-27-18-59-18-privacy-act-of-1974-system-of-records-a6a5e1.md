## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the DoD is modifying and reissuing a current system of records titled, "Defense Manpower Data Base," DMDC 01. This system of records was originally established by the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) to collect and maintain records for the purpose of providing a single central facility within the DoD to assess manpower trends, support personnel and readiness functions, to perform longitudinal statistical analyses, identify current and former DoD civilian and Armed Forces personnel for purposes of detecting fraud and abuse of pay and benefit programs, to register current and former DoD civilian and Armed Forces personnel and their authorized dependents for purposes of obtaining medical examination, treatment or other benefits to which they are qualified. It is also used to collect debts owed to the United States Government and state and local governments. The DMDC manages a series of files within this system of records for the purposes of serving as the central DoD repository for various personnel and manpower assessments. This system of records notice (SORN) is being updated to make various changes, including expanding the individuals covered, updating a routine use relating to computer matching programs, and adding DoD's standard routine uses.
