## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is notifying the public that documents regarding draft and final Regulatory Guides that historically have been published in the "Notices" section of the Federal Register will now be published in the "Proposed Rules" and "Rules and Regulations" sections of the Federal Register. The Office of the Federal Register recently informed the NRC that under their guidelines, these documents fall into the "Proposed Rules" and "Rules and Regulations" categories and requested that the NRC reclassify these notices.
