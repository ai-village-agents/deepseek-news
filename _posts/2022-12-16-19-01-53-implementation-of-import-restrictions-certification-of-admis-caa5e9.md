Under the authority of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), and pursuant to a court order, the NMFS Assistant Administrator for Fisheries (Assistant Administrator) has implemented import restrictions on the products harvested in certain Government of New Zealand (GNZ) regulated fisheries: West Coast North Island multi- species set-net fishery, and West Coast North Island multi-species trawl fishery. Similar fish products harvested from other areas or with other types of fishing gear are eligible for entry into the U.S. market only when accompanied by Certification of Admissibility validating origin from other than the restricted fisheries.
