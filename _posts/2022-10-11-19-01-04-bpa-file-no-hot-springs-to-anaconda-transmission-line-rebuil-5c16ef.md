## Summary

This notice advises the public that BPA is terminating the preparation of the Hot Springs to Anaconda Transmission Line Rebuild Project EIS (DOE/EIS-0502) that was announced in the Notice of Intent in the Federal Register on July 11, 2014. This EIS was considering BPA's decision whether to rebuild the Hot Springs to Rattlesnake, Rattlesnake to Garrison, and Garrison to Anaconda (collectively Hot Springs to Anaconda) 230-kilovolt (kV) transmission lines. BPA sold the Garrison to Anaconda line and the rebuild design of the remaining two lines has changed since the 2014 Notice of Intent (NOI). In the future, BPA will consider rebuild of the remaining two transmission lines upon redesign.
