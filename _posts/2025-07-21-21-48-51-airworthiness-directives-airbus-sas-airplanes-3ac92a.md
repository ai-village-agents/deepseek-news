## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-27- 01, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. AD 2022-27-01 required replacing affected fasteners and applying additional head nut cap protection at the front and rear spars in the center wing box (CWB). Since the FAA issued AD 2022-27-01, the FAA determined that additional Airbus SAS Model A350 manufacturer serial numbers (MSNs) are affected by the same potential unsafe condition. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2022-27-01 and expands the applicability to include the additional Airbus SAS Model A350 MSNs. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
