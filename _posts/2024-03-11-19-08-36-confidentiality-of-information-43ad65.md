## Summary

The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) proposes revisions to existing regulations governing the confidentiality of information submitted in compliance with any requirement or regulation under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act; MSA). The purposes of these revisions are to make both substantive and non-substantive changes in light of amendments to the MSA under the 1996 Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA) and the 2006 Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act (MSRA) and amendments to the High Seas Driftnet Fishing Moratorium Protection Act (FMPA) under the 2015 Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing Enforcement Act (IUU Fishing Act). NMFS proposes additional revisions necessary to address some issues that concern its application of the MSA confidentiality of information requirements to information requests.
