## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 767 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of inoperative manual and alternate horizontal stabilizer trim switches. This proposed AD would require repetitive inspections for immersion of each limit switch and position transmitter module (LSPTM) and of the LSPTM electrical wiring, repetitive inspections for blockage of the drain holes and cleaning of each drain hole, repetitive inspections for loose or cracked leveling compound, and applicable on-condition actions. For certain airplanes, this proposed AD would also require installing two new drain holes, performing repetitive inspections for blockage of the drain holes and cleaning each drain hole, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
