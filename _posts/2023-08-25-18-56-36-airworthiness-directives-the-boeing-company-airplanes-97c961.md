# Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 747-8 and 747-8F series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that all six Integrated Display Units (IDUs) became blank when new flight plan data was entered in the Flight Management System (FMS), and by a determination that indication of decaying airspeed in certain scenarios is required. This proposed AD would require installing updated software. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
