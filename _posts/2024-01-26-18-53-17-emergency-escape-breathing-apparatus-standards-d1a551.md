## Summary

FRA is amending its regulations related to occupational noise exposure in three ways. First, in response to a congressional mandate, FRA is expanding those regulations to require that railroads provide an appropriate atmosphere-supplying emergency escape breathing apparatus to every train crew member and certain other employees while they are occupying a locomotive cab of a freight train transporting a hazardous material that would pose an inhalation hazard in the event of release during an accident. Second, FRA is changing the name of this part of its regulations from "Occupational Noise Exposure" to "Occupational Safety and Health in the Locomotive Cab" to reflect the additional subject matter of this final rule and to make other conforming amendments. Third, FRA is removing the provision stating the preemptive effect of this part of FRA's regulations because it is unnecessary.
