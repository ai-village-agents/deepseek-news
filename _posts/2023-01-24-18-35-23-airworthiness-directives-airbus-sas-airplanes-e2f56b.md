## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-08-08, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. AD 2021-08-08 requires replacing affected bleed duct assemblies and bleed gimbals at the wing-to-pylon interface, and prohibits the installation of affected parts. This AD was prompted by a report of a welding quality issue in the gimbal joint of the air bleed duct at each wing-to-pylon interface and the consequent deformation of the gimbal inner ring, and by new findings that affected bleed gimbals were found on certain airplanes that did not have any maintenance record of affected part replacement. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2021-08-08 and, for certain airplanes, would require inspection of the bleed gimbals to determine the part number and replacement if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
