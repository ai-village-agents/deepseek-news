## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of the SpCas9 protein in or on the food and feed commodities of citrus when used as a plant-incorporated protectant (PIP) in citrus. Soil Culture Solutions LLC (d/b/a Soilcea) submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of SpCas9 protein.
