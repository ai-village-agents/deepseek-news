# Guidance on Response Programs for Unauthorized Access to Member Information and Member Notice

## Summary

The NCUA Board (Board) is proposing to remove Appendix B to part 748, Guidance on Response Programs for Unauthorized Access to Member Information and Member Notice. Appendix B was issued in June 2005. Its purpose was to provide federally insured credit unions (FICUs) with guidance for creating programs to address and respond to instances of unauthorized access to member information. The Board now believes that the placement of Appendix B in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) may be confusing because Appendix B itself is guidance to assist FICUs in developing the response programs required pursuant to regulation. The Board instead would publish the content of Appendix B as guidance. This will be a better vehicle for conveying and updating this information and will help to streamline NCUA's regulations.
