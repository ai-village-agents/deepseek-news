## Summary

The Coast Guard announces its intent to enter into a cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) to evaluate track classification and discrimination technology and address its ability to perform for specific USCG needs supporting operations. The Coast Guard is currently considering partnering with RADA Technologies LLC and solicits public comment on the possible participation of other parties in the proposed CRADA, and the nature of that participation. The Coast Guard also invites other potential non-Federal participants, who have the interest and capability to bring similar contributions to this type of research, to consider submitting proposals for consideration in similar CRADAs.
