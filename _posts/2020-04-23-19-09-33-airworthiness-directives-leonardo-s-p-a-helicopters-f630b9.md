## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Leonardo S.p.a. (Leonardo) Model A109E, A109S, and AW109SP helicopters. This proposed AD would require inspecting each fire extinguisher bottle for a crack. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a cracked fire extinguisher bottle. The actions of this proposed AD are intended to address an unsafe condition on these helicopters.
