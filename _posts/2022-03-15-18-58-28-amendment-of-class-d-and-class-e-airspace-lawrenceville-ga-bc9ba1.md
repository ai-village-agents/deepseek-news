## Summary

This action amends Class D airspace and Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface for Lawrenceville, GA. This action updates the airport's name in both the Class D and E airspace to Gwinnett County/Briscoe Field. In addition, this action amends the Class D airspace by creating an extension to the southwest. The Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface is amended by increasing the radius and eliminating the extension to the east. Also, this action eliminates the Gwinnett Non-directional Beacon (NDB) from the legal description. This action also makes an editorial change replacing the term Airport/Facility Directory with the term Chart Supplement in the legal descriptions of the Class D airspace. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.
