## Summary

The FHWA, on behalf of the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), is issuing this notice to announce actions taken by Caltrans and the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management that are final agency actions. These actions relate to the proposed Scenic Route 68 Corridor Improvement project. The project plans intersection operational improvements at nine intersections and wildlife connectivity improvements at five locations within a nine-mile section of State Route 68 between Josselyn Canyon Road and San Benancio Road. The purpose of the project is to reduce travel delays and to reduce vehicle collisions and collisions between vehicles and wildlife, as well as improve access for bicyclists and pedestrians at the intersections. The selected preferred alternative will convert the nine existing signalized intersections to roundabouts.
