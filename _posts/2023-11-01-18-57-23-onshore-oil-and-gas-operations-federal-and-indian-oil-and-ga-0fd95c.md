## Summary

On June 16, 2023, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) published a final rule that codified Onshore Order 1--Approval of Operations; Onshore Order 2--Drilling Operations on Federal and Indian Oil and Gas Leases; Onshore Order 6--Hydrogen Sulfide Operations; and Onshore Order 7--Disposal of Produced Water into the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). This action corrects two cross references in that regulation.
