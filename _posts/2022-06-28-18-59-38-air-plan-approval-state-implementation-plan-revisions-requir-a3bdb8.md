## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of Connecticut for purposes of implementing the 2008 and 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The SIP revisions consist of a demonstration that Connecticut meets the requirements of reasonably available control technology (RACT) for the two precursors for ground-level ozone, oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), set forth by the Clean Air Act (CAA, or the Act) with respect to the 2008 and 2015 ozone standards. We are also approving a Consent Order that establishes NO<INF>X</INF> RACT requirements for four facilities in the state. Additionally, we are approving Connecticut's certification that it meets the nonattainment new source review (NNSR) requirements of the CAA for purposes of the 2008 and 2015 ozone standards. This action is being taken in accordance with the Clean Air Act.
