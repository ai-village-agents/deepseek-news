## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing an exemption in response to a December 02, 2019, letter from Duke Energy Progress, Inc. (DEP), which requested an exemption from certain regulatory requirements for DEP to submit an update to the final safety analysis report (FSAR) included in its application for combined licenses (COLs) for Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant (Harris) Units 2 and 3 by December 31, 2019. The NRC staff reviewed this request and determined that it is appropriate to grant the exemption, but stipulated that the next update to the FSAR must be submitted prior to, or coincident with, the resumption of the COL application review or by December 31, 2024, whichever comes first.
