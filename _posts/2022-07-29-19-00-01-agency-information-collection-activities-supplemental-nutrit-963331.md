## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice invites the general public and other public agencies to comment on this planned information collection. This is a revision of a currently approved collection. Section 6(o) of the Food and Nutrition Act establishes a time limit of the receipt of benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for certain able- bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs) who are not working. The provision authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture, upon a State agency's request, to waive the time limit for any group of individuals if the Secretary determines "that the area in which the individuals reside has an unemployment rate of over 10 percent, or does not have a sufficient number of jobs to provide employment for the individuals." As required by the statute, to receive a waiver, the State agency must submit sufficient supporting information so that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) can make the required determination as to the area's unemployment rate or insufficiency of available jobs. This collection of information is, therefore, necessary to obtain waivers of the SNAP time limit. In October 2020, the U.S. District Court in District of Columbia vacated the final rule titled, "Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: Requirements for Able- Bodied Adults Without Dependents". USDA is revising the hours associated with this collection to reflect the return to regulations prior to the final rule.
