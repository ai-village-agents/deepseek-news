## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to determine that the Hayden lead (Pb) nonattainment area (NAA) failed to attain the 2008 Pb primary and secondary national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or "standards") by the applicable attainment date of October 3, 2019. This proposed determination is based upon monitored air quality data from November 2015-December 2018 for the 2008 Pb NAAQS. The EPA is also proposing to determine that the Hayden and Miami sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) NAAs failed to attain the 2010 1-hour SO<INF>2</INF> primary NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of October 4, 2018, based upon monitored air quality data from January 2015-December 2017. If the EPA finalizes these determinations as proposed, the State of Arizona will be required to submit revisions to the Arizona State Implementation Plan (SIP) that, among other elements, provide for expeditious attainment of the 2008 Pb and 2010 SO<INF>2</INF> standards.
