## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing particulate matter (PM) emission standards and test procedures applicable to certain classes of engines used by civil subsonic jet airplanes (those engines with rated output of greater than 26.7 kilonewtons (kN)) to replace the existing smoke standard for aircraft. These proposed standards and test procedures are equivalent to the engine standards adopted by the United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 2017 and 2020 and would apply to both new type design aircraft engines and in-production aircraft engines. The EPA, as well as the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), actively participated in the ICAO proceedings in which these requirements were developed. These proposed standards would reflect the importance of the control of PM emissions and U.S. efforts to secure the highest practicable degree of uniformity in aviation regulations and standards. Additionally, the EPA is proposing to migrate, modernize, and streamline the existing regulations into a new part. As part of this update, the EPA is also proposing to align with ICAO by applying the smoke number standards to engines less than or equal to 26.7 kilonewtons rated output used in supersonic airplanes.
