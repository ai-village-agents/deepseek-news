## Summary

The Commission is proposing revisions to its rules concerning rate incentives for market dominant products to clarify the definition of "rate of general applicability" within the context of a market dominant price adjustment proceeding; to add an additional criterion for a rate incentive to be included in a percentage change in rates calculation at discounted prices; and to state clearly what information the Postal Service must file to support a claim that a rate incentive meets the necessary criteria to be included in a percentage change in rates calculation at discounted prices. The Commission invites public comment on the propose rules.
