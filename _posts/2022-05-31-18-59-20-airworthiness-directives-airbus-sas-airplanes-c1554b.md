## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-19-13, AD 2018-24-04, and AD 2019-23-02, which apply to certain Airbus SAS Model A330-200 series, A330-200 Freighter series, and A330- 300 series airplanes. ADs 2017-19-13, 2018-24-04, and 2019-23-02 require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2019-23-02, which terminates ADs 2017-19-13 and 2018-24-04 upon its accomplishment, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2019-23-02, add airplanes to the applicability, and require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate additional new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
