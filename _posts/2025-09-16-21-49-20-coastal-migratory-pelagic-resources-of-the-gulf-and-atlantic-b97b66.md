## Summary

NMFS implements an accountability measure (AM) for the commercial harvest of Spanish mackerel in the northern zone of the Atlantic exclusive economic zone (EEZ). NMFS projects that landings will soon reach the revised commercial quota for Spanish mackerel in the northern zone of the Atlantic EEZ for the 2025-2026 fishing year. According to regulations for Spanish mackerel in the Atlantic, NMFS closes the northern zone for commercial harvest to protect this fishery resource.
