## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2013-26-10, which applies to certain Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Model RB211-524G2-19, RB211-524G3-19, RB211-524H-36, and RB211-524H2-19 engines. AD 2013-26-10 requires a one-time reduction in the cyclic life of certain high-pressure compressor (HPC) rotor stage 1 and stage 2 disks, and removal of disks that exceed the reduced cycle life. Since the FAA issued AD 2013-26-10, the manufacturer has revised the engine time limits manual (TLM), introducing new and more restrictive instructions. This proposed AD would require revisions to the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the operator's existing approved engine maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
