## Summary

DOE invites public comment on the proposed three-year extension, without change, to the Form FE-746R, "Natural Gas Imports and Exports," as required under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This information collection request supports DOE's Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM) in gathering critical information on the U.S. trade in natural gas, including liquefied natural gas (LNG). The data are used to monitor natural gas trade, assess the adequacy of U.S. energy resources to meet near and longer term domestic demands, and support various market and regulatory analyses done by FECM.
