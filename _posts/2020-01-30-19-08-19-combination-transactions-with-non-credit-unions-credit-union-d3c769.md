## Summary

The NCUA Board (Board) proposes to add subpart D to part 708a of its regulations. This will clarify and make transparent the procedures and requirements currently in place related to combination transactions. Combination transactions include those where a federally insured credit union (FICU) proposes to assume liabilities from a non- credit union, including a bank. They also include a FICU's merger or consolidation with a non-credit union entity. Further, the proposed rule clarifies the scope of section 741.8 of the NCUA's regulations, which currently requires the NCUA to grant approval before a FICU may purchase loans or assume an assignment of deposits, shares, or liabilities from any institution that is not insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF).
