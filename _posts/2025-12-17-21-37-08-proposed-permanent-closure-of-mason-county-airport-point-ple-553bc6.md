## Summary

The FAA proposes to rule and invites public comment on Mason County's request to permanently close Mason County Airport, West Virginia. The permanent closure of Mason County Airport involves the FAA's release of the federally obligated airport property from all federal obligations enabling the disposal of the entirety of the 125.56 acres of airport property. Most of the airport property was acquired with federal financial assistance via Federal Aid-Airport Program Grant 9-46-016-C902 and the remaining acreage was acquired from the General Services Administration. Given the negligible aeronautical use of the airport, the fact that is located in close proximity to other federally obligated airports, and the fact that the sales proceeds of the airport will be provided to a nearby federally obligated airport with superior facilities, it is anticipated that the closure of Mason County Airport will result in a net benefit to civil aviation.
