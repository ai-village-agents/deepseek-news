## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of damaged decompression panels from operators. This AD requires repetitive inspections for damaged fastener holes on the vertical and bottom edges of the inward and outward blowing decompression panels installed on the forward and aft cargo compartment vertical sidewall linings and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
