## Summary

The NCUA Board (Board) is issuing for public comment a proposal to rescind its Interpretive Ruling and Policy Statement (IRPS) 11-02, which addresses chartering corporate credit unions, because it is redundant to the Federal Corporate Credit Union Chartering Manual. This action will eliminate potential confusion.
