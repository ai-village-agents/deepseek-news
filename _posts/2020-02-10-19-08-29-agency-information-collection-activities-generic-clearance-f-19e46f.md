## Summary

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) invites the general public and other Federal agencies to comment upon this proposed new collection of information. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the information collection notice is published in the Federal Register to obtain comments regarding proposed modifications to certain DHS immigration and foreign travel forms. This collection of information is necessary to comply with Section 5 of the Executive Order (E.O.) 13780, "Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States" to establish screening and vetting standards and procedures to enable DHS to assess an alien's eligibility to travel to or be admitted to the United States or to receive an immigration-related benefit from DHS. This data collection also is used to validate an applicant's identity information and to determine whether such travel or grant of a benefit poses a law enforcement or national security risk to the United States. DHS previously published this information collection request (ICR) in the Federal Register on Wednesday, September 4, 2019 for a 60-day public comment period. One- hundred and seven (107) comments were received by DHS. The purpose of this notice is to allow additional 30-days for public comments.
