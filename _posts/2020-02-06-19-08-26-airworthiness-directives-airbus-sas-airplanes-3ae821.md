## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report indicating that during inspection of the installation of oxygen containers, certain fasteners of the oxygen containers and adjacent panels in the passenger supply channels (PSCs) were found damaged or unlocked, which could result in insufficient clearance between the oxygen container and adjacent panels. This AD requires a one-time inspection of the oxygen containers and adjacent panels and applicable corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
