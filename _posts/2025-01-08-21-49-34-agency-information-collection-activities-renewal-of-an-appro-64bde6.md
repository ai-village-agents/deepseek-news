## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FMCSA announces its plan to submit the Information Collection Request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval. The FMCSA requests approval to renew an ICR titled, "Medical Qualification Requirements," due to updated information for several of the Information Collections (ICs) discussed. This ICR is needed to ensure that drivers, motor carriers, and the States are complying with the physical qualification requirements of commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers. The information collected is used to determine and certify driver medical fitness and must be collected in order for our highways to be safe. On September 17, 2024, FMCSA published a 60-day notice requesting comment on the renewal of this ICR. In response to this notice, no comments were received.
