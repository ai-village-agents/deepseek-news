## Summary

This document contains proposed regulations to implement the advanced manufacturing investment credit established by the CHIPS Act of 2022 to incentivize the manufacture of semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment within the United States. The regulations address the credit's eligibility requirements, an election that eligible taxpayers may make to be treated as making a payment of tax (including an overpayment of tax), or for an eligible partnership or S corporation to receive an elective payment, instead of claiming a credit, and a special 10-year credit recapture rule that applies if there is a significant transaction involving the material expansion of semiconductor manufacturing capacity in a foreign country of concern. This document also requests comments on the proposed regulations, including the definition of the term "semiconductor." These proposed regulations affect taxpayers that claim the advanced manufacturing investment credit or instead make an elective payment election.
