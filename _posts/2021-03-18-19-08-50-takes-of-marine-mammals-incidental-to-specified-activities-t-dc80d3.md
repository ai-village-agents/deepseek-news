## Summary

NMFS has received a request from Halibut Point Marine Services, LLC (HPMS) for an incidental harassment authorization (IHA) that would cover a subset of the take authorized in an IHA previously issued HPMS to incidentally take marine mammals, by Level A and Level B harassment only, during construction activities associated with the Old Sitka Dock North Dolphins Expansion Project in Sitka, Alaska. Some changes have occurred during this year's evaluation of the project. Pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), NMFS is requesting comments on its proposal to issue an IHA to incidentally take marine mammals during the specified activities. NMFS is also requesting comments on a possible one-year renewal IHA that could be issued under certain circumstances and if all requirements are met, as described in Request for Public Comments at the end of this notice. NMFS will consider public comments prior to making any final decision on the issuance of the requested MMPA authorizations and agency responses will be summarized in the final notice of our decision.
