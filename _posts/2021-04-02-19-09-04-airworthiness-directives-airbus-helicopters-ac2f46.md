## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 82-20-05 for Societe Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale (now Airbus Helicopters) Model AS-350 and AS-355 series helicopters. AD 82-20-05 required inspecting and establishing a life limit for the tail rotor (TR) drive shaft bearing (bearing). This new AD requires replacing certain part-numbered TR bearings with one part-numbered bearing and repetitively inspecting one part-numbered bearing. This AD was prompted by inconsistencies that have been identified between inspections and maintenance actions required by ADs and inspections and maintenance actions specified in the applicable maintenance manual. The actions of this AD are intended to address an unsafe condition on these products.
