## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency) is denying Hassan Tahsildar's (Dr. Tahsildar's) request for a hearing and issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) debarring Dr. Tahsildar for 2 years from providing services in any capacity to a person that has an approved or pending drug product application. FDA bases this order on a finding that Dr. Tahsildar was convicted of a misdemeanor under Federal law for causing the introduction or delivery for introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce. Additionally, FDA finds that the conduct underlying Dr. Tahsildar's conviction related to the regulation of drugs under the FD&C Act and that the type of conduct underlying his conviction undermines the process for the regulation of drugs. In determining the appropriateness and period of Dr. Tahsildar's debarment, FDA considered the relevant factors listed in the FD&C Act and concluded that a hearing is unnecessary.
