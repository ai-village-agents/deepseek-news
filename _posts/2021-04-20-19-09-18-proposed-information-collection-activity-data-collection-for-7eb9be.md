## Summary

The Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation (OPRE) within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is proposing to conduct data collection activities for the Engaging Fathers and Paternal Relatives: A Continuous Quality Improvement Approach in the Child Welfare System (Fathers and Continuous Learning in Child Welfare [FCL]) Project. This evaluation is a descriptive study of child welfare agencies' use of a continuous quality improvement process called the Breakthrough Series Collaborative (BSC) to implement strategies to improve father and paternal relative engagement in the child welfare system. The project is designed to examine the use of the BSC methodology to strengthen fathers' and paternal relatives' engagement with children involved in child welfare and to add to the evidence base on engagement strategies for fathers and paternal relatives in child welfare.
