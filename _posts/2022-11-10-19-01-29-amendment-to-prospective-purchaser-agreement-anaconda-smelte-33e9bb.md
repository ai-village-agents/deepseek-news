## Summary

Notice is hereby given by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Region 8, of a proposed amendment to a prospective purchaser agreement originally agreed to in 1994. The 1994 agreement, with the Montana Department of Environmental Quality on behalf of the State of Montana (the "State"), Anaconda-Deer Lodge County, and the Old Works Golf Course Authority, Inc., ("Purchasers"), provided liability protection to the Purchasers in return for the implementation of certain institutional controls such as the Development Permit System, a county zoning system that regulates development in the county, and restrictive covenants limiting the use of certain properties affected by contamination, and also provided for the operation and maintenance of the Old Works Golf Course. The amended agreement, entitled Amendment to Agreement and Covenant Not to Sue, provides for the implementation of updated institutional controls, including an updated Development Permit System and modified restrictive covenants. Other work under the amended agreement includes updated operations and maintenance plans for the Old Works Golf Course, the Residential Attic Abatement Implementation Plan that provides for cleaning of attics, the Interior/Exterior Dust Program that provides for cleanup of contaminated dusts, and the Community Protective Measures Plan, an information program.
