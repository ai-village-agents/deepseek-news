## Summary

This action proposes to establish restricted areas R-5306G and R-5306H at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Cherry Point, NC. The proposed restricted areas would overlie the amended restricted areas R- 5306C and R-5306D and the existing R-5306E. This action also proposes minor amendments of 2 latitude/longitude coordinates in R-5306C and R- 5306D to align with a refined 3 nautical mile boundary line off the coast, and controlling agency change for R-5306A, R-5306C, R-5306D, and R-5306E to MCAS Cherry Point CERAP. Due to altitude constraints, the existing restricted airspace structure around MCAS Cherry Point cannot fully support the training requirements for current 4th or 5th generation aircraft such as the F-18 and F-35. The proposed restricted areas would provide realistic training to enable pilots and aircrews to deliver real or simulated laser-guided precision guided munitions (PGM) from realistic altitudes.
