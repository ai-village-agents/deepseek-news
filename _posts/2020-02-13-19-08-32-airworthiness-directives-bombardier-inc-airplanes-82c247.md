## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-2C10 (Regional Jet Series 700, 701 & 702) airplanes; Model CL-600-2D15 (Regional Jet Series 705) airplanes; Model CL-600-2D24 (Regional Jet Series 900) airplanes; and Model CL- 600-2E25 (Regional Jet Series 1000) airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of incorrectly installed flight compartment door edge protection plates on both sides of the upper decompression panel. This AD requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate a functional check of the flight compartment door decompression latches. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
