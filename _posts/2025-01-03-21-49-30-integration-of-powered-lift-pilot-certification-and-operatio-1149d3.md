## Summary

On November 21, 2024, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published a final rule titled "Integration of Powered-Lift: Pilot Certification and Operations; Miscellaneous Amendments Related to Rotorcraft and Airplanes" (RIN 2120-AL72). That final rule inadvertently duplicated two tables in the regulatory text of the Special Federal Aviation Regulation for powered-lift. This correction removes the duplicates. Additionally, the FAA inadvertently cited an incorrect paragraph in the Training center instructor eligibility requirements section of the Code of Federal Regulations. This correction corrects the paragraph reference.
