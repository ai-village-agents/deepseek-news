## Summary

On December 10, 2021, the Department of Commerce (Commerce) published its notice of initiation and preliminary results of changed circumstances review (CCR) of the antidumping duty (AD) order on heavy walled rectangular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes (HWR pipes and tubes) from the Republic of Turkey (Turkey). Commerce preliminarily determined that Ozdemir Boru Profil Sanayi ve Ticaret Sirketi (A.S.) (Ozdemir AS) is the successor-in-interest to Ozdemir Boru Profil Sanayi ve Ticaret Limited Sirketi (Ozdemir Ltd. Sti.), and, as a result, should be accorded the same treatment previously accorded to that company. We invited interested parties to comment on the preliminary results. As no parties submitted comments, and there is no other information or evidence on the record calling into question our preliminary results, Commerce is making no changes to the preliminary results. For these final results, Commerce continues to find that Ozdemir AS is the successor-in-interest to Ozdemir Ltd. Sti.
