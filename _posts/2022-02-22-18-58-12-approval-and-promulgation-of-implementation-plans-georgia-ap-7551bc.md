## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is correcting statements contained in a July 11, 2002, Federal Register notice of direct final rulemaking approving changes to the Georgia State Implementation Plan (SIP). Specifically, EPA stated that it was approving a change to the public notice requirements in Georgia's SIP for federally-enforceable operating permits. However, this change was never effective at the state level and, therefore, was never incorporated into the SIP. EPA is publishing this correction notice to eliminate any potential confusion regarding the public notice requirements in Georgia's SIP for these permits.
