## Summary

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) invites public comment on one currently approved Information Collection Request (ICR), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number 1652-0053, abstracted below that we will submit to the OMB for an extension in compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected burden. The collection involves applications for entities choosing to participate in TSA's Certified Cargo Screening Program (CCSP), including Certified Cargo Screening Facilities (CCSFs) and Certified Cargo Screening Facilities-Canine (CCSFs-K9). TSA is seeking an extension of this ICR for the continuation of the CCSP in order to secure aircraft carrying cargo.
