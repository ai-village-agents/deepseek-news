## Summary

The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is amending the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by adding 31 persons to the Unverified List (UVL). The 31 persons are added to the UVL on the basis that BIS was unable to verify their bona fides because an end-use check could not be completed satisfactorily for reasons outside the U.S. Government's control. All 31 persons are being added under the destination of the People's Republic of China (China). This rule also removes nine persons, all under the destination of China, from the UVL because BIS was able to verify their bona fides. With this final rule, BIS also clarifies the activities and criteria that may lead to the addition of an entity to the Entity List, including a sustained lack of cooperation by the host government (e.g., the government of the country in which an end-use check is to be conducted) that effectively prevents BIS from determining compliance with the EAR.
