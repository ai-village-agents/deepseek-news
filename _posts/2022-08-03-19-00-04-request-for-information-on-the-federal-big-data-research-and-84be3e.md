## Summary

On July 1, 2022, the NITRD NCO and NSF, as part of the NITRD Big Data interagency working group (BD IWG), published in the Federal Register a document entitled "Request for Information on the Federal Big Data Research and Development Strategic Plan Update". Through this RFI, the NITRD NCO seeks input from the public, including academia, government, business, and industry groups of all sizes; those directly performing Big Data research and development (R&D); and those directly affected by such R&D, on ways in which the strategic plan should be revised and improved. The public input provided in response to this RFI will assist the NITRD BD IWG in updating the Federal Big Data Research and Development Strategic Plan. In response to requests by prospective commenters that they would benefit from additional time to adequately consider and respond to the RFI, the NITRD NCO and NSF have determined that an extension of the comment period until August 17, 2022, is appropriate.
