## Summary

The Coast Guard is amending its special local regulations for recurring marine parades, regattas, and other events in Southern California Annual Marine Events for the San Diego Captain of the Port Zone. This final rule will add one new recurring special local regulation for the San Diego Fleet Week Veterans Day Boat Parade. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on the navigable waters during the annual event, and will restrict vessel traffic in the designated areas during the event unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Sector San Diego or a designated representative.
