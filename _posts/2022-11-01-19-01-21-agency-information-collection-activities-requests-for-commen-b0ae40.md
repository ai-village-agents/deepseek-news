## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on May 18, 2022. The information collection is reported voluntarily by those who wish to report suspected unapproved parts (SUP) to the FAA for review. The information is used to determine if an unapproved part investigation is warranted.
