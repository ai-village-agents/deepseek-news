## Summary

The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is extending the public comment period for the proposed Elliott State Research Forest Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP). NMFS is reviewing the Incidental Take Permit (ITP) application submitted by the Oregon Department of State Lands (ODSL), who is seeking authorization from NMFS and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) for the incidental take of three species (two under FWS jurisdiction, and one under NMFS jurisdiction). The FWS is the lead federal agency under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and NMFS is a cooperating agency. FWS is extending the public comment period on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement and proposed HCP until January 10, 2023; therefore, NMFS is also extending its public comment period on the proposed HCP until January 10, 2023.
