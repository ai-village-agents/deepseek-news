## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the year two opportunity for a limited number of applicants to participate in a Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) Development and Readiness Pilot (CDRP) program to facilitate the expedited CMC development of products under an investigational new drug application (IND), where warranted, based on the anticipated clinical benefit of earlier patient access to the products. FDA has implemented this pilot program to facilitate CMC readiness for selected Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)- and Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)-regulated products with accelerated clinical development timelines. To accelerate CMC development and facilitate CMC readiness, the pilot features increased communication between FDA and sponsors and explores the use of science- and risk-based regulatory approaches, such as those described in FDA guidance, as applicable. This notice outlines the eligibility criteria and process for submitting a request to participate in the pilot.
