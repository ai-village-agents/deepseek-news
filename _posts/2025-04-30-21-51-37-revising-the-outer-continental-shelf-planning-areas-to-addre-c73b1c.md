## Summary

This notice informs the public that the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has made modifications to its Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) planning areas, which are geographic subdivisions of the OCS that BOEM uses for planning and administrative purposes for oil and gas activities. The OCS Lands Act (OCSLA) is the primary authority that provides BOEM with jurisdiction covering the entire OCS. As described below, changes to the boundaries of this jurisdiction have occurred since BOEM last established these subdivisions, and BOEM has modified its planning areas to account for these changes. As a result, the total number of OCS planning areas has increased from 26 to 27. The total acreage for the OCS planning areas has decreased, from approximately 1.72 billion acres to 1.68 billion acres, which does not include the OCS offshore the U.S. Territories and Hawaii. The U.S. Territories and Hawaii OCS areas, accounting for approximately 1.48 billion acres, are not considered for oil and gas leasing, so have not been designated as "planning areas." Additional information can be found at https:// www.boem.gov/oil-gas-energy/leasing/outer-continental-shelf.
