## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) proposes to amend the test procedure for consumer water heaters and residential-duty commercial water heaters to update the procedure to the latest versions of the industry standards that are incorporated by reference and to consider procedures that are included in a draft industry standard, which is not currently incorporated by reference. DOE also proposes to interpret the statutory definition of consumer water heater to cover larger capacity heat pump type units as commercial equipment and proposes several new definitions for water heaters that cannot be appropriately tested with the current DOE test procedure, along with test methods to test these products. DOE is seeking comment from interested parties on the proposals.
