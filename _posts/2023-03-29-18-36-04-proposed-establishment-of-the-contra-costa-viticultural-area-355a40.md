## Summary

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to establish the approximately 167,146-acre "Contra Costa" American viticultural area (AVA) in Contra Costa County, California. Only the westernmost portion of the proposed AVA would lie in the established San Francisco Bay and Central Coast AVAs. To avoid this partial overlap, TTB proposes to expand the boundary of the established San Francisco Bay and Central Coast AVAs to entirely encompass the proposed Contra Costa AVA. The proposed expansions would add approximately 109,955 acres to each of the established AVAs. TTB designates viticultural areas to allow vintners to better describe the origin of their wines and to allow consumers to better identify wines they may purchase. TTB invites comments on these proposals.
