## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain CFM International, S.A. (CFM) LEAP-1A23, LEAP-1A24, LEAP- 1A24E1, LEAP-1A26, LEAP-1A26CJ, LEAP-1A26E1, LEAP-1A29, LEAP-1A29CJ, LEAP-1A30, LEAP-1A32, LEAP-1A33, LEAP-1A33B2, and LEAP-1A35A model turbofan engines. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a manufacturing quality escape found during an inspection of a high- pressure turbine (HPT) case. This proposed AD would require the removal from service of the affected HPT case. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
