## Summary

The FAA is removing Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-13-07, which applied to certain Saab AB, Support and Services Model SAAB 340B airplanes. AD 2023-13-07 required amending the applicable airplane flight manual (AFM) by incorporating a temporary revision (TR) to reduce the maximum take-off weight (MTOW). The FAA issued AD 2023-13-07 to address the possibility of flight in an uncertified envelope, which could result in reduced structural capability and reduced controllability of the airplane. Since the FAA issued AD 2023-13-07, a determination was made that affected airplanes can be safely operated up to the initially published MTOW. Accordingly, AD 2023-13-07 is removed.
