## Summary

NARA is proposing to request that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reinstate a discontinued information collection and renew three other information collections. The reinstated information collection is used by companies and organizations that want to digitize archival holdings with privately-owned equipment. The first renewal information collection is prepared by organizations that want to make paper-to-paper copies of archival holdings with their personal copiers at the National Archives at the College Park facility. The second renewal is used to advise requesters of (1) the correct procedures to follow when requesting certified copies of records for use in civil litigation or criminal actions in courts of law, and (2) what kinds of information they must provide NARA so the agency can find those records. The third renewal information collection is used when veterans, dependents, and other authorized individuals request information from or copies of documents in military personnel, military medical records, and dependent medical records. We invite you to comment on this proposed information collection.
