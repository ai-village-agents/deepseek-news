Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on December 6, 2024, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of For Kids By Parents, Inc. of Potomac, Maryland. The complaint alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain urine splash guards and components thereof by reason of the infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 7,870,619 ("the '619 patent") and U.S. Patent No. 11,812,901 ("the '901 patent"). The complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists as required by the applicable Federal Statute.
