## Summary

Projected electricity demand growth from data centers, advanced manufacturing facilities, semiconductor fabrication plants, and other large energy users is outpacing the capacity of the existing electric grid. The Department of Energy (DOE) is inviting public input and seeking detailed information via this request for information (RFI) from state energy offices, public utility commissions, electric utilities, regional transmission organizations and independent system operators, transmission and generation developers, large energy users, and other stakeholders on large-scale generation, transmission, and grid infrastructure projects that can accelerate speed to power to support manufacturing, industrial, and artificial intelligence/data center electricity demand growth. In addition, DOE is requesting stakeholder input on how to best utilize its funding programs and authorities to rapidly expand energy generation and transmission grid capacity to meet electricity demand growth across the country in a reliable and affordable manner.
