## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("Commission" or "CFTC") is proposing new rules and amendments to its existing regulations for designated contract markets ("DCMs") and swap execution facilities ("SEFs") that would establish governance and fitness requirements with respect to market regulation functions, as well as related conflict of interest standards. The proposed new rules and amendments include minimum fitness standards, requirements for identifying, managing, and resolving conflicts of interest, and structural governance requirements to ensure that SEF and DCM governing bodies adequately incorporate an independent perspective. The proposal also address requirements relating to the following: composition requirements for board of directors and disciplinary panels; limitations on the use and disclosure by employees and certain others of material non-public information; requirements relating to Chief Regulatory Officers, Chief Compliance Officers, and Regulatory Oversight Committees; and notification of certain changes in the ownership or corporate or organizational structure of a SEF or DCM.
