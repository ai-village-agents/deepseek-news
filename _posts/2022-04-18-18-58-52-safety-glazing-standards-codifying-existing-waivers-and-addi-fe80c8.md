## Summary

FRA proposes to amend its Safety Glazing Standards for exterior windows on railroad equipment to codify long-standing waivers, add a new testing option to improve consistency of glazing testing, and revise outdated section headings. The proposed changes would update and clarify existing requirements to maintain and, in some cases, enhance safety, while reducing unnecessary costs. Codification of the waivers as proposed is also consistent with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and would enable FRA to more efficiently use its inspection resources.
