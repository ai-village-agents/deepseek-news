# Airworthiness Directives; Bombardier, Inc., Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-1A10 and BD-700-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of the passenger door failing to dampen during opening at regularly scheduled maintenance checks, causing the door to open more rapidly than normal. An investigation found that a contributing factor was erroneous aircraft maintenance manual (AMM) procedures. This proposed AD would prohibit using certain versions of certain aircraft maintenance manual (AMM) tasks for the passenger door. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
