## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-13- 08, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2018-13-08 required repetitive inspections for cracking of the radius of the front spar vertical stringers and the horizontal floor beam on frame (FR) 36, repetitive inspections for cracking of the fastener holes of the front spar vertical stringers on FR 36, and repair if necessary, and, for certain airplanes, a potential terminating action modification of the center wing box area. This AD was prompted by a determination that additional airplanes are subject to the unsafe condition. This AD revises the applicability by adding airplanes and retains the requirements of AD 2018-13-08; as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
