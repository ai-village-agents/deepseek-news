## Summary

In light of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit recently granting a petition for review of a final rule published by the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") on January 19, 2022, and remanding the matter to DOE for further proceedings, DOE is initiating an information and data gathering effort on whether "short- cycle" product classes for dishwashers, residential clothes washers, and consumer clothes dryers are warranted under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. In this request for information, DOE solicits data and information from the public to help DOE in its rulemaking to evaluate whether: products with a "short cycle" as the normal cycle are available in the market; and products with a "short cycle" as the normal cycle should be subject to different standards than products without a "short cycle" as the normal cycle.
