## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has received a petition for rulemaking from Richard Arnold and Ron Johnson on behalf of the Tribal Radioactive Materials Transportation Committee, dated December 4, 2020, requesting that the NRC revise its regulations to ensure consistency regarding advance Tribal notification of certain radioactive material shipments with similar regulations for State notification. The petition was docketed by the NRC on February 11, 2021, and has been assigned Docket No. PRM-37-2. The NRC is examining the issues raised in PRM-37-2 to determine whether they should be considered in rulemaking. The NRC is requesting public comment on this petition at this time.
