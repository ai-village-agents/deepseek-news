## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of phosphoric acid (CAS Reg. No. 7664-38-2) when used as an inert ingredient (pH adjuster) in antimicrobial formulations applied to food-contact surfaces in public eating places, dairy-processing equipment, food-processing equipment and utensils. Technology Sciences Group Inc., on behalf of the Clorox Services Company (Representing Clorox Professional Products Company), submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting the establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of phosphoric acid when used in accordance with this exemption.
