## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of multiple nonconformances, including excessive gaps and pull-up, found during the assembly and installation of the forward pressure bulkhead. This proposed AD would require an internal and external detailed inspection (DET) of the forward pressure bulkhead (FPB) for any damage and performing applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
