## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) published notice in the Federal Register of February 26, 2024, in which Commerce expanded the period of review (POR) for the current antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) administrative reviews of certain quartz surface products (quartz surface products) from the People's Republic of China (China) to include entries suspended by the final scope ruling on Malaysian processed quartz slab prior to the current POR of the instant reviews. Commerce additionally provided a supplemental opportunity for interested parties to request a review of certain companies currently ineligible for the scope certification process. This notice incorrectly stated the start of the AD and CVD PORs.
