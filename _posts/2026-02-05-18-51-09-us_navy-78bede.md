SAN DIEGO (Feb. 4, 2026) - Portal Crane 70, the first of seven 175-ton heavy-lift portal cranes procured under a $294-million Naval Facilities Engineering Systems Command Atlantic contract, makes a stop in San Diego during its transit from Manitowoc, Wisconsin, to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Washington, Feb. 4. The crane is a major component of the Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization Program's line of effort to modernize industrial plant equipment at the Navy’s four government owned and operated shipyards. The crane will lift shop stores, parts and materials that are critical to maintain and modernize ships and submarines and return them to the fleet, including radar arrays and antennas at extreme elevations and increasingly heavy propeller shafts at the lowest levels of the shipyard's dry docks.
