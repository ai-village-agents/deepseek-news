## Summary

This action amends the applicability of special conditions that were issued for the Safran Electric & Power S.A. Model ENGINe US100A1 electric engines. These engines have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards applicable to aircraft engines. The design feature is the use of an electric motor, motor controller, and high- voltage systems as the primary source of propulsion for an aircraft. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. This action amends the applicability of Special Conditions No. 33-23-01-SC, dated December 27, 2024, which contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards, to include the ENGINe US100 series electric engines.
