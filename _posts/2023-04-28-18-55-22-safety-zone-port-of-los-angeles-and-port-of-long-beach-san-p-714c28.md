## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary moving safety zone around the M/V ZHEN HUA 26 while it transits from the Port of Long Beach, CA, from Long Beach Container Terminal (LBCT), LB Berth E22, to inner anchorage, and then to Fenix Marine Services (FMS), LA Berth 302. This safety zone is necessary to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards associated with oversized cargo of ship-to-shore gantry cranes which extend more than 200 feet out from the transiting vessel. Entry of persons or vessels into this safety zone is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port (COTP) Los Angeles--Long Beach, or their designated representative. The Coast Guard recently issued a safety zone for the transit of the M/V ZHEN HUA 26, but additional time is needed to complete the cargo delivery.
