## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited Model DHC-8-401 and - 402 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports that the saddle washer (radius filler) for the front and rear spar joints may have been incorrectly manufactured for several years. This AD requires inspecting the horizontal stabilizer to vertical joint for gaps and bending of the saddle washer and adjacent washers, and replacing parts if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
