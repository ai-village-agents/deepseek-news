## Summary

FRA is requiring the installation of inward- and outward- facing locomotive image recording devices on all lead locomotives in passenger trains, as required by the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act). In general, the final rule requires that these devices record while a lead locomotive is in motion and retain the data in a crashworthy memory module. The rule also treats locomotive-mounted recording devices on passenger locomotives as "safety devices" under existing Federal railroad safety regulations to prohibit tampering with or disabling them. Further, this rule governs the use of passenger locomotive recordings to conduct operational tests to determine passenger railroad operating employees' compliance with applicable railroad rules and Federal regulations. Finally, this rule requires Texas Central Railroad (TCRR) to install and maintain trainset image recording systems appropriate to TCRR's operation.
