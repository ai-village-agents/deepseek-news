## Summary

The FAA is reopening the comment period for an earlier proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for certain Bell Textron Canada Limited (type certificate previously held by Bell Helicopter Textron Canada Limited) Model 206L series helicopters. The NPRM proposed to require replacing certain low fuel level detector switch units (switch units) and testing certain other switch units to determine if replacement is required. The NPRM was prompted by a manufacturing flaw that could cause the switch units to hang in the high position and fail to indicate a low fuel condition. This action reopens the comment period because a significant amount of time has elapsed since the NPRM was published. This action also revises the NPRM by updating the type certificate holder's name, updating the estimated cost information, clarifying and expanding the applicability, clarifying the requirements, adding a compliance time, and adding parts installation prohibitions. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive (AD) to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over those in the NPRM, the agency is requesting comments on this SNPRM.
