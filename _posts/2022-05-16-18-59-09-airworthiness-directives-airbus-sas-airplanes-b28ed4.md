## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-13- 06, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. AD 2021-13-06 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-13- 06, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2021-13-06 and requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate additional new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
