## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC). This SIP revision consists of the 2010 amendments to the State of Delaware's Mobile Equipment Repair and Refinishing (MERR) regulations to incorporate the Ozone Transport Commission's (OTC) 2009 Motor Vehicle and Mobile Equipment Non-Assembly Line Coating Operations regulations (MVMERR) model rule. The MVMERR rule establishes updated volatile organic compounds (VOC) content limits for coating and cleaning solvents used in vehicle refinishing and standards for coating application, work practices, monitoring, and recordkeeping. EPA is approving these revisions to the Delaware SIP in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
