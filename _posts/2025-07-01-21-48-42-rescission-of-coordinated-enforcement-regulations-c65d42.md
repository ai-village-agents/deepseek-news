# Rescission of Coordinated Enforcement Regulations

## Summary

The Department of Labor (the Department or DOL) proposes to remove the regulations that set forth the procedures within the Department for the coordination of enforcement activities by the Wage and Hour Division (WHD), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) relating to migrant farmworkers. The Department is proposing this removal because these regulations limit the Department's discretion, impose unnecessary and duplicative internal procedures, and prevent the Department's agencies from coordinating with regard to migrant farmworkers in more efficient, effective ways.
