## Summary

VA proposes to amend its regulations that govern the VA Health Professional Scholarship Program (HPSP) by implementing the mandates of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, which would expand the number of scholarships available to those who are pursuing degrees or training in mental health disciplines. We also propose to make a technical correction under the Paperwork Reduction Act section to correct an approved OMB control number.
