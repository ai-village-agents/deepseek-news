## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; Model A319 series airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, -233, -251N, -252N, - 253N, -271N, -272N, and -273N airplanes; and Model A321 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that certain overheat detection system (OHDS) sensing elements installed at certain positions might not properly detect thermal bleed leak events due to a quality escape during the manufacturing process. This AD requires a one-time detailed inspection of each affected part installed at an affected position and replacement if necessary, and prohibits the installation of affected parts at affected positions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
