## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is extending the comment period for the proposed rule published in the Federal Register on November 8, 2019. The comment period is scheduled to close on January 17, 2020. SBA is extending the comment period an additional 21 days in response to the significant level of interest generated by the proposed rule and requests from multiple stakeholders for an extension. Given the scope of the proposed rule and the nature of the issues raised by the comments received to date, SBA believes that affected businesses need more time to review the proposal and prepare their comments.
