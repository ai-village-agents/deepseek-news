## Summary

This notice provides updated Administrative Guidelines (Guidelines) and requirements for Project-Based Voucher (PBV) Subsidy Layering Reviews (SLRs) and SLR requirements for Mixed-Finance projects that may or may not include PBV assistance. This updated notice provides transparency on HUD's expectations regarding cash flow, debt coverage ratios, net operating income, operating expense trending requirements, and expands guidance related to expense coverage ratios, when projects do not have hard debt. This notice also introduces a new mailbox (PBVSLRs@hud.gov) for SLRs requests to be performed by HUD HQ, and for SLR certifications and supporting documentation for SLRs the Housing Credit Agencies (HCAs) completed. Finally, the guidance expands the delegation of SLRs to HCAs to cases where PBV assistance is combined with other government assistance. Previously, the delegation only covered cases that included Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTCs). Otherwise SLR cases had to be completed by HUD (see overview chart in Section IV).
