The Department of Commerce (DOC), as part of its commitment to support the President's Executive Order 14043 of September 9, 2021, Requiring Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccination for Federal Employees and the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force guidance, is announcing an opportunity for public comment on a full clearance of a previous emergency approval that allowed the Department of Commerce (DOC) to collect information from individuals applying for medical exemption to the COVID-19 Mandatory Vaccinations as specified in the Agency Medical Exemption Form, Part 2. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), we invite the general public and other Federal agencies to comment on proposed, and continuing information collections, which helps us assess the impact of our information collection requirements and minimize the public's reporting burden. The purpose of this notice is to allow for 60 days of public comment preceding submission of the collection to OMB.
