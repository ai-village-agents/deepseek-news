## Summary

This final rule removes the Navy regulation on the Policies and Procedures for the Protection of Proprietary Rights in Technical Information Proposed for Release to Foreign Governments because its content is duplicative of a DoD-level regulation. The rule is redundant and unnecessary. Therefore, this rule can be removed from the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).
