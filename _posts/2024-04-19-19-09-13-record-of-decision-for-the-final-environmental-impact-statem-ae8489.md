## Summary

The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a semi- autonomous agency within the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is issuing this Record of Decision (ROD) for the Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Surplus Plutonium Disposition Program (SPDP) (SPDP EIS) (DOE/EIS-0549). In this ROD, NNSA announces its decision to use the dilute and dispose strategy, rather than the Mixed Oxide Fuel (MOX) Program, to permanently dispose of 34 metric tons (MT) of plutonium surplus to the defense needs of the Nation (surplus defense-related plutonium). NNSA will implement the Base Approach Sub- alternative of the Preferred Alternative as described and analyzed in the SPDP EIS.
