## Summary

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) announces the availability of a revised version of its "Methodology for Determining Average Prime Offer Rates," which describes the data and methodology used to calculate the average prime offer rate (APOR) for purposes of Regulation C and Regulation Z. The methodology statement has been revised to address the imminent unavailability of certain data the CFPB previously relied on to calculate APORs, as a result of a recent decision by Freddie Mac to make changes to its Primary Mortgage Market Survey[supreg] (PMMS). The CFPB has identified a suitable temporary alternative source of the relevant data and will begin relying on those data to calculate APORs on or after April 21, 2023.
