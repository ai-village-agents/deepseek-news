## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited Model DHC-8-401 and - 402 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of a possible hard contact between the #2 top high level sensor (HLS) terminal screw head and the #6 outer wing fuel access panel stiffener flange. This AD requires removing and replacing or reworking the #6 outer wing fuel access panel assembly. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
