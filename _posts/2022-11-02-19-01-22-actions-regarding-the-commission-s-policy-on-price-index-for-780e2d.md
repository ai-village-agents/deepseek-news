## Summary

On April 21, 2022, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) revised its price index policy set forth in its Policy Statement on Natural Gas and Electric Price Indices (Revised Policy Statement). In order to comply with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Paperwork Reduction Act requirements on Policy Statements, the Commission is establishing a new information collection, FERC-549E, (Price Index Data Providers and Developers) OMB No. 1902-New, to reflect the burden to implement the policy changes in the Revised Policy Statement and to reflect the unreported burden arising from the prior policy statements. The Commission is also seeking comment on the burden and cost related to complying with the Revised Policy Statement.
