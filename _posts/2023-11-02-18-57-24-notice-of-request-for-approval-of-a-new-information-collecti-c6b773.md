## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice announces the Agricultural Marketing Service's intent to request approval for a new information collection from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under OMB control No. 0581-NEW. This notice is based on a recommendation from the California Walnut Board (Board) to establish voluntary reporting for walnuts exempt from assessments under Federal marketing order no. 984, walnuts grown in California. This action would create a new form supplied by the Board to California walnut handlers to voluntarily report deliveries of walnuts exempt from assessments. The new form will be merged with the forms currently approved under OMB No. 0581-0178 Vegetable and Specialty Crops.
