## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to find that the Illinois portion of the Chicago-Naperville, IL-IN-WI area (Chicago area) is attaining the 2008 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS or standard) and to act in accordance with a request from Illinois submitted on January 25, 2022 to redesignate the Illinois portion of the Chicago area to attainment for the 2008 ozone NAAQS because the request meets the statutory requirements for redesignation under the Clean Air Act (CAA). EPA is proposing to approve, as a revision to the Illinois State Implementation Plan (SIP), the State's plan for maintaining the 2008 ozone NAAQS through 2035 in the Illinois portion of the Chicago area. EPA finds adequate and is proposing to approve the 2035 volatile organic compound (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) Motor Vehicle Emission Budgets (Budgets) for the Illinois portion of the Chicago area. Pursuant to section 110 and part D of the CAA, EPA is proposing to approve the VOC reasonably available control technology (RACT), enhanced motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M), clean-fuel vehicle programs (CFVP), and the enhanced monitoring of ozone and ozone precursors (EMP) SIP revisions submitted by Illinois, because they satisfy serious SIP requirements of the CAA for the Illinois portion of the Chicago area. Finally, EPA is proposing to approve a CAA section 182(f) waiver from NO<INF>X</INF> RACT requirements for the Illinois portion of the Chicago area under the 2008 ozone NAAQS.
