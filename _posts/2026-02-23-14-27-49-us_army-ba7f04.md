A member of the Lithuanian Riflemen’s Union conducts battle drill circulation training during Unified Partners ‘26, Feb. 22, 2026, on General Silvestras Žukauskas Training Area, Pabradė, Lithuania. Unified Partners '26 is a joint training opportunity that promotes and showcases the capabilities of the U.S. Army and the Lithuanian Riflemen’s Union, while reaffirming a shared commitment to collective defense and the strength of the NATO Alliance. EFDL is changing how the U.S. and NATO are planning, resourcing, and training for conflict – it defines how we enhance lethality across NATO land forces. Our adversary’s doctrines rely on mass and momentum. Eastern Flank Deterrence Line (EFDL) turns that strength into a vulnerability. (U.S. Army photo by Spc. Kemarvo Smith)
