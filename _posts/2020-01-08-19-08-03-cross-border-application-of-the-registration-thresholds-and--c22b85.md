## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("Commission" or "CFTC") is publishing for public comment a proposed rule ("Proposed Rule") addressing the cross-border application of certain swap provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act ("CEA or "Act"), as added by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank Act"). Specifically, the Proposed Rule addresses the cross-border application of the registration thresholds and certain requirements applicable to swap dealers ("SDs") and major swap participants ("MSPs"), and establishes a formal process for requesting comparability determinations for such requirements from the Commission. The Commission is proposing a risk-based approach that, consistent with section 2(i) of the CEA, and with due consideration of international comity principles and the Commission's interest in focusing its authority on potential significant risks to the U.S. financial system, would advance the goals of the Dodd-Frank Act's swap reform, while fostering greater liquidity and competitive markets, promoting enhanced regulatory cooperation, and advancing the global harmonization of swap regulation.
