## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) proposes a new Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) system of records entitled: USDA/FSIS-0005, AssuranceNet (ANet). ANet is a Web-based system that collects information to support FSIS' mission through detecting vulnerabilities in food safety systems, processes, and functions so that the potential for harm can be promptly identified, reduced, and eliminated. The information stored in ANet is gathered from various electronic and paper-based sources, and is used to track, measure, and monitor activities and performance. The System also alerts FSIS' management officials to the performance of critical public health and food defense functions; assists in discerning trends; identifies and focuses on areas of high-risk; and helps to determine strategies to combat threats to food safety and food defense. Within ANet, FSIS maintains contact and other identifying information about Federal employees, State employees, contractors of USDA, government officials, and representatives who work at or are associated with the work at meat and poultry establishments and egg products plants.
