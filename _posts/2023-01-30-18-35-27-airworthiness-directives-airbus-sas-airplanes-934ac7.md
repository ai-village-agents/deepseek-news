## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-03-12, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A330-200, -300, -800, and -900 series airplanes; and Model A340-200, -300, -500, and -600 series airplanes. AD 2022-03-12 requires replacing the doghouse door lock placard with an improved instruction placard. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-03-12, it has been determined that additional parts need to be modified. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2022-03-12 and would expand the list of affected parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
