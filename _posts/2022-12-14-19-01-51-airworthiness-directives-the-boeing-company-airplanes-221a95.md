## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report indicating that foreign object debris (FOD) could have been introduced during rework of certain engine fire shutoff switches (EFSSs). This AD requires determining the serial number of the left and right EFSS and replacing affected parts. This AD also limits the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
