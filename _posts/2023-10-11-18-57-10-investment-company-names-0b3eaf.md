## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") is amending the rule under the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act" or "Act") that addresses certain broad categories of investment company names that are likely to mislead investors about an investment company's investments and risks. The amendments to this rule are designed to increase investor protection by improving, and broadening the scope of, the requirement for certain funds to adopt a policy to invest at least 80 percent of the value of their assets in accordance with the investment focus that the fund's name suggests, updating the rule's notice requirements, and establishing recordkeeping requirements. The Commission is also adopting enhanced prospectus disclosure requirements for terminology used in fund names, and additional requirements for funds to report information on Form N-PORT regarding compliance with the names-related regulatory requirements.
