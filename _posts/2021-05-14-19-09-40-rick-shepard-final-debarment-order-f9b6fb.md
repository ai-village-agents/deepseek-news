## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) debarring Rick Shepard for a period of 5 years from importing or offering for import any drug into the United States. FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Shepard was convicted of one felony count under Federal law for conspiracy to import and introduce misbranded drugs into interstate commerce. The factual basis supporting Mr. Shepard's conviction is conduct relating to the importation into the United States of a drug or controlled substance. Mr. Shepard was given notice of the proposed debarment and was given an opportunity to request a hearing to show why he should not be debarred. As of February 14, 2021 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Mr. Shepard had not responded. His failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this matter.
