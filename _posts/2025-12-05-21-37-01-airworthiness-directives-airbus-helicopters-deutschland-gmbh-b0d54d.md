## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH Model MBB-BK 117 D-3 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that certain bolts installed on the horizontal control rods of the flight controls were not dye penetrant inspected for cracks during manufacturing and thus could lead to bolt failure. This proposed AD would require replacement of affected bolts with bolts that are eligible for installation. This proposed AD would also prohibit installing an affected bolt on any helicopter. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
