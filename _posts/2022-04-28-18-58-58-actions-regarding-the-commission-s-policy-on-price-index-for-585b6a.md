## Summary

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is revising its price index policy set forth in its Policy Statement on Natural Gas and Electric Price Indices (Initial Policy Statement) to encourage more market participants to report their transactions to price index developers, to provide greater transparency into the natural gas price formation process, and to increase confidence in the accuracy and reliability of wholesale natural gas prices. First, the Commission is revising the price index policy to allow market participants that report transaction data to price index developers (data providers) to report either their non-index based next-day transactions, their non-index based next-month transactions, or both, to price index developers. In addition, the Commission is revising the price index policy to encourage data providers to report transactions to as many Commission-approved price index developers as possible, and to allow data providers to self-audit on a biennial basis. The Commission is also modifying its standards to state that price index developers should indicate whether a published index price is calculated using market information other than the trades at the index's specified location, or a market assessment, in their published price indices and data distributions. Moreover, the Commission is modifying its standards so that each approved price index developer should seek re-approval from the Commission every seven years to demonstrate that it fully or substantially meets the standards set forth in the Initial Policy Statement. Beginning six months after the effective date of this Revised Policy Statement, interstate natural gas pipelines and public utilities proposing to use price indices in jurisdictional tariffs will no longer be entitled to the rebuttable presumption that a price index developer's price indices produce just and reasonable rates unless the price index developer has obtained approval or re-approval from the Commission within the last seven years. Finally, the Commission is modifying the review period for assessing the liquidity of natural gas price indices submitted for reference in Commission-jurisdictional tariffs to 180 continuous days out of the most recent 365 days. This will help to ensure that price indices referenced in Commission-jurisdictional tariffs are sufficiently liquid.
