## Summary

This rule finalizes, without change, the U.S. Small Business Administration's (SBA or Agency) July 28, 2023, proposed rule to adopt the current statutory alternative size standard for its 7(a) Business and Certified Development Company (CDC/504) Loan Programs (collectively "Business Loan Programs"), subject to a 34.46 percent adjustment for inflation that has occurred since the establishment of the statutory alternative size standard in 2010. The inflation adjustment would increase the size standard's level for tangible net worth to $20 million and for net income to $6.5 million. SBA also is adjusting for inflation the applicable statutory limits for contract size under the Surety Bond Guarantee (SBG) Program. The adjustment increases the contract limit to $9 million and the contract limit for Federal contracts if a Federal contracting officer certifies that such a guarantee is necessary to $14 million.
