## Summary

On March 6, 2024, the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) issued its final judgment in Star Pipe Products v. United States and ASC Engineered Solutions LLC., Court No. 17-00236, Slip Op. 24-28 (CIT March 6, 2024) (Star Pipe Slip Op. 24-28), sustaining the final remand results, of the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce), pertaining to the final scope ruling on certain non-malleable cast iron pipe fittings (pipe fittings) from the People's Republic of China (China). Commerce is therefore amending its Final Scope Ruling to find that ductile iron flanges exported by Star Pipe Products (Star Pipe) are not within the scope of the antidumping (AD) order on pipe fittings from China. Commerce is also notifying the public that the CIT's final judgment is not in harmony with the Final Scope Ruling.
