## Summary

The FDIC, as part of its obligations under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), invites the general public and other Federal agencies to take this opportunity to comment on the survey collection instrument for post examination surveys. FDIC is seeking a new OMB Control Number for this information collection. There are two versions of survey that will be transmitted to each financial institution after FDIC's completion of a Safety and Soundness or a Consumer Compliance examination to obtain feedback from these financial institutions regarding the examination process.
