## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the ASC invites public comments on our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection request entitled "ASC Progress Report Standardized Instructions and Format for Interim and Final Progress Reporting." Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently valid control number issued by OMB. The requirement for grantees to report on performance is OMB's grants policy.
