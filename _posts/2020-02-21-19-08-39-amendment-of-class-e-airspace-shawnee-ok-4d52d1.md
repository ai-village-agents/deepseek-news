## Summary

This action amends the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Chandler Regional Airport, Chandler, OK, and Cushing Municipal Airport, Cushing, OK, which are contained within the Shawnee, OK, airspace legal description. This action is due to an airspace review caused by the decommissioning of the Tilghman and Cushing non-directional beacons (NDB), which provided navigation information for the instrument procedures at these airports.
