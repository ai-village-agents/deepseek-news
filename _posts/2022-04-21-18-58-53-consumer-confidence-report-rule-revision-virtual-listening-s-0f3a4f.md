## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will host a virtual, public, listening session on April 26, 2022.

EPA will also be seeking input from individuals and communities that have historically been, as well as those that currently are, underserved by public health planning, policies, and practices and those communities that are most vulnerable to environmental injustices.
