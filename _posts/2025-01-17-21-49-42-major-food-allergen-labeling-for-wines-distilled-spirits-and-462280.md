## Summary

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to require a labeling disclosure of all major food allergens used in the production of alcohol beverages subject to TTB's regulatory authority under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act. Under the proposed regulations, unless an exception applies, labels must declare milk, eggs, fish, Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, soybeans, and sesame, as well as ingredients that contain protein derived from these foods, if used in the production of the alcohol beverage. TTB proposes a compliance date of 5 years from the date that a final rule resulting from this proposal is published in the Federal Register.
