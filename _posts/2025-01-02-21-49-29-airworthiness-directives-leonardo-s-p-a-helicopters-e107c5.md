## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Leonardo S.p.a. Model AB139 and AW139 helicopters. This AD was prompted by reports of broken main landing gear (MLG) shock absorber piston rod eye ends. This AD requires repetitively inspecting the MLG shock absorber piston rod eye ends, reporting the results of the inspection, and, depending on the results, replacing the MLG shock absorber assembly. It also prohibits installing certain MLG shock absorber assemblies unless specific requirements are met, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
