## Summary

On November 23, 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule titled "Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; State of Arizona; Revised Format for Materials Incorporated by Reference." That publication inadvertently omitted an entry for a regulation approved as part of the Maricopa County portion of the Arizona State Implementation Plan (SIP) and contained certain other errors. The EPA is proposing to correct this omission and to correct the other errors. The regulations affected by this correcting amendment have all been previously submitted by the State of Arizona and approved by the EPA.
