## Summary

On April 1, 2024, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published a final rule in the Federal Register to incorporate certain Airman Certification Standards and Practical Test Standards by reference into the certification requirements for pilots, flight instructors, flight engineers, aircraft dispatchers, and parachute riggers. In that final rule, the FAA incorrectly set forth certain regulatory text which, if not corrected, would remove certain content from the Code of Federal Regulations the FAA did not intend to remove. This correction remedies the error.
