# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Helicopters Model AS332C, AS332C1, AS332L, AS332L1 and AS332L2 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of a crack in the front upper hoist attachment fitting. This proposed AD would require inspecting each affected hoist attachment fitting (fitting) and depending on the results, removing any cracked fitting from service and reporting information. This proposed AD also prohibits installing an affected fitting unless the required actions are accomplished, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
