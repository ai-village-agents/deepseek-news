## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes regulations to establish the Veterans Legacy Grants Program (VLGP). VA would establish grant application procedures and evaluative criteria for determining whether to issue funding to eligible entities to conduct cemetery research and produce VLGP educational materials. Educational materials would relate the histories of Veterans interred in national, State, or Tribal Veterans' cemeteries and would promote community engagement with those histories.
