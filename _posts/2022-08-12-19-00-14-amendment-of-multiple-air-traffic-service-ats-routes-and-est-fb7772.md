## Summary

This action corrects a final rule published by the FAA in the Federal Register on June 30, 2022, that amends Jet Routes J-19, J-20, J-52, J-98, J-134, and J-231, RNAV route Q-176, and VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-210, V-234, V-350, and V-507; and establishes RNAV routes T-418 and T-431. The final rule identified the KENTO, NM, route point as a waypoint (WP), in error. This action makes editorial corrections to all references of the KENTO, NM, waypoint (WP) to change them to the KENTO, NM, Fix to match the FAA's aeronautical database information.
