## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER series airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of missing shims, a wrong type of shim, shanked fasteners, fastener head gaps, and incorrect hole sizes common to the left and right sides at a certain station (STA) frame inner chord and web. This AD requires inspecting for existing repairs, inspecting the area for cracking, and performing applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
