## Summary

Notice is hereby given that the Bureau of the Census (Census Bureau) is considering a proposal to conduct the Annual Integrated Economic Survey (AIES). The AIES is a new survey designed to integrate and replace seven existing annual business surveys into one survey and will provide the only comprehensive national and subnational data on business revenues, expenses, and assets on an annual basis. The AIES is designed to combine Census Bureau collections to reduce respondent burden, increase data quality, and allow the Census Bureau to operate more efficiently to reduce costs. These data are not publicly available from nongovernment or other governmental sources. Based on information and recommendations received by the Census Bureau, the data have significant application to the needs of other government agencies and the public.
