## Summary

Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ) within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) invites the general public and other Federal agencies to comment on a proposed information collection. SAMHSA plans to collect information from the public to fulfill its data security requirements when providing access to restricted use microdata for the purpose of evidence building. SAMHSA's data security agreements and other paperwork along with the corresponding security protocols allow SAMHSA to maintain careful controls on confidentiality and privacy, as required by law. The purpose of this notice is to allow for 60 days of public comment on the proposed data security information collection, prior to submission of the information collection request (ICR) to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
