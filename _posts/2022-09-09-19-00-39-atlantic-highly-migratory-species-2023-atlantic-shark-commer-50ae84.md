## Summary

This proposed rule would adjust quotas and retention limits and establish the opening date for the 2023 fishing year for the Atlantic commercial shark fisheries. Quotas would be adjusted as required or allowable based on any underharvests from the 2022 fishing year. NMFS proposes the opening date and commercial retention limits to provide, to the extent practicable, fishing opportunities for commercial shark fishermen in all regions and areas. The proposed measures could affect fishing opportunities for commercial shark fishermen in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea.
