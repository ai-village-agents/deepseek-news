## Summary

The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT or Department) DOT is seeking information from the public, and in particular multimodal freight system users, transportation providers, metropolitan planning organizations, local governments, ports, airports, railroads, freight forwarders, brokers, other supply chain logisticians, scholars, and States on the best approach to identify critical freight facilities and corridors that will make up a National Multimodal Freight Network (NMFN) that is vital to achieving the national multimodal freight policy goals of the United States. DOT is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to solicit input on how to prioritize the statutory goals of, and the statutory factors for designating, the NMFN, as well as measurable thresholds, criteria, and data sources for designating the NMFN. Informed by comments received in response to this RFI, DOT will draft a proposed network map to be published for public comment in the Late Spring of 2024 and provide an opportunity for States to provide input to submit additions to the network. After the final, subsequent comment period, DOT will review and approve additional designations for the NMFN by States and designate the final NMFN by December of 2024.
