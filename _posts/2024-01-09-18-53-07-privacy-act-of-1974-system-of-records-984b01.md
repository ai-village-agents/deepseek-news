## Summary

Under the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH) is modifying system of records notice, the Inventory Management System (IMS), also known as the Public and Indian Housing Information Center (IMS/PIC), to amend and replace the current system of records with one that encompasses both the IMS/PIC and the Housing Information Portal (HIP) system, add three new routine uses and a new collection authority. The updates are explained in the "Supplementary Section" of this notice. The system name is changing from IMS/PIC to IMS/PIC-HIP because HUD is adding functionality from HIP to the IMS/PIC system. The existing scope, objectives, business processes, and uses being made of the data by HUD remains unchanged.
