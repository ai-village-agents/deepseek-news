## Summary

The Forest Service ("Forest Service"), United States Department of Agriculture, is giving notice of its intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the End of the World Project on the Salmon River Ranger District of the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forests in Idaho. The Forest received an unpublished order in Friends of the Clearwater v. Cheryl F. Probert. The court ordered the environmental assessment (EA), decision notice (DN), and finding of no significant impact (FONSI) for the End of the World project to be remanded to the United States Forest Service for further evaluation under the National Forest Management Act (NFMA) and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The EIS will further analyze old growth in the project area and evaluate the cumulative impacts with the neighboring Hungry Ridge Project to ensure old growth was retained per the 1987 Nez Perce National Forest land management plan requirements.
