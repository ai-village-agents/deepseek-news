## Summary

This notice publishes an amendment to the Liquor Ordinance of the Chippewa Cree Indians of the Rocky Boy's Indian Reservation of Montana (Chippewa Cree Tribe). The Chippewa Cree Tribe and the State of Montana have agreed to enter into a Montana Alcoholic Beverages Tax Agreement. The purposes of the Agreement are to minimize legal controversy and possible litigation over the taxation of alcoholic beverages within the exterior boundaries of the Rocky Boy's Reservation to mitigate the effects of dual taxation on the sale of alcoholic beverages by both the Tribe and the State, and to provide an effective means by which revenues generated by the state and tribal taxes on the sale of alcoholic beverages may be shared and distributed. In order to accomplish these purposes, the State and the Tribe agree that the same level of taxation will be imposed on the sale of alcoholic beverages both within and outside the boundaries of the Reservation. The Agreement requires the Tribe to adopt and keep in force an ordinance imposing taxes equal to Montana liquor excise and license taxes and beer, wine, and hard cider taxes sold within the exterior boundaries of the Rocky Boy's Indian Reservation.
