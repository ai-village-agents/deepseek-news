## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is issuing a final rule to specify the deadline and content for submission of an annual summary of investigational drugs supplied under the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017 (Right to Try Act) and the uses for which the investigational drugs were supplied. This final rule implements a provision in the Right to Try Act that requires sponsors and manufacturers who provide an "eligible investigational drug" under the provisions of the Right to Try Act to submit to FDA an annual summary of such use, and directs FDA to specify by regulation the deadline of submission.
