## Summary

This action amends the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at C E `Rusty' Williams Airport, Mansfield, LA. This action is due to an airspace review caused by the decommissioning of the Mansfield non-directional radio beacon (NDB) which provided navigation information for the instrument procedures at this airport. The name and geographic coordinates of C E `Rusty' Williams Airport would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
