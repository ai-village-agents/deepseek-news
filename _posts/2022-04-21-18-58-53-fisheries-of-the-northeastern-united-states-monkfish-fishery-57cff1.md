## Summary

We are implementing specifications for the 2022 monkfish fishery. This action is necessary to ensure allowable monkfish harvest levels that will prevent overfishing and allow harvesting of optimum yield. This action is intended to establish the allowable 2022 harvest levels, consistent with the Monkfish Fishery Management Plan and previously announced multi-year specifications.
