## Summary

MARAD invites public comments on its intention to request approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to renew an information collection in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The proposed collection OMB 2133-0553 (Mariner Cadet Training- Agreements, Compliance Reporting, and Audits) is being updated to remove references to collection instrument placeholders that will no longer be implemented. Consequently, there is a decrease in the total public burden for this collection. MARAD is required to publish this notice in the Federal Register to obtain comments from the public and affected agencies.
