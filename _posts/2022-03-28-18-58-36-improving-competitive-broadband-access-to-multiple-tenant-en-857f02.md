## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission or FCC) adopts final rules to improve competition for communications services in multi-tenant environments. The rules prohibit telecommunications carriers and covered multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs) from entering into certain revenue sharing agreements with a building owner that keep competitive providers out of buildings. The rules also require providers to inform tenants about the existence of exclusive marketing arrangements in simple, easy-to-understand language that is readily accessible. The Commission adopted the Report and Order in conjunction with a Declaratory Ruling in GN Docket No. 17-142 in which the Commission clarifies that existing Commission rules regarding cable inside wiring prohibit so-called sale-and-leaseback arrangements that block competitive access to alternative providers.
