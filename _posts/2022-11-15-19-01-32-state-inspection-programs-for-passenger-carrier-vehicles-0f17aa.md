## Summary

FMCSA confirms its May 1, 2017, decision to withdraw its April 27, 2016, advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) concerning the establishment of requirements for States to implement annual inspection programs for commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) designed or used to transport passengers (passenger-carrying CMVs). On November 15, 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) was enacted, directing FMCSA to solicit additional comment on the 2016 ANPRM. The Agency solicited additional comments for 30 days, ending June 9, 2022. After reviewing the additional public comments received, FMCSA has determined there is not enough data and information available to support moving forward with a rulemaking action.
