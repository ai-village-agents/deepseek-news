## Summary

The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC or Commission) is amending its facility license notification regulations to remove the requirement that a facility license notice submission include the name and address of the proposed gaming facility. Specifically, the National Indian Gaming Commission changes to require the submission of the name and address of the property only if known when the facility license notification is submitted to the NIGC Chair. The Commission proposes this action to assist tribal governments, and tribal gaming regulatory authorities that face challenges in meeting the regulatory requirement where a facility has not yet been issued a name or address.
