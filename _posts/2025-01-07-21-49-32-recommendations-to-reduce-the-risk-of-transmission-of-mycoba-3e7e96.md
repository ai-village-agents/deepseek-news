## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, Agency, or we) is announcing the availability of a final guidance for immediate implementation entitled "Recommendations To Reduce the Risk of Transmission of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (Mtb) by Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products (HCT/Ps)." FDA is issuing this guidance to assist establishments that make donor eligibility determinations for donors of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps), with recommendations for screening donors for evidence of, and risk factors for, infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the organism that causes tuberculosis. The guidance also recommends additional steps that HCT/P establishments should take to reduce risk of transmission of Mtb until such time as appropriate FDA-licensed, approved, or cleared donor screening tests are available for use to test donors for Mtb infection. The guidance identifies Mtb as a relevant communicable disease agent or disease (RCDAD) and supplements the recommendations contained in other donor eligibility guidance documents for donors of HCT/Ps. This guidance is being issued to address the urgent public health need to reduce the risk of transmission of Mtb by HCT/Ps.
