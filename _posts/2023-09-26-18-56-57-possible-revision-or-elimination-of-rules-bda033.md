## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communication Commission (FCC or Commission) invites the general public to comment on the Commission's rules to be reviewed pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended. The purpose of the review is to determine whether Commission rules that the FCC adopted in calendar years 2007-2012 should be continued without change, amended, or rescinded in order to minimize any significant impact the rule(s) may have on a substantial number of small entities. Upon receiving comments from the public, the Commission will evaluate those comments and consider whether action should be taken to rescind or amend the relevant rule(s), or retain the rule(s) without modification.
