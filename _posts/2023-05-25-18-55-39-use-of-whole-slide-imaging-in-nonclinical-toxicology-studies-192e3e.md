## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled "Use of Whole Slide Imaging in Nonclinical Toxicology Studies: Questions and Answers." This guidance represents FDA's current thinking on the use of whole slide images during good laboratory practice (GLP)-compliant toxicology studies. Documentation practices during generation, use, and retention of whole slide images have not been clearly defined and vary among nonclinical testing facilities. This question-and-answer document is intended to clarify FDA's recommendations concerning the management, documentation, and use of whole slide images in histopathology assessment and/or pathology peer review for nonclinical studies conducted in compliance with the GLP regulations. This guidance finalizes the draft guidance of the same title issued on April 8, 2022.
