## Summary

The FAA is correcting an airworthiness directive (AD) that was published in the Federal Register. That AD applies to certain BAE Systems (Operations) Limited Model BAe 146 and Model Avro 146-RJ series airplanes. As published, the identity of certain airplanes in the preamble and regulatory text, and one paragraph reference in the regulatory text, are incorrect. This document corrects those errors. In all other respects, the original document remains the same.
