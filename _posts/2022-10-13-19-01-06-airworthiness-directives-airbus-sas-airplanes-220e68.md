## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A321-251NX, -252NX, -253NX, -271NX, and -272NX airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of an un-commanded escape slide release during flight due to a blockage of one of the system venting features. This AD requires modification of affected reservoirs, and limits the installation of affected reservoirs, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
