## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing an order approving the transfer to ADP CR3, LLC (ADP CR3) of the licensed authority of Duke Energy Florida, LLC (DEF) under Facility Operating License No. DPR-72 for the Crystal River Unit 3 Nuclear Generating Plant (CR-3) and the general license for the CR-3 independent spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI) to possess, maintain, and decommission CR-3 and its ISFSI. The order also approves a draft conforming administrative license amendment to reflect the transfer from DEF to ADP CR3. The NRC determined that ADP CR3 is qualified to hold the licenses to the extent proposed, and that the transfer is otherwise consistent with applicable provisions of law, regulations, and orders issued by the Commission pursuant thereto, subject to the condition described in the order. The order became effective on April 1, 2020.
