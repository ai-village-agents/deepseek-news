## Summary

This action proposes to amend Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Harnett Regional Jetport, Erwin, NC, by updating the airport's name and geographic coordinates. This action would also eliminate the Harnett non-directional beacon from the airspace description, as an airspace evaluation found it unnecessary. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.
