## Summary

This document amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regulations to reflect an extension of import restrictions on certain categories of archaeological artifacts and ethnological material of the Republic of Peru. The restrictions, which were originally imposed by Treasury Decision (T.D.) 97-50 and last extended by CBP Decision (CBP Dec.) 17-03, are due to expire on June 9, 2022, unless extended. The Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States Department of State, has made the requisite determinations for extending the import restrictions that previously existed and no cause for suspension exists. Pursuant to the exchange of diplomatic notes to extend the agreement, the import restrictions will remain in effect for an additional five years, and the CBP regulations are being amended to reflect this further extension through June 8, 2027. CBP-Dec. 17-03 contains the Designated List of archeological artifacts and ethnological material from Peru to which the restrictions apply.
