## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) proposes further examination of whether television broadcasters, radio broadcasters, and satellite providers should be subject to mandatory reporting in the FCC's Disaster Information Reporting System (DIRS). Additionally, this document proposes requirements for the First Responder Network (FirstNet) to report in the Commission's Network Outage Reporting System (NORS) and in DIRS. This document also proposes to require mobile and fixed Broadband internet access service (BIAS) providers to submit reports of outages to the FCC's NORS and DIRS. The document also proposes requiring current and future service providers to supply the Commission with information concerning the location of their mobile recovery assets, including the location of their Cells on Wheels (COWs) and Cells on Light Trucks (COLTs). This document also proposes requiring providers that report in DIRS to provide "after action" reports at the Commission's direction. These requirements would further protect the nation's communications systems from cybersecurity threats. With this Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (SFNPRM), the Commission seeks comment on the proposed rules and any suitable alternatives.
