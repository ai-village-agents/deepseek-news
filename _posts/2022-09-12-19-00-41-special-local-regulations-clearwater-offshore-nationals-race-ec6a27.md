Approximately 50 powerboats traveling at speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour are expected to participate. Additionally, it is anticipated that 500 spectator vessels will be present along the race course.

The special local regulation will establish an enforcement area where all persons and vessels, except those persons and vessels participating in the high-speed boat races, are prohibited from entering, transiting through, anchoring in, or remaining within the regulated area without obtaining permission from the Captain of the Port St. Petersburg or a designated representative.
