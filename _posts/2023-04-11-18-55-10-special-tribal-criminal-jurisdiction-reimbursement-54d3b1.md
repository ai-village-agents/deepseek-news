## Summary

The Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 2022 (VAWA 2022) authorized a new program to reimburse Tribal governments (or authorized designees of Tribal governments) for expenses incurred in exercising "special Tribal criminal jurisdiction" (STCJ) over non- Indians who commit certain covered crimes in Indian country. This rule will implement this new Tribal Reimbursement Program within the Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) by providing details on how it will be administered, including eligibility, frequency of reimbursement, costs that can be reimbursed, the annual maximum allowable reimbursement per Tribe, and conditions for waiver of the annual maximum.
