## Summary

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) invites public comment on one currently approved Information Collection Request (ICR), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number 1652-0073, that we will submit to OMB for an extension in compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected burden. The collection of information involves an application completed by public and private entities requesting participation in TSA's Reimbursable Screening Services Program (RSSP), currently a pilot program for up to eight locations to obtain TSA security screening services outside of an existing primary passenger airport terminal screening area where screening services are currently provided or would be eligible to be provided under TSA's annually appropriated passenger screening program.
