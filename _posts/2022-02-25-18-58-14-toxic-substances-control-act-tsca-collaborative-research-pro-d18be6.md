## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is holding a virtual public meeting to seek individual input on the proposed Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) New Chemicals Collaborative Research Program. This virtual meeting will be held over 2 half days. In addition, EPA is announcing the availability of and soliciting public comment on the draft document entitled "Modernizing the Process and Bringing Innovative Science to Evaluate New Chemicals Under TSCA." The Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (OCSPP) is proposing to develop and implement a multi-year collaborative research program focused on approaches for performing risk assessments on new chemical substances under TSCA. This effort will be performed in partnership with the Agency's Office of Research and Development (ORD) and other federal entities to leverage their expertise and resources. The results of the effort are expected to bring innovative science to new chemical reviews, modernize the approaches used, and increase the transparency of the information underpinning the human health and ecological risk assessment process.
