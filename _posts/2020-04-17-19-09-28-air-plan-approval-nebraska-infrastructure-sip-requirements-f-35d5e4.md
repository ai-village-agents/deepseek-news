## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve elements of a State Implementation Plan (SIP) submission from the State of Nebraska addressing the applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA) section 110 for the 2015 Ozone (O<INF>3</INF>) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Whenever the EPA promulgates a new or revised NAAQS, CAA section 110 requires that each State adopt and submit a SIP submission to establish that the State's SIP meets infrastructure requirements for the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of each such new or revised NAAQS. These SIP submissions are commonly referred to as "infrastructure" SIPs. The infrastructure requirements are designed to ensure that the structural components of each State's air quality management program are adequate to meet the State's responsibilities under the CAA.
