## Summary

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO or Office) seeks public comments on a proposed Track Three Pilot Program that would permit micro entity applicants to delay payment of the search fee and the examination fee for a period of 30 months from the earliest filing date claimed, under certain conditions. By lowering a barrier to intellectual property protection, the proposed Track Three Pilot Program reinforces the USPTO's commitment to providing the best and most accessible intellectual property system in the world. Under the proposed Track Three Pilot Program, micro entity applicants would need to submit a request to participate in the program when filing a nonprovisional utility or plant application, pay the basic filing fee, and satisfy other requirements, including the requirement that the application be in condition for publication to enable it to be published after the expiration of 18 months from the earliest filing date for which a benefit is sought. The USPTO is also exploring including in the Track Three Pilot Program an option that would permit micro entity applicants, under certain conditions, to obtain a pre- examination search report prior to the deadline for payment of the examination fee. The pre-examination search report would provide applicants with additional information as they consider potential commercialization and the value of their invention.
