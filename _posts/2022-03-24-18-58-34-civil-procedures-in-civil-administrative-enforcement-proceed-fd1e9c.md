## Summary

NOAA proposes to amend procedures governing its civil administrative enforcement proceedings. The principal changes would include updates to statutory references, clarifications regarding the Administrator's discretionary review, revised directions for appealing a written warning, revised requirements for denying a request for admission, and revised directions for electronic service related to certain appeals and petitions. Other changes would remove the requirement for NOAA to challenge late hearing requests, simplify the use of electronic signatures, rename discovery filings, allow depositions by videoconference, require discovery filings to state when a witness is expected to speak in a language other than the English language in order to arrange interpretation, clarify when failing to pay can be a basis for permit sanctions, incorporate Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act deadlines into administrative forfeiture proceedings, and allow NOAA to publish a Notice of Proposed Forfeiture on an official government website. In addition, minor changes would update titles and addresses and correct clerical errors.
