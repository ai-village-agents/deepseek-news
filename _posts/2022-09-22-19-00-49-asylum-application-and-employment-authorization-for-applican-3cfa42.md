## Summary

This final rule removes changes to regulatory text resulting from two final rules issued in June 2020, which were vacated by a Federal district court in February 2022. This final rule implements the vacatur by removing certain regulatory text governing asylum applications, interviews, and eligibility for employment authorization and an employment authorization document (EAD) based on a pending asylum application. It also reinserts various regulatory provisions as they appeared prior to the effective dates of the two final rules issued in June 2020.
