## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), have received an incidental take permit (ITP) application from the Port Blakely Company, including a habitat conservation plan (HCP) for the John Franklin Eddy Forestlands in Clackamas County, Oregon. Port Blakely submitted the ITP application and HCP pursuant to the Endangered Species Act. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) also received an ITP application from Port Blakely and, concurrent with this notice, has also published a notice of availability for comment on the ITP application, the applicant's HCP, and, as the lead Federal agency under the National Environmental Policy Act, a draft environmental assessment (draft EA) analyzing the potential effects of issuance of the respective ITPs. We invite the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies to comment on these documents.
