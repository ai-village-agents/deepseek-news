## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") is reopening the comment period for its proposal, Modernization of Beneficial Ownership Reporting, Release No. 33-11030, (Feb. 10, 2022) ("Proposing Release"). In the Proposing Release, the Commission proposed to amend certain rules that govern beneficial ownership reporting ("Proposed Amendments"). The Proposed Amendments would modernize the filing deadlines for initial and amended beneficial ownership reports filed on Schedules 13D and 13G. The Proposed Amendments also would deem holders of certain cash-settled derivative securities as beneficial owners of the reference equity securities and clarify the disclosure requirements of Schedule 13D with respect to derivative securities. In addition, the Proposed Amendments would clarify and affirm the operation of the beneficial ownership reporting rules as applied to two or more persons that form a group under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and provide new exemptions to permit such persons to communicate and consult with each other, jointly engage issuers, and execute certain transactions without being subject to regulation as a group. Finally, the Proposed Amendments would require that Schedules 13D and 13G be filed using a structured, machine- readable data language. The Commission is reopening the comment period to allow interested persons an opportunity to comment on the additional analysis and data contained in a staff memorandum that was added to the public comment file on April 28, 2023.
