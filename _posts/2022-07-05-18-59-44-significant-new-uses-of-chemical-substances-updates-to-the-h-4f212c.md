## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is amending the regulations governing significant new uses of chemical substances under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to align with revisions that were made to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Hazard Communications Standard (HCS) and changes to the OSHA Respiratory Protection Standard and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) respirator certification requirements for the respiratory protection of workers from exposure to chemicals. In addition, EPA is amending the regulations governing Significant New Use Rules (SNURs) to address issues that have been identified by EPA and raised by stakeholders through public comments. EPA is also making a minor change to reporting requirements for premanufacture notices (PMNs) and other TSCA notifications. EPA expects these changes to have minimal impact on the costs and burdens of compliance, while updating the significant new use reporting requirements to assist in addressing any potential risks to human health and the environment.
