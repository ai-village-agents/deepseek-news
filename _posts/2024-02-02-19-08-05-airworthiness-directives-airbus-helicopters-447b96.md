# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model SA-365N, SA-365N1, AS-365N2, and AS 365 N3 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of an obstructed tail rotor (TR) pedal control that was blocked during flight. This proposed AD would require a one-time inspection for proper positioning of the TR actuator harness and cable ties installation and, depending on the results, accomplishing corrective action, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
