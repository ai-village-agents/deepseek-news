## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-2B19 (Regional Jet Series 100 & 440), CL-600-2C10 (Regional Jet Series 700, 701 & 702), CL-600-2C11 (Regional Jet Series 550), CL-600-2D15 (Regional Jet Series 705), CL- 600-2D24 (Regional Jet Series 900), and CL-600-2E25 (Regional Jet Series 1000) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that certain airplanes have outdated magnetic variation (MV) tables inside navigation systems. This proposed AD would require revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to update the Flight Management System (FMS), Inertial Reference System (IRS), and Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) limitations. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
