## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) debarring Kris A. Hampton-Bey II for a period of 5 years from importing or offering for import any drug into the United States. FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Hampton-Bey II engaged in a pattern of importing or offering for import misbranded drugs (i.e. in an amount, frequency, or dosage that is inconsistent with his personal or household use) that are not designated in an authorized electronic data interchange system as products regulated by FDA. Mr. Hampton-Bey II was given notice of the proposed debarment and was given an opportunity to request a hearing to show why he should not be debarred. As of May 8, 2022 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Mr. Hampton-Bey II had not responded. Mr. Hampton-Bey II's failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this matter.
