## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is proposing to remove from the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) four regulations in the Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned (SDVO) Small Business Concern (SBC) Program that are no longer necessary because they are unnecessary or redundant. The removal of these regulations will assist the public by simplifying SBA's regulations in the CFR.
