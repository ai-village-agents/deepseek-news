## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) proposes to amend and reissue a current system of records notice, titled FMCS-0006, Ethics Records. The system will cover the Executive Branch Confidential Financial Disclosure Reports, and agency ethics guidance to employees and FMCS clients. The notice amendment includes significant updates to refine details published under the system manager, authority for maintenance of the system, the purpose, categories of individuals covered, categories of records, record source categories, routine uses, record access procedures, contesting records, and history. These sections are amended to refine previously published information about the system of records. The addresses, system name and number, security classification, system location, policies and practices for storage, policies and practices for retrieval, policies and practices for retention, administrative safeguards, notification procedures, and exemptions remain unchanged. This amended SORN deletes and supersedes the SORN published on the Federal Register on October 27, 2021.
