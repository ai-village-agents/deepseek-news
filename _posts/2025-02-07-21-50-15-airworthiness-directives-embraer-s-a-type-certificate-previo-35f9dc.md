## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-12-12, which applies to all Embraer S.A. Model ERJ 170 airplanes and Model ERJ 190-100 STD, -100 LR, -100 ECJ, -100 IGW, -200 STD, -200 LR, and -200 IGW airplanes. AD 2020-12-12 requires repetitive detailed inspections for cracking of the engine inboard and outboard engine pylon lower link lugs, and repair if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-12-12, it was determined that certain compliance times must be reduced. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2020-12-12, with revised compliance times, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
