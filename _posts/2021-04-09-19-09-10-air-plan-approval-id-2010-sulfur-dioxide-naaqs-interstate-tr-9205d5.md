## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) submission from the State of Idaho (Idaho or the State) that addresses the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) interstate transport requirements for the 2010 1-hour Sulfur Dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). In this action, EPA is determining that Idaho will not contribute significantly to nonattainment or interfere with maintenance of the 2010 1-hour SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS in any other state, the Fort Hall Reservation, or the Kalispel Reservation. Therefore, EPA is approving Idaho's December 24, 2015 SIP submission as meeting the interstate transport requirements for the 2010 1-hour SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS.
