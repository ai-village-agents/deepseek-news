## Summary

Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-108, notice is hereby given that the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), a component within the United States Department of Justice (DOJ or Department), proposes to develop a new system of records titled "Pro Bono List Program Records," and numbered JUSTICE/EOIR-005. EOIR proposes to establish this system of records to track and manage information and documents related to the List of Pro Bono Legal Service Providers (the List), as well as administration of the underlying application process for organizations, pro bono referral services, and attorneys to be included on the List. The system integrates an electronic information system to manage the records more efficiently, simplify the application process for providers through an online web- based Pro Bono List User Portal, allow providers to update their own contact information in the List, and streamline communications between EOIR, legal service providers, and the public.
