## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2016-20- 12, AD 2018-17-21, and AD 2019-14-04, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A318, A319, A320, and A321 series airplanes. AD 2019-14-04 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations and terminated the provisions of AD 2018-17-21, which, in turn, terminated the provisions of AD 2016-20-12. This AD was prompted by the determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
