## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for a new information collection. The collection involves the use of a questionnaire to assess the guidance, training, and technology used to prevent accidents among ramp workers. The information to be collected is necessary to support the implementation of section 353 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 (Pub. L. 118-63).
