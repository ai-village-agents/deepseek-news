## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Mission Support is giving notice that it proposes to create a new system of records pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. The Data Management and Analytics Platform (DMAP) is an existing analytical tool that EPA uses to store data and to create data maps, pie charts, and run statistics. EPA intends to expand DMAP to include personally identifiable information already collected by the EPA from databases recording drinking water intake locations; EPA property databases; and EPA personnel information databases.
