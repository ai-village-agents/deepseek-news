## Summary

This action extends the comment period for the notice of proposed rulemaking, (NPRM), Public Aircraft Logging of Flight Time, Training in Certain Aircraft Holding Special Airworthiness Certificates, and Flight Instructor Privileges. On June 23, 2023, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published this proposed rule. The NPRM proposed to allow pilots conducting public aircraft operations (PAO) to credit their flight time towards FAA civil regulatory requirements. Additionally, the FAA proposed to amend the operating rules for experimental aircraft to permit certain flight training, testing, and checking in these aircraft without a letter of deviation authority (LODA). The FAA proposed to extend the same relief to certain flight training, testing, and checking in limited category, primary category, and experimental light sport aircraft. The FAA also proposed miscellaneous amendments related to recent flight experience, flight instructor privileges, flight training in certain aircraft holding special airworthiness certificates, and the related prohibitions on conducting these activities for compensation or hire. The FAA is extending the comment period for this NPRM to allow commenters additional time to analyze the proposed rule and prepare a response.
