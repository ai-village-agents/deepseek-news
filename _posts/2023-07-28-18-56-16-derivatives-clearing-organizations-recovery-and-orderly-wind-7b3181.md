## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission or CFTC) is proposing amendments to certain regulations applicable to systemically important derivatives clearing organizations (SIDCOs) and derivatives clearing organizations (DCOs) that elect to be subject to the provisions in the Commission's regulations (Subpart C DCOs). These proposed amendments would, among other things, address certain risk management obligations, modify definitions, and codify existing staff guidance. The Commission is also proposing to amend certain regulations to require DCOs that are not designated as systemically important, and which have not elected to be covered by our regulations, to submit orderly Wind-Down plans. In addition, the Commission is proposing to make conforming amendments to certain provisions, revise the Subpart C Election Form and Form DCO, and remove stale provisions.
