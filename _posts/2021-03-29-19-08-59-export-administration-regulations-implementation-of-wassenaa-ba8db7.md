## Summary

The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) maintains, as part of its Export Administration Regulations (EAR), the Commerce Control List (CCL), which identifies certain items subject to Department of Commerce jurisdiction. This final rule revises the CCL, as well as corresponding parts of the EAR, to implement changes to the Wassenaar Arrangement List of Dual-Use Goods and Technologies (WA List) that were decided upon by governments participating in the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies (Wassenaar Arrangement, or WA) at the December 2019 WA Plenary meeting. The Wassenaar Arrangement advocates implementation of effective export controls on strategic items with the objective of improving regional and international security and stability. This rule harmonizes the CCL with the decisions reached at the 2019 Plenary meeting by revising Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs) controlled for national security reasons in each category of the CCL. This rule also makes associated changes to the EAR as well as corrections. This rule also makes changes to various provisions related to Category 5--Part 2 of the CCL in the EAR, including provisions on License Exception Encryption commodities, software, and technology (ENC). These changes, which include the elimination of reporting requirements for certain encryption items, are designed to reduce the regulatory burden for exporters while still fulfilling U.S. national security and foreign policy objectives.
