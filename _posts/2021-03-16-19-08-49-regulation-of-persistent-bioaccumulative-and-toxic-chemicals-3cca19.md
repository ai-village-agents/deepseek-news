## Summary

In accordance with the January 21, 2021, Executive Order entitled "Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis" and other Biden-Harris Administration Executive orders and other direction, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is requesting additional public comments on five final rules recently issued under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). On January 6, 2021, EPA issued final rules to address its obligations under TSCA for five persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT) chemicals that EPA determined met the criteria for expedited action under TSCA. These chemicals are 2,4,6-tris(tert-butyl)phenol (2,4,6-TTBP) (CASRN 732-26-3); decabromodiphenyl ether (decaBDE) (CASRN 1163-19-5); phenol, isopropylated phosphate (3:1) (PIP (3:1)) (CASRN 68937-41-7); pentachlorothiophenol (PCTP) (CASRN 133-49-3); and hexachlorobutadiene (HCBD) (CASRN 87-68-3). PBT chemicals are of particular concern in the Agency's efforts to protect human health and the environment because they are toxic and remain in the environment for long periods of time and can build up or accumulate in the body. As a first step in its efforts to immediately review these rules to determine whether they are consistent with the Administration policy to limit exposure to dangerous chemicals (and to determine whether and how these rules should be revised), EPA invites public comment on the final rules, including whether there are further exposure reductions that could be achieved, including exposure reductions for potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations and the environment; implementation issues associated with these final rules; and whether to consider additional or alternative measures or approaches. In particular, EPA is seeking comment on specifics of recently raised issues regarding the compliance date for the prohibition on the processing and distribution of PIP (3:1) for use in articles, and PIP (3:1)-containing articles.
