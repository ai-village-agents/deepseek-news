## Summary

We, NMFS, announce receipt of a permit application (26277) to enhance the propagation and survival of species listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973, as amended, from the United States Corps of Engineers (USACE) and California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW). The USACE and CDFW are requesting for the next 10 years, hatchery and monitoring activities associated with the Russian River Steelhead Program (RRSP). As part of this permit application, the USACE and CDFW have submitted an HGMP as an attachment to the application. This notice advises the public that the permit application and associated HGMP are available for review and comment, prior to a determination by NMFS on the issuance of the permit. This document serves to notify the public of the availability of the HGMP and associated draft EA that analyzes two alternatives for comment, prior to a decision by NMFS whether to approve the proposed hatchery program. The permit application, and attached HGMP, may be viewed online at: https://apps.nmfs.noaa.gov/preview/preview_open_for_comment.cfm.
