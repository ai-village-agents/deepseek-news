## Summary

In response to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) Memorandum and Order, CLI-22-03 (February 24, 2022), the NRC received Subsequent License Renewal--Appendix E Environmental Report Supplement 2 (ER Supplement), dated November 7, 2022, related to the subsequent renewal of Renewed Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-38, DPR-47, and DPR-55, which authorizes Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (Duke Energy, the applicant) to operate Oconee Nuclear Station (Oconee), Units 1, 2, and 3. The ER Supplement addresses certain environmental impacts of operating Oconee for an additional period of 20 years beyond the current license expiration dates. The NRC will conduct a limited scoping process to gather additional information necessary to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) to evaluate the environmental impacts for the subsequent license renewal (SLR) of the operating licenses for Oconee. The NRC is seeking public comment on the proper scope of the EIS to be prepared for this action.
