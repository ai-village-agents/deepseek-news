## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary special local regulation in the navigable waters of San Francisco Bay in San Francisco, CA in support of the San Francisco Sail Grand Prix 2020 official practice and race periods between April 30, 2020 and May 3, 2020. This special local regulation is necessary to ensure the safety of mariners transiting the area from the dangers of high-speed sailing activities associated with the Sail Grand Prix 2020 race event. This proposed temporary special local regulation will temporarily restrict vessel traffic adjacent to the city of San Francisco waterfront in the vicinity of the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz Island and prohibit vessels and persons not participating in the race event from entering the dedicated race and practice areas. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
