## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the DoD is modifying and reissuing a current system of records titled, "DoD Media Pool and Pentagon Correspondent Files," DPAD 12.0. This system of records was originally established by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Public Affairs) to collect and maintain records on news media representatives nominated by their respective bureaus to be members of the DoD Media Pool and Pentagon correspondents who may conduct interviews with Pentagon executive-level personnel. This system of records notice (SORN) is being updated to incorporate the DoD standard routine uses and support additional information sharing of these records outside of the DoD. The routine uses are proposed to be updated to allow for disclosure to the Department of State to issue passports/visas to these individuals, and to foreign embassies to obtain a foreign entry visa for these individuals. The DoD is also modifying various other sections within the SORN to improve clarity or update information that has changed.
