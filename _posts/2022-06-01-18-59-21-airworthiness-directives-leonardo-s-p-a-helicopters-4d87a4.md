## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Leonardo S.p.a. Model A109S and AW109SP helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of a protective sheath, installed around a fixed flight control rod, which should have been removed during assembly. This AD requires borescope inspecting certain parts, and removing any foreign object if detected, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
