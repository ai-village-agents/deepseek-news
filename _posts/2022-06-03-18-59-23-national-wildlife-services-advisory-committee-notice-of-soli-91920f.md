## Summary

Through this notice, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is soliciting a call for nominations for membership to fill up to 20 vacancies for the National Wildlife Services Advisory Committee (NWSAC). The full committee consists of 20 members; each person selected is expected to serve a 2-year term. Membership will be composed of persons representing a broad spectrum of agricultural, environmental, conservation, academic, animal welfare, and related interests. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service expects the Secretary of Agriculture to appoint new Committee members for the entire committee in 2022.

Members can only serve on one USDA advisory committee at a time. All nominees will undergo a USDA background check. You must submit the following to nominate yourself or someone else to the NWSAC: A resume (required), a USDA Advisory Committee Membership Background Information Form AD-755, which is available online at https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ ad-755.pdf (required), a cover letter (required), and a list of endorsements or letters of recommendation (optional).
