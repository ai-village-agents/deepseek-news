## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to modify the operating schedule that governs the West 79th Street Bridge crossing the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway (AICW), mile 1084.6 at Miami, Florida and the operating schedule that governs the East 79th Street Bridge crossing Miami Beach Channel, mile 2.20 at Miami Beach, FL. This action will place the East and West 79th Street Bridges crossing Miami Beach Channel and Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, Miami, FL on a once an hour opening schedule during peak traffic hours, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. This action is intended to reduce vehicular traffic caused by these bridges opening at their current schedule. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
