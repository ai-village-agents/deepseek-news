## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for certain waters of Sturgeon Bay, WI. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters during the boat parade for the Graduates of Sturgeon Bay High School on May 29, 2021. This proposed rulemaking would restrict usage by persons and vessels within the safety zone. At no time during the effective period may non-parade vessels transit the waters of Sturgeon Bay between the Highway 42 Bridge and Michigan Street Bridge. These restrictions would apply to all vessels during the effective period unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Lake Michigan or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
