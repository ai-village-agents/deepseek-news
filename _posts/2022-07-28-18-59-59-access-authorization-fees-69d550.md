## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations to update the access authorization fees charged to NRC licensees for work performed under the Material Access Authorization Program and the Information Access Authority Program. The change in fees is due to an increase in the review time for each application for access authorization. This final rule is prompted by a recent audit of fees performed by an external certified public accounting and financial management services firm and ensures that the NRC continues to recover the full costs of processing access authorization requests from NRC licensees. The final rule also makes two administrative changes to revise definitions to include new naming conventions for background investigation case types and to specify the electronic process for completing security forms.
