## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency is proposing changes to regulations promulgated under the Technology Transitions section of the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act of 2020, which authorizes the Administrator to restrict the use of particular hydrofluorocarbons in the sectors and subsectors in which they are used. This proposal addresses administrative petitions and other requests from companies and trade associations across a number of subsectors, including refrigerated transport--intermodal containers, industrial process refrigeration and chillers for industrial process refrigeration used in semiconductor manufacturing, retail food refrigeration systems for remote condensing units and supermarkets, cold storage warehouses, refrigerated laboratory centrifuges, laboratory shakers, and condensing units in residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pumps. This action proposes to allow previously manufactured and imported residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump equipment to continue to be installed. The Agency is also seeking advance comment on potential actions to address supply chain issues for a refrigerant blend.
