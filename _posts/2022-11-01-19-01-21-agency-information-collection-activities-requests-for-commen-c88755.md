## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on May 13, 2022. The collection involves the voluntary submission of responses to survey questions. The information is collected from holders of FAA production approvals and selected suppliers and provides them an opportunity to offer their input on how well the agency is performing the administration and conduct of the Aircraft Certification Systems Quality System Audit (QSA). The information to be collected will be used to promote continuous improvement initiatives and industry dialog in the FAA oversight process.
