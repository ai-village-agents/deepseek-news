## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-09-13, which applies to certain ATR--GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42-500 airplanes. AD 2021-09-13 requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-09-13, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would revise the applicability by adding airplanes. This proposed AD would also continue to require the actions in AD 2021-09-13 and require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
