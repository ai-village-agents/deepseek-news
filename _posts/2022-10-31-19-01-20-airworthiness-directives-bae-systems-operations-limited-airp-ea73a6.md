# Airworthiness Directives; BAE Systems (Operations) Limited Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 99- 25-11, which applies to certain BAE Systems (Operations) Limited Model BAe 146 and Avro 146-RJ series airplanes. AD 99-25-11 requires repetitive inspections for cracks along the face of the retraction attachment boss in the nose landing gear (NLG) sidewall; and corrective action, if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 99-25-11, additional cracking was found that indicated additional airplanes are subject to the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 99-25-11, and expand the applicability. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
