## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for navigable waters within a 500-yard radius of the USS New Jersey during active dead ship tow operations. The USS New Jersey will be transiting from berth in Camden, NJ, to Paulsboro, NJ, and then over to the Navy Yard in Philadelphia, PA. The safety zone, which will only be enforced during active towing operations, is needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards created by the dead ship tow. Entry of vessels or persons into this zone is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port, Sector Delaware Bay.
