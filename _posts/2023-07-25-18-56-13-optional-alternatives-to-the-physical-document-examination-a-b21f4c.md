## Summary

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is amending its regulations to create a framework under which the Secretary of Homeland Security (the Secretary) may, as an optional alternative to the in- person physical document examination method that employers have followed as part of the Form I-9 process set forth in current regulations, authorize alternative document examination procedures. The Secretary may authorize such alternative procedures with respect to some or all employers as part of a pilot program, upon the Secretary's determination that such procedures offer an equivalent level of security, or as a temporary measure to address a public health emergency declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services pursuant to section 319 of the Public Health Service Act, or a national emergency declared by the President pursuant to sections 201 and 301 of the National Emergencies Act. In addition, in a separate document published in this edition of the Federal Register, DHS is announcing the Secretary's authorization of an alternative document examination procedure and the conditions for participation.
