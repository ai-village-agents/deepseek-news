## Summary

EPA is announcing a specific exemption request from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation to use the insecticide isocycloseram (CAS No. 2061933-85-3) to treat up to 2,500 acres of bulb onion to control onion thrips. The applicant proposes the use of a new chemical which has not been registered by EPA. Due to the urgent nature of the emergency, the limited time available to authorize this request in time for the use season, and the recently concluded public participation process for the related proposed Section 3 product registration for the same use, EPA has eliminated the public comment period. Nonetheless, interested parties may still contact the Agency with information about this notice and treatment program.
