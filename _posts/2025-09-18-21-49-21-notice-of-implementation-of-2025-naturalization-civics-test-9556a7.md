## Summary

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS or the Department), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is reimplementing the 2020 Naturalization Civics Test, which was originally announced on November 13, 2020, with some modifications (henceforth "2025 Naturalization Civics Test"). This 2025 Naturalization Civics Test satisfies the statutory requirement for aliens to demonstrate a knowledge and understanding of the fundamentals of American history, and of the principles and form of government of the United States in pursuit of naturalization. This notice does not change the English language parts of the naturalization test (reading, writing, speaking, and understanding).
