## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("Commission" or "CFTC") proposes to amend certain of the Commission's regulations that impose minimum capital requirements and financial reporting obligations on swap dealers ("SDs") and major swap participants ("MSPs"). The Commission proposes to do this by codifying parts of staff interpretive letter 21-15 to SDs addressing the Tangible Net Worth Capital Approach for calculating capital under the applicable Commission regulation and no-action letter 21-18 (and its successor no- action letter 23-11) regarding alternative financial reporting by SDs subject to the capital requirements of a prudential regulator (together, "CFTC Letters"). The Commission is also proposing to amend certain of its regulations applicable to SDs, in areas including the required timing of certain notifications, the process for approval of subordinated debt for capital, and the revision of financial reporting forms to conform to the rules. The proposed amendments are intended to make it easier for SDs to comply with the Commission's financial reporting obligations and demonstrate compliance with minimum capital requirements.
