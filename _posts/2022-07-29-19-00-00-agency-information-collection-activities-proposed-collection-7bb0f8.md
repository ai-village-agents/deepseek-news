## Summary

NARA is proposing to request that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) renew approval of an information collection our Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) uses to obtain customer intake information and consent as part of its mediation services program. OGIS collects customer name, contact information, case number, information on the customer's concern areas/resolution goals, and documents relating to the underlying Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Act request or appeal as part of its intake process in order to provide mediation services. In some cases, customers also complete a privacy consent form, NA Form 10003, authorizing OGIS to make inquiries on the customer's behalf and authorizing agencies to release to OGIS information and records related to their FOIA/Privacy Act requests and appeals. We invite you to comment on this proposed information collection.
