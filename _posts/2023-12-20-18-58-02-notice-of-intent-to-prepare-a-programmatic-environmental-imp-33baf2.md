## Summary

Consistent with the regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), BOEM announces its intent to prepare a PEIS to analyze the potential impacts of floating offshore wind energy development on the five leased areas offshore Humboldt and Morro Bay, California. The PEIS also will identify programmatic protective mitigation measures that if adopted could lessen those impacts. This NOI announces the scoping process BOEM will use to identify significant issues and potential alternatives for consideration in the California offshore wind (OSW) PEIS.
