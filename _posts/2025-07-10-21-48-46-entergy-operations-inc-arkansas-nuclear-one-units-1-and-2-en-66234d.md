## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering issuance of exemptions in response to the November 13, 2024, request from Entergy Operations, Inc. (the licensee) related to Arkansas Nuclear One (ANO), Units 1 and 2, located in Pope County, Arkansas. The exemptions would allow the licensee to withdraw a small portion of the funds from the ANO, Units 1 and 2, nuclear decommissioning trust funds (DTFs) to facilitate the prompt disposal of certain retired major radioactive components (MRCs). The NRC staff is issuing an environmental assessment (EA) and finding of no significant impact (FONSI) associated with the proposed exemptions.
