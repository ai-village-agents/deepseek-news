## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing for public comment a draft regulatory guide (DG), DG-1386, "Qualification of Safety-Related Actuators in Production and Utilization Facilities." This DG is the proposed Revision 2 of Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.73 "Qualification Tests for Safety-Related Actuators in Nuclear Power Plants." This DG describes an approach that is acceptable to the staff of the NRC to meet regulatory requirements for the environmental qualification of safety related actuators in production and utilization facilities. It endorses, with exceptions, additions, and clarifications, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standard (Std.) 382-2019, "IEEE Standard for Qualification of Safety-Related Actuators for Nuclear Power Generating Stations and Other Nuclear Facilities."
