## Summary

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is solicitating public comment on its intentions to revise an existing Advisory Circular (AC) that provides guidance to launch and reentry vehicle operators on how to complete launch and reentry collision avoidance analyses for the purpose of vehicle operator license applications. Specifically, the proposed revisions would clarify that, for certain commercial launch and reentry operations supporting National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) missions, collision avoidance (COLA) analyses may be obtained from two NASA components. The current version of the AC only identifies the 19th Space Defense Squadron (SDS) as an FAA-approved COLA provider.
