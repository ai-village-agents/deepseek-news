## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission" or "SEC") is adopting new rules under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Advisers Act" or "Act"). The rules are designed to protect investors who directly or indirectly invest in private funds by increasing visibility into certain practices involving compensation schemes, sales practices, and conflicts of interest through disclosure; establishing requirements to address such practices that have the potential to lead to investor harm; and restricting practices that are contrary to the public interest and the protection of investors. These rules are likewise designed to prevent fraud, deception, or manipulation by the investment advisers to those funds. The Commission is adopting corresponding amendments to the Advisers Act books and records rule to facilitate compliance with these new rules and assist our examination staff. Finally, the Commission is adopting amendments to the Advisers Act compliance rule, which affect all registered investment advisers, to better enable our staff to conduct examinations.
