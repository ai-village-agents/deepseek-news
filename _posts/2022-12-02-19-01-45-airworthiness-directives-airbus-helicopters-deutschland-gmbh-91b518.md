## Summary

The FAA is superseding airworthiness directive (AD) 77-04-06, which applied to Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm (MBB) (now Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (AHD)) Model BO-105A and BO-105 C helicopters; AD 2002-13-06, which applied to certain Eurocopter Deutschland GmbH (ECD) (now Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (AHD)) Model BO-105A, BO-105C, BO-105 C-2, BO-105 CB-2, BO-105 CB-4, BO-105 CS-2, BO-105 CBS-2, BO-105S, and BO-105LS A-1 helicopters; AD 2016-25- 14, which applied to certain Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (AHD) Model BO-105LS A-3 helicopters; and AD 2021-10-14, which applied to certain Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (AHD) Model BO-105A, BO- 105C, BO-105S, and BO-105LS A-3 helicopters. Since the FAA issued those ADs, new and more restrictive airworthiness limitations have been issued. This AD requires incorporating into existing maintenance records requirements (airworthiness limitations) as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also prohibits the installation of certain part- numbered tension-torsion (TT) straps. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
