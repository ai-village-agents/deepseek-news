## Summary

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS or Department) issues this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to revise 45 CFR 84.4(g) in the regulation implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (section 504) as it applies to recipients of HHS funding (entitled "Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance," 89 FR 40066 ("2024 Final Rule")), published on May 9, 2024. This rule clarifies that the Department interprets the statutory exclusion of "gender identity disorders not resulting from physical impairments" from the definitions of "individual with a disability" and "disability" set forth at 29 U.S.C. 705(9) & (20)(F)(i), 42 U.S.C. 12211(b), to encompass "gender dysphoria not resulting from a physical impairment" for purposes of part 84. This clarification is necessary to resolve ambiguity introduced in the preamble to the 2024 Final Rule and to ensure compliance with the best reading of the plain language of the governing statute.
