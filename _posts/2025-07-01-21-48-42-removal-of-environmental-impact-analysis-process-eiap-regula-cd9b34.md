## Summary

The DAF is rescinding its National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations because the Council on Environmental Quality's (CEQ) NEPA regulations, which they were meant to supplement, have been rescinded, and because the DoD is promulgating Department-wide NEPA procedures that will guide DAF's NEPA process.
