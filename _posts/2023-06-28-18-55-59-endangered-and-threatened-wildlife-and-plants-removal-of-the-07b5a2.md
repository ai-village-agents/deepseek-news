## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are removing the Okaloosa darter (Etheostoma okaloosae) from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife (List) due to recovery. This final rule is based on a thorough review of the best available scientific and commercial information which indicates that the threats to the species have been eliminated or reduced to the point that the species is no longer in danger of extinction or likely to become in danger of extinction within the foreseeable future. Therefore, the species no longer meets the definition of a threatened species, and does not meet the definition of an endangered species, under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Accordingly, the prohibitions and conservation measures provided by the Act will no longer apply to this species.
