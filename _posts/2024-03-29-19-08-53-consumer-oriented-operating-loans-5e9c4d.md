## Summary

The Rural Utilities Service (RUS or Agency), a Rural Development agency of the United States Department of Agriculture, is issuing this notice to announce it will be utilizing its long-standing statutory authority to consider operating loans under an initiative known as Consumer Oriented Operating Loans (COOL). COOL funding may be approved at the discretion of the RUS Administrator to finance operations for current system borrowers to meet financing needs where the borrower faces hardship circumstances involving unique, transitory, or exigent conditions. To qualify for COOL financing borrowers will commit to create environmental benefits to end users/consumers and invest in additional new carbon pollution-free electricity and/or energy efficiency measures. RUS estimates $50 million will be available for this program in fiscal year 2024.
