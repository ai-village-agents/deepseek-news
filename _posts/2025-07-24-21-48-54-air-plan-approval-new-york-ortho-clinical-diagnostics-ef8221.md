## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the State of New York's State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) related to a source-specific SIP (SSSIP) revision for Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, 513 Technology Boulevard, Rochester, New York (the Facility). The EPA is proposing to find that the control options in this SSSIP revision implement Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) with respect to volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from the relevant Facility source, which are identified as one solvent-based film coating machine. This SSSIP revision is intended to implement VOC RACT for the relevant Facility source in accordance with the requirements for implementation of the 2008 and 2015 ozone NAAQS. EPA proposes to determine that this action will not interfere with ozone NAAQS requirements and meets all applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
