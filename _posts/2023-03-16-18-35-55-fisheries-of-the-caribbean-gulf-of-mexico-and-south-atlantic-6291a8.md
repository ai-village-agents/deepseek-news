## Summary

NMFS issues regulations to implement management measures described in Framework Amendment 1 under the Fishery Management Plans for Puerto Rico, St. Croix, and St. Thomas and St. John (collectively, the island-based FMPs) (Framework Amendment 1). For spiny lobster, this final rule modifies annual catch limits (ACLs) in the U.S. Caribbean exclusive economic zone (EEZ) around Puerto Rico, St. Croix, and St. Thomas and St. John. The final rule also revises the accountability measure (AM) trigger for spiny lobster in the EEZ around each island group. The purpose of this final rule is to update management reference points for spiny lobster under the island-based FMPs, consistent with the best scientific information available to prevent overfishing and achieve optimum yield.
