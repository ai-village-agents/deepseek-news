## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily determines that passenger vehicle and light truck tires (PVLT) from Thailand were sold in the United States at less than normal value (NV) by Sentury Tire (Thailand) Co., Ltd. (Sentury) during the period of review (POR) July 1, 2023, through June 30, 2024.
