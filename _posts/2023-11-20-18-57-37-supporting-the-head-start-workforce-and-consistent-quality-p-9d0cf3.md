## Summary

We propose to add new requirements to the Head Start Program Performance Standards (HSPPS) to support and stabilize the Head Start workforce, including requirements for wages and benefits, breaks for staff, and enhanced supports for staff health and wellness. We also propose to enhance several existing requirements and add new requirements to promote consistent quality of services across Head Start programs. This includes proposed enhancements to requirements for mental health services to better integrate these services into every aspect of programs as well as elevate the role of mental health consultation to support the well-being of children, families, and staff. Enhancements are also proposed in the areas of family service, worker family assignments, identifying and meeting community needs, ensuring child safety, services for pregnant women and people, and alignment with State early childhood systems. Finally, we propose minor clarifications to existing standards to promote better transparency and clarity of understanding for grant recipients.
