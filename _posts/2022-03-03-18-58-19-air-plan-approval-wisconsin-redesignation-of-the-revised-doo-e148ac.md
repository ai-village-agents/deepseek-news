## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to find that the revised Door County (partial) nonattainment area in Wisconsin is attaining the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS or standard) and to act in accordance with a request from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) to redesignate the area to attainment of the 2015 ozone NAAQS, because the request meets the statutory requirements for redesignation under the Clean Air Act (CAA). Wisconsin submitted this request on January 5, 2022. EPA is also proposing to approve, as a revision to the Wisconsin State Implementation Plan (SIP), the emissions inventory for the area and the State's plan for maintaining the 2015 ozone NAAQS through 2035 in the area. Finally, EPA is proposing to approve Wisconsin's 2030 and 2035 volatile organic compound (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) Motor Vehicle Emission Budgets (budgets) for this area and initiating the adequacy review process for these budgets.
