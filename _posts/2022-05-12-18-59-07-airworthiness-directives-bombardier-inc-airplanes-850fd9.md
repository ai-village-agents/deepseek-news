## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-100-1A10 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that the nose wheel steering selector valve (SSV) can be slow to deactivate under low temperature conditions. This AD requires replacing the affected nose wheel SSV with a redesigned nose wheel SSV, and performing an operational test of the nose wheel SSV and nose wheel steering control system. This AD also prohibits the installation of a certain nose wheel SSV. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
