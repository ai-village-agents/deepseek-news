# Wireless Emergency Alerts; Emergency Alert System

## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) revises the Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) rules to allow alert originators the option to send "silent alerts" that do not trigger WEA's common audio attention signal or vibration cadence. This action grants alert originators greater flexibility in tailoring how WEA messages are presented. Further, to make as clear as possible to the public that any device marketed as a "WEA-capable mobile device" adheres to the full suite of WEA capabilities, the Commission also adopts its proposals to define a "WEA-capable mobile device," for the purpose of compliance with the Commission's WEA requirements.
