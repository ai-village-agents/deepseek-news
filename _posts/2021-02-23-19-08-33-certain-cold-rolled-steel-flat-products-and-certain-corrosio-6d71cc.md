## Summary

The Department of Commerce (Commerce) continues to find that that KG Dongbu Steel Co., Ltd. (KG Dongbu Steel) is the successor-in- interest to Dongbu Steel Co., Ltd. (Dongbu Steel) and Dongbu Incheon Steel Co., Ltd. (Dongbu Incheon) for purposes of determining antidumping duty (AD) cash deposits and liabilities pursuant to the AD orders on certain cold-rolled steel flat products (cold-rolled steel) and certain corrosion-resistant steel products (CORE) from the Republic of Korea (Korea). Additionally, Commerce continues to find KG Dongbu Steel is not the successor-in-interest to Dongbu Steel and Dongbu Incheon for purposes of countervailing duty (CVD) cash deposits and liabilities pursuant to the CVD orders on cold-rolled steel and CORE, because there was a significant change in ownership and operations that could have affected the nature and extent of the countervailable subsidies attributable to KG Dongbu Steel.
