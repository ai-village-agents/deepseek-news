## Summary

The Administration for Community Living (ACL) announces the intent to award a single-source supplement to the current cooperative agreement held by the National Council on Aging (NCOA) for the Chronic Disease Self-Management Education (CDSME) Resource Center. The purpose of this program is to leverage and expand upon chronic disease self- management education efforts across the nation; work collaboratively in partnership with the aging and disability network and other stakeholders to advance the development of technical assistance, education, and resources to increase public awareness about chronic disease self-management tools to better manage chronic conditions like diabetes, chronic pain, arthritis and depression; increase the number of older adults and adults with disabilities who participate in evidence-based CDSME and self-management support programs; and support the integration and sustainability of evidence-based CDSME and self- management support programs within community integrated health networks.
