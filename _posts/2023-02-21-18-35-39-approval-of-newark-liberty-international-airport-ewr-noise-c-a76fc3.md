## Summary

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its findings for the noise compatibility program submitted by EWR, see supplementary information for details. On January 15, 2019, the FAA determined that the noise exposure maps submitted by EWR were in compliance with applicable requirements. On August 19, 2022, the FAA determined that the noise compatibility program submitted by EWR would be initiating final review for approval or disapproval. On February 15, 2023, the FAA approved the EWR noise compatibility program. The noise compatibility program contained 28 recommended measures, including 13 noise abatement measures, three land use measures, and 12 program management measures. Of the measures proposed, 15 were approved, two were approved as voluntary, two were partially approved as voluntary and partially disapproved, five were disapproved, and one was determined to have no FAA action as continuations of existing mandatory practices at EWR. The remaining three measures are noise abatement procedures that require additional consultation with the Air Traffic Organization. The FAA will be issuing a supplemental ROA on or before August 14, 2023 to render determinations on these measures. Seven of the 13 noise abatement measures proposed at EWR are related to new or revised flight procedures.
