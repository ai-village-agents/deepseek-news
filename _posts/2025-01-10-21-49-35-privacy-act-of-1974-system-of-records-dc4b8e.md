## Summary

The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is modifying a system of records in its inventory of records systems subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. The system of records being modified is the Smuggling Interdiction and Trade Compliance (SITC) National Information Communication Activity System (SNICAS), USDA/APHIS-21. SNICAS maintains a record of activities conducted by the agency pursuant to its mission and authorized responsibilities. The purpose of the system is to record data and information about APHIS' SITC activities nationwide. We are modifying the system to exempt the system from certain provisions of the Privacy Act.
