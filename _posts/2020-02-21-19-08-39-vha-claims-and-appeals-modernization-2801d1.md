## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes to amend its regulations concerning its claims and appeals process governing various programs administrated by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 (AMA) amended the procedures applicable to administrative review and appeal of VA decisions on claims for benefits, creating a new, modernized review system. This rulemaking proposes amendments to sunset certain VHA regulations which are inconsistent with AMA.
