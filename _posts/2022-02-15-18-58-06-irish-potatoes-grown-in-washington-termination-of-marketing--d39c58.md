## Summary

This final rule terminates the Federal marketing order regulating the handling of Irish potatoes grown in Washington, and the rules and regulations issued thereunder. The marketing order is administered locally by the State of Washington Potato Committee (Committee), which unanimously recommended its termination at a meeting held on June 11, 2020. This recommendation is based on the Committee's determination that the marketing order is no longer an effective marketing tool for the Washington potato industry and that termination best serves the current needs of the industry by eliminating the costs associated with its operation.
