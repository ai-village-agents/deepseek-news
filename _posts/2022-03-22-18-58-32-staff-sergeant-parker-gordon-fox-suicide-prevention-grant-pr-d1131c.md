## Summary

On March 10, 2022, the Department of Veterans Affairs published in the Federal Register an interim final rule to implement a new authority requiring VA to implement a three-year community-based grant program to award grants to eligible entities to provide or coordinate the provision of suicide prevention services to eligible individuals and their families for the purpose of reducing veteran suicide. This correction addresses minor technical and inadvertent errors in the published interim final rule.
