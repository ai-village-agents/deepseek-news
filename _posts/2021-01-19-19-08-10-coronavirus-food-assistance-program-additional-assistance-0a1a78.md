## Summary

The Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) provides assistance to agricultural producers impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak. The Secretary of Agriculture implemented CFAP through two rounds of payments (CFAP 1 and CFAP 2). This rule amends the CFAP 1 provisions to provide additional assistance for swine producers who previously applied for assistance during the CFAP 1 application period. This rule also amends the CFAP 2 provisions to provide assistance for certain swine and poultry contract producers, clarify eligible sales-based commodities, add additional commodities that are eligible for payment, change the payment calculation for sales-based commodities, and change the yield used to calculate payment for price-trigger crops for certain applicants. The change to the payment calculation for sales-based commodities is being made to implement a change required by the recently enacted Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. Other changes to CFAP in this rule are discretionary changes being made in response to ongoing evaluation of CFAP and the need to provide additional assistance.
