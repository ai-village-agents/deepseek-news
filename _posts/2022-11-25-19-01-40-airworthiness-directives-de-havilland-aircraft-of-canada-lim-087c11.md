## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited Model DHC-8-401 and -402 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by an investigation of incorrectly manufactured sleeves that were potentially installed in the main landing gear (MLG) forward door linkage assembly. This proposed AD would require review of technical records and inspections to determine if a discrepant sleeve is installed, replacement of any discrepant sleeve and re-identification of the MLG forward door linkage assembly. This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
