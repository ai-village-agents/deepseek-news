# In the Matter of Upper C-band (3.98-4.2 GHz)

## Summary

In this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) seeks comment on proposed rule changes that would expand the ecosystem for next generation wireless services in the 3.7-4.2 GHz band (C-band) by making as much as 180, and at least 100, megahertz of the 3.98-4.2 GHz band (Upper C-band) available for terrestrial wireless flexible use via a system of competitive bidding. This action would be in furtherance of Congress' direction in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB Act) to "complet[e] a system of competitive bidding not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act for not less than 100 megahertz in the band between 3.98 gigahertz and 4.2 gigahertz." The NPRM seeks comment on options for reconfiguring the Upper C-band in the contiguous United States ranging from 180 megahertz (3.98-4.16 GHz) to the congressionally mandated minimum of 100 megahertz (3.98-4.08 GHz) for terrestrial wireless use. The NPRM seeks comment on how much Upper C- band spectrum--beyond the minimum 100 megahertz required by the OBBB Act--could be repurposed by incumbent fixed satellite service (FSS) space station operators and on how the transition could be effectuated if their existing customers relocate out of the C-band. Under any of the reconfiguration options under consideration, the NPRM's baseline proposition is to apply the existing 3.7 GHz Service rules (applicable in the Lower C-band from 3.7-3.98 GHz) to any newly authorized terrestrial wireless operations. Any other rules and requirements, including those relating to the transition process, would be modeled to the greatest extent possible on those that applied to the Lower C-band transition. The NPRM also seeks comment on a range of issues associated with repurposing some portion of the Upper C-band, including: reallocation of the 4.0-4.2 GHz band; competitive bidding procedures for an eventual auction; licensing, operating, and technical rules for any new wireless services; (4) transitioning incumbent FSS operations; and promoting co-existence with adjacent band radio altimeters.
