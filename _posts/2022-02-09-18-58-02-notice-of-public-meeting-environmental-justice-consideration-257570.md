## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is hosting two identical public meetings to discuss and solicit input on environmental justice considerations related to the development of the proposed per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) national primary drinking water regulation (NPDWR) under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). In the context of developing this proposed regulation, environmental justice considerations include the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies with a particular focus on unique challenges faced by communities disproportionately burdened by environmental harms and risks. EPA is holding these meetings to share information and provide an opportunity for communities to offer input on the development of the proposed PFAS NPDWR. Information on how to register and request to speak during one of the meetings is detailed in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section of this announcement.
