Those interested in providing comments or information regarding site conditions, resources, and multiple uses in close proximity to or within the Call area should provide the information requested in section 7, "Requested Information from Interested or Affected Parties," under the "Supplementary Information" heading of this Call. Those interested in leasing within the Call area for a commercial wind energy project should provide the information described in section 8, "Required Nomination Information," under "Supplementary Information." BOEM may or may not offer a lease for a commercial offshore wind energy project within the Call area after further government consultations, public participation, and environmental analyses.
