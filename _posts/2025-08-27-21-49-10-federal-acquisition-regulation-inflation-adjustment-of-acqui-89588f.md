## Summary

OFPP, DoD, GSA, and NASA (collectively referred to as the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, or FAR Council) are issuing a final rule amending the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to further implement a statute, which requires an adjustment every five years of statutory acquisition-related thresholds for inflation. The adjustment uses the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers and does not apply to the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute, Service Contract Labor Standards statute, performance and payment bonds, and trade agreements thresholds. OFPP, DoD, GSA, and NASA are also using the same methodology to adjust nonstatutory FAR acquisition-related thresholds in 2025.
