## Summary

USAID invites public comment on our intent to request the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) approval for a new information collection. The Foreign Assistance Transparency and Accountability Act (2016) and The Foundations for Evidence Based Policy-Making Act (2019) enhance the transparency, accuracy, and reliability of USAID program and activity evaluations and processes of data collection and reporting. To comply with these Acts, USAID is currently revising the policy associated with its Evaluation Report Requirements. The requirements collect information from evaluators to establish the validity of research methodologies, standardize the presentation of research, ensure accuracy, and identify any conflicts of interest that could create bias or influence data analysis, findings, or recommendations. USAID is soliciting comments for this collection.
