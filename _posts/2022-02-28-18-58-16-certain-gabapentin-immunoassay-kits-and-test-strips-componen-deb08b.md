## Summary

Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has determined not to review an initial determination ("ID") (Order No. 29) terminating the final, non-defaulting respondent, Shanghai Chemtron Biotech Co. Ltd., in the above-captioned investigation based on settlement. The Commission has further determined to find that the complainants' declaration seeking immediate relief against a respondent previously found to be in default is moot. The Commission also requests written submissions from the parties, interested government agencies, and interested persons on remedy, the public interest, and bonding concerning the defaulted respondent.
