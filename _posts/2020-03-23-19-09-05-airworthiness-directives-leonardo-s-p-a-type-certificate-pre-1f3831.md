## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-07-08, which applies to certain Leonardo S.p.A (type certificate previously held by Agusta S.p.A) Model A109E, A109K2, A109S, AW109SP, A119, and AW119 MKII helicopters. AD 2018-07-08 requires reducing the life limit of the tail rotor blade retention bolt and an inspection of that bolt for cracking, and replacement of any cracked bolt. Since issuing AD 2018-07-08, the FAA has determined that repetitive inspections of the tail rotor blade retention bolt are needed to address the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would continue to require reducing the life limit of the tail rotor blade retention bolt, inspecting that bolt for cracking, and replacing any cracked bolt. In addition, this proposed AD would require repetitive inspections of the tail rotor blade retention bolt for cracking. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
