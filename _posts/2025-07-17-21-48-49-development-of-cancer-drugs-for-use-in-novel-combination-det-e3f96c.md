## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled "Development of Cancer Drugs for Use in Novel Combination--Determining the Contribution of the Individual Drugs' Effects." This draft guidance is intended for sponsors developing drugs for use in combination for the treatment of cancer and provides recommendations for characterizing the safety and effectiveness of individual drugs for use in a novel combination regimen in oncology (i.e., demonstrating the contribution of each drug to the overall effect that is observed for the population). This guidance expands on the recommendations in the 2013 guidance for industry entitled "Codevelopment of Two or More New Investigational Drugs for Use in Combination." This guidance does not address contribution of effect in settings where an investigational drug is being developed in combination with a drug approved for the same indication for the purposes of comparing the approved drug to the combination or to fixed combinations of previously approved drugs for the approved indication(s).
