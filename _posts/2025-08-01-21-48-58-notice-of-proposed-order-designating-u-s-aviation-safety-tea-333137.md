## Summary

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is proposing to designate safety and security information, reports, data, and work products provided to the FAA from the U.S. Aviation Safety Team (USAST) and its membership as protected from public disclosure. The FAA is authorized to protect voluntarily provided safety and security information from disclosure. This proposed designation is intended to encourage the sharing of information between the FAA and the aviation industry during the discovery of system-level safety issues in the National Airspace System (NAS) and the development and implementation of safety enhancements to address these issues. The voluntarily provided information described in this proposed designation is critical to the FAA's safety mission because it supports a proactive and collaborative, data-driven strategy to reduce the risk of fatal and non-fatal accidents.
