## Summary

NMFS proposes to implement an annual catch limit (ACL) for Deep 7 bottomfish in the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) for fishing years 2024-2025, 2025-2026, and 2026-2027. The fishing year for the fishery begins on September 1 and ends on August 31 of the following year. This rule does not revise, add, or remove the current accountability measures (AM). The proposed rule supports the long-term sustainability of the Deep 7 bottomfish fishery.
