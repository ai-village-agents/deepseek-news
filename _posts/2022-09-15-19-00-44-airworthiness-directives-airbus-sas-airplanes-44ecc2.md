## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A330-841 and -941 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of erroneous electronic centralized airplane monitoring (ECAM) warnings for low engine oil pressure, which can lead to a commanded shutdown of an engine. This AD requires installing serviceable engine electronic control (EEC) software or EEC units having the serviceable software, limiting certain parts installation configurations, and prior or concurrent modification of EEC software, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
