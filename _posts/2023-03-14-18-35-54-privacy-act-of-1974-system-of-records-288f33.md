## Summary

Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, notice is hereby given that the General Services Administration (GSA) proposes to rescind the system GSA/HRO-2--Employee Drug Abuse Alcoholism Files, as the records are now with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), not GSA, as GSA entered an interagency agreement with HHS for support so the records are covered by the HHS SORN, 09-90-0010, Employee Assistance Program (EAP) Records.
