## Summary

The FAA is correcting an airworthiness directive (AD) that was published in the Federal Register. That AD applies to all ATR-GIE Avions de Transport Regional Model ATR42 and ATR72 airplanes. As published, the docket number specified in the preamble and regulatory text is incorrect. This document corrects that error. In all other respects, the original document remains the same.
