## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") has determined that air cleaners qualify as a covered product under Part A of Title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended ("EPCA"). DOE has determined that classifying air cleaners as covered products is necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of EPCA, and that the average U.S. household energy use for air cleaners is likely to exceed 100 kilowatt-hours per year.
