## Summary

The Department of State ("Department") is issuing this document to state its interpretation of certain provisions in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) regarding the availability of immigrant visa numbers in categories subject to an annual numerical limit. To ensure that Department practice is consistent with these INA provisions, future Visa Bulletins, beginning with the April 2023 Visa Bulletin, will reflect this interpretation with respect to the availability of employment-based preference visas for applicants from the Northern Central American countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras ("NCA Countries").
