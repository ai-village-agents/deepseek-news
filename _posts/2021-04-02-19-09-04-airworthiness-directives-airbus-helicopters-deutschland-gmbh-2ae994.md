## Summary

The FAA is withdrawing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) that would have applied to certain Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH Model EC135P1, EC135T1, EC135P2, EC135T2, EC135P2+, EC135T2+, EC135P3, and EC135T3 helicopters. The NPRM was prompted by a deviation from a new manufacturing process and a determination that the deviation resulted in a reduced life limit (service life limit) for certain tail rotor (TR) blades. The NPRM would have required a reduced life limit for those TR blades and require a new life limit for certain other TR blades. Since issuance of the NPRM, the FAA has determined that the deviation from the new manufacturing process does not reduce the life limit of certain TR blades and that a new life limit is not needed for certain other blades. Accordingly, the NPRM is withdrawn.
