## Summary

On October 7, 2022, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) updated the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to implement necessary controls on advanced computing integrated circuits (ICs), computer commodities that contain such ICs, and certain semiconductor manufacturing items, and to make other changes to the EAR to ensure that appropriate controls are in place for these items, including specific activities of "U.S. persons." This rule makes an initial update to the controls to more effectively achieve the policy objectives identified in previous regulations by adding the same controls implemented on China in that rule to Macau. The public may submit comments on the controls in the October 7 advanced computing and semiconductor manufacturing equipment rule, which BIS is extending to Macau in this rule. BIS intends to publish a subsequent rule to respond to the comments received, including making updates to the controls included in the October 7 advanced computing and semiconductor manufacturing equipment rule.
