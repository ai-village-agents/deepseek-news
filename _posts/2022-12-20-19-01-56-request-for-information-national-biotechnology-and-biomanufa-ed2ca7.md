## Summary

The President's Executive Order on Advancing Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Innovation for a Sustainable, Safe, and Secure American Bioeconomy launched a National Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Initiative (NBBI) to advance biotechnology and biomanufacturing towards innovative solutions in health, climate change, energy, food security, agriculture, and supply chain resilience, and to advance national and economic security. Biotechnology and biomanufacturing offer new opportunities to strengthen supply chains and lower prices, create more sustainable products through bio-based production, expand domestic production of goods and materials, create jobs across all of America, and spur new opportunities in agricultural communities, as some examples. This RFI seeks public input on how advances in biotechnology and biomanufacturing can help us achieve goals that were previously out of reach and what steps can be taken to ensure we have the right research ecosystem, workforce, data, domestic biomanufacturing capacity, and other components to support a strong bioeconomy.
