## Summary

In accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, the Department of Health and Human Services is updating and renaming an existing system of records maintained by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), 09-25-0165, "National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Loan Repayment and Scholarship (OLRS) Record System, HHS/NIH/OD" (to be renamed "NIH Loan Repayment Records"). In a separate Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) published elsewhere in today's Federal Register, HHS/NIH is proposing to exempt a subset of records in the system of records from certain requirements of the Privacy Act, based on subsection (k)(5) of the Privacy Act.
