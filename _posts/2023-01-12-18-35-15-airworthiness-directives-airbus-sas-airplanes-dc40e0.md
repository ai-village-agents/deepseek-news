## Summary

The FAA is removing Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-25-03, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A318, A319, A320, and A321 series airplanes. AD 2020-25-03 required repetitive checks of the pressure gauges to determine the amount of pressure on the inflation reservoir of each emergency escape slide/raft, and applicable corrective actions. AD 2020-25-03 also provided optional terminating action for the repetitive checks. The FAA issued AD 2020-25-03 to address insufficient reservoir pressure in an emergency escape slide/raft, which would prevent the deployment of the emergency escape slide/raft during an emergency, possibly resulting in injury to the occupants. The FAA has determined that AD 2020-25-03 is no longer necessary because the unsafe condition no longer exists. Accordingly, AD 2020-25-03 is removed.
