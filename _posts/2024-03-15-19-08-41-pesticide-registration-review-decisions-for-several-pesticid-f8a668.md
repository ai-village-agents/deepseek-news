## Summary

In the Federal Register of March 7, 2024, EPA issued a notice to announce the availability of EPA's interim registration review decision for etofenprox, and the final registration review decision for acetominophen. That notice incorrectly included a DATES section that established a comment deadline of May 6, 2024. A comment period is not necessary or appropriate for that document because the decision announced in that document are final for the interim phase of the process for etofenprox and a final decision for acetominophen. This document corrects that document by reaffirming the nature of all the decisions announced in that document and by closing the comment period it incorrectly established.
