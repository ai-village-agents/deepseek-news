## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), in cooperation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, is issuing for public comment a draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS). The draft SEIS is in response to an application submitted by Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) for a construction permit (CP) to construct one GE Hitachi BWRX-300 reactor at a site in Roane County, Tennessee, designated as Clinch River Nuclear Site, Unit 1 (CRN-1). The draft SEIS evaluates the environmental impacts of the proposed action of issuing a CP that would allow the construction of CRN-1.
