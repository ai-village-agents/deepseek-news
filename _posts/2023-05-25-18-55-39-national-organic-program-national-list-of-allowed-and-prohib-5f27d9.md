## Summary

On February 28, 2022, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) published a rule removing sixteen substances from the National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances (National List). That document accidentally omitted nonorganic whey protein concentrate from the amendatory instructions. This document corrects the amendatory language, removing nonorganic whey protein concentrate from the National List, as intended in the previous document.
