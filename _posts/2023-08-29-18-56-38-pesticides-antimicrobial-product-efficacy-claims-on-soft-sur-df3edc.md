## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the availability of revised guidance and methods for adding efficacy claims to antimicrobial products for use on soft surface textiles in non- residential settings. Revisions to the guidance document and associated methods were made based on the Agency's consideration of public comments received. Specifically, EPA is announcing the availability of a guidance document that describes efficacy testing for antimicrobial products to support claims for use on soft surface textiles in clinical and institutional (non-residential) settings and how to prepare an application for registration, a quantitative method for evaluating the efficacy of antimicrobial products on soft surface textiles against viruses, and a quantitative method for evaluating the efficacy of antimicrobial products on soft surface textiles against bacteria. The guidance does not address residential use sites, clothing, frequently laundered items, untreated wood, concrete and other hard porous materials, carpet or rugs, or the backing material/stuffing under the soft surface textile (e.g., beyond what can be visibly observed).
