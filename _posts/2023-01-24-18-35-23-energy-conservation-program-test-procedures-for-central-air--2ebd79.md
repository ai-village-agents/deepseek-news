## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is undertaking the preliminary stages of a rulemaking to consider amendments to the test procedure for central air conditioners and heat pumps. Through this request for information ("RFI"), DOE seeks data and information regarding issues pertinent to whether amended test procedures would more accurately or fully comply with the requirement that the test procedure produces results that measure energy use during a representative average use cycle or period of use for the product without being unduly burdensome to conduct, or reduce testing burden. DOE welcomes written comments from the public on any subject within the scope of this document (including topics not raised in this RFI), as well as the submission of data and other relevant information.
