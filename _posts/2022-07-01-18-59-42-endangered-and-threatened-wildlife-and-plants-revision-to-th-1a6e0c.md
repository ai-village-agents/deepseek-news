## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service or USFWS), revise the regulations for the nonessential experimental population of the Mexican wolf (Canis lupus baileyi) in the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area under section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (ESA). The regulatory revisions in this rule include a revised population objective, a new genetic objective, and the temporary restriction of three take provisions. This rule also includes an essentiality determination under section 10(j) of the ESA. The experimental population, inclusive of these revisions, will contribute to the long-term conservation and recovery of the Mexican wolf by alleviating demographic and genetic threats in this population consistent with our rangewide recovery strategy and goals for the Mexican wolf.
