## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("Commission" or "CFTC") is adopting amendments in this final rule ("Final Rule") to conform regulations concerning speculative position limits to the relevant Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010 ("Dodd-Frank Act") amendments to the Commodity Exchange Act ("CEA"). Among other regulatory amendments, the Commission is adopting: New and amended Federal spot-month limits for 25 physical commodity derivatives; amended single month and all-months-combined limits for most of the agricultural contracts currently subject to Federal position limits; new and amended definitions for use throughout the position limits regulations, including a revised definition of "bona fide hedging transaction or position" and a new definition of "economically equivalent swaps"; amended rules governing exchange-set limit levels and grants of exemptions therefrom; a new streamlined process for bona fide hedging recognitions for purposes of Federal position limits; new enumerated bona fide hedges; and amendments to certain regulatory provisions that would eliminate Form 204 while also enabling the Commission to leverage and receive cash-market reporting submitted directly to the exchanges by market participants.
