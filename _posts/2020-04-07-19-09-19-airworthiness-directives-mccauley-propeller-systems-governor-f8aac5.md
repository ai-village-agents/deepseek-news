## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain model McCauley Propeller Systems (McCauley) governors installed on airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of an unapproved variant McCauley idler gear bearing, part number (P/N) A- 20028, that could be installed in the affected governors. This proposed AD would require replacing the governor with a governor that is eligible for installation. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
