## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Developmental Studies to improve the National Health Care Surveys. The goal of the project is to cover new survey research that will evaluate and improve upon survey design and operations, as well as examine the feasibility and address challenges that may arise with future expansions of the National Health Care Surveys.
