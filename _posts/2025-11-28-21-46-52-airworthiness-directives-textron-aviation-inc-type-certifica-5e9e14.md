## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Textron Aviation, Inc., Model 525B airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by the manufacturer's revision of the aircraft maintenance manual (AMM) to introduce more restrictive inspection intervals. This proposed AD would require revising the Airworthiness Limitations Section (ALS) of the existing AMM or instructions for continued airworthiness (ICA) and the existing approved maintenance or inspection program, as applicable. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
