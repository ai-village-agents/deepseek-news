## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves aerial navigation aids (NavAids), electrical/electronic facilities, owned and operated by non-federal sponsors for use by the flying public. "Non-Federal sponsors" refers to entities such as State and local governments, businesses, and private citizens. The information to be collected is necessary to ensure that operation and maintenance of these non-federally owned facilities is in accordance with FAA safety standards. The FAA is not changing its information-collection practices pertaining to non-Federal facilities. It is merely renewing its legal authority to collect that information.
