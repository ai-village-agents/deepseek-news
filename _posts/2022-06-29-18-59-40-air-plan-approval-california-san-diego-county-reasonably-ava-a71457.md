## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve revisions to the San Diego Air Pollution Control District (SDAPCD or "District") portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern SDAPCD's negative declarations for certain Control Techniques Guidelines (CTGs) as they apply to the 2008 and 2015 ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or "standards") reasonably available control technology (RACT) SIP. We are approving revisions that regulate these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act). This approval stops all sanction and federal implementation plan clocks started by our December 3, 2020 partial approval and partial disapproval.
