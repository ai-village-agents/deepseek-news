## Summary

On August 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") published a request for information regarding energy conservation standards for commercial and industrial pumps ("pumps"). In this notice of data availability ("NODA"), DOE is publishing an overview of potential technology/design options and associated estimated national energy savings with preliminary industry net present value estimates for certain pump equipment classes in order to provide stakeholders with additional information and to assist DOE in determining how to proceed with the rulemaking. The analysis presented in this NODA is consistent with the scope that DOE proposed in a test procedure notice of proposed rulemaking for commercial and industrial pumps published on April 11, 2022. DOE requests comments, data, and information regarding its analysis.
