## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-1A10 and BD-700-1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports that the thrust reverser correction factors presented in certain airplane flight manual (AFM) performance charts for landing on contaminated runways do not provide sufficient margin for stopping distances in certain conditions. This AD requires revising the existing AFM to correct the affected performance charts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
