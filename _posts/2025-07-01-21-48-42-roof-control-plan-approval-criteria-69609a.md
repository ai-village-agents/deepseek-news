## Summary

MSHA is proposing to revise its roof control plan regulations to eliminate the provision that allows the District Manager to require additional measures to be included in plans. The current regulation may violate statutory authority; the Appointments Clause, by vesting significant regulatory authority in District Managers; and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), by skipping notice and comment.
