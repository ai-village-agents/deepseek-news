## Summary

The FAA proposes to rule and invites public comment on the application for a release of approximately 0.12 acres of federally obligated airport property at Francis S. Gabreski Airport, Southampton, New York, from both the Federal Surplus Property obligations contained in the July 12, 1972 Quitclaim Deed, and the Grant Assurance obligations. This acreage is composed of one parcel of land that was transferred from the United States of America to the County of Suffolk under the provisions of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 and the Surplus Property Act of 1944. The release will allow the airport to enter into a long-term non-aeronautical lease with the Suffolk County Water Authority (SCWA) for a water booster pump station. The proposed use of land after the release will be compatible with the airport and will not interfere with the airport or its operation.
