## Summary

This action corrects a final rule published in the Federal Register on June 2, 2025, that removes Class D and E4 airspace, establishes Class E2 airspace, and amends Class E5 airspace at Aberdeen, MD, at the request of the U.S. Army. This action corrects that rule by removing verbiage in the Aberdeen, MD, Class E2 airspace legal description that erroneously indicates a part-time status of that airspace.
