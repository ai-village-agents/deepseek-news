## Summary

This interim final rule revises the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) procedures implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). TVA is taking this action in response to the amendments to NEPA enacted through the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025, to reflect the Supreme Court's recent decision in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado, and to align with Executive Order (E.O.) 14154, Unleashing American Energy, and the Council on Environmental Quality's (CEQ) subsequent recission of its NEPA implementing regulations, which TVA's procedures were intended to supplement. This interim final rule requests comments on this action and TVA's intent to move its procedures at Subpart G, for compliance with E.O. 11988, Floodplain Management, and E.O. 11990, Protection of Wetlands, into a new part 1319 of the CFR, to inform TVA's decision-making.
