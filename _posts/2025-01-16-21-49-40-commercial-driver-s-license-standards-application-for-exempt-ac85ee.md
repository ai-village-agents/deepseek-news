## Summary

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) announces its final decision to grant a 5-year exemption to Daimler Trucks North America, LLC (Daimler) for six drivers who hold foreign commercial licenses from the requirement to hold a commercial driver's license (CDL) issued by a U.S. State when operating a commercial motor vehicle (CMV). This exemption will permit the six drivers to test-drive Daimler vehicles on U.S. roads to better understand product requirements in "real-world" environments and verify results. FMCSA reviewed the drivers' commercial license records provided by Daimler and believes the requirements for a German commercial license, the work restrictions imposed on Daimler drivers by their nonimmigrant visas, and the terms and conditions set forth below, will ensure that Daimler's operation under this exemption will likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to or greater than the level that would be achieved in the absence of the exemption.
