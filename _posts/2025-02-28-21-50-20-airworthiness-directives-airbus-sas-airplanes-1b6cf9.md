## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-11- 08, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A330-841 and -941 airplanes. AD 2023-11-08 required maintenance actions, including a high-pressure valve (HPV) seal integrity test, repetitive replacement of the HPV clips, revision of the existing airplane flight manual (AFM), and implementation of updates to the FAA-approved operator's minimum equipment list (MEL). This AD was prompted by the determination that the replacement intervals required by AD 2023-11-08 must be reduced to address the unsafe condition. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2023-11-08. This AD also reduces the HPV clip replacement intervals, requires an additional revision of the existing AFM for certain airplanes, and limits the installation of HPV clips, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
