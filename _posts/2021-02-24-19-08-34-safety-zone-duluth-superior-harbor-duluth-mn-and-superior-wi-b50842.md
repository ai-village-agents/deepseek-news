## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for certain waters of Duluth-Superior Harbor encompassed by a box from Connor's Point Marina in Superior, WI to Rice's Point in Duluth, MN and extending 100 yards from four (4) barges placed across the waterway. This action is necessary to protect the safety of life on these navigable waters of Duluth-Superior Harbor near the Blatnik Bridge for an extreme sports event. This rulemaking would prohibit persons, vehicles, and vessels from entering, transiting, or anchoring in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Duluth or a designated representative.
