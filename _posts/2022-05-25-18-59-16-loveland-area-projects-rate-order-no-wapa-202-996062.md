## Summary

The Rocky Mountain Region (RMR) of the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) proposes revised formula rates for the Loveland Area Projects (LAP) firm electric service and sale of surplus products. LAP consists of the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project (Fry-Ark) and the Pick- Sloan Missouri Basin Program (P-SMBP)--Western Division (WD), which were integrated for marketing and rate-making purposes in 1989. The existing formula rates for these services, under Rate Schedules L-F11 and L-M2, expire on December 31, 2022. RMR is proposing to update the formula rates for firm electric service under Rate Schedule L-F12 and sale of surplus products under Rate Schedule L-M3, effective January 1, 2023, through December 31, 2027.
