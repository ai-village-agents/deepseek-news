## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500- 1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of flight control (horizontal stabilizer, rudder, and elevator) decals degrading and peeling (damage), reports of operators painting over these decals, and reports that procedures to replace these decals were inaccurate, potentially causing incorrect positioning of replacement decals. This AD requires inspecting the left and right horizontal stabilizer decals for visibility and damage; and for certain airplanes, inspecting the rudder and left and right elevator decals for visibility and damage; and doing applicable corrective actions; as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
