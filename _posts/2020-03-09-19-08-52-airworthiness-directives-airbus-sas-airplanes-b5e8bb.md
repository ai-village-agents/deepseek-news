## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-25-16, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A330-200 Freighter, A330-200, A330-300, A340-200, A340-300, A340-500, and A340-600 series airplanes. AD 2017-25-16 requires repetitive inspections of certain fuel pumps for cavitation erosion, corrective action if necessary, and revision of the minimum equipment list (MEL). Since the FAA issued AD 2017-25-16, the FAA has determined that the inspection area must be expanded, and Model A330-941 airplanes are also subject to the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would retain the requirements of AD 2017- 25-16, expand the inspection area, add certain maintenance actions, and expand the applicability, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which will be incorporated by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
