## Summary

The FAA is correcting an airworthiness directive (AD) that published in the Federal Register. That AD applies to all The Boeing Company Model 757 airplanes. As published, the reference for revising the existing maintenance or inspection program specified in the regulatory text is incorrect. This document corrects that error. In all other respects, the original document remains the same.
