## Summary

Pursuant to a delegation of authority from the Secretary of Transportation, the Maritime Administrator is authorized to issue an Aquaculture Support Operations Waiver to U.S. documented vessels with registry endorsements or foreign flag vessels in operations that treat aquaculture fish or protect aquaculture fish from disease, parasitic infestation, or other threats to their health upon a finding that suitable vessels of the United States are not available that could perform those operations. MARAD has received an Aquaculture Support Operations waiver request and is publishing this notice to solicit comments that may assist MARAD in determining whether suitable vessels of the United States are available that could perform the proposed aquaculture support operations set forth in the request. A brief description of the proposed aquaculture support operations is listed in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section below.
