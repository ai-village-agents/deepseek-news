## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-01-09 for certain Stemme AG Model Stemme S 10-VT and Model Stemme S 12 gliders. AD 2022-01-09 required removing the affected freewheel clutch from service and prohibited the installation of affected parts. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-01-09, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) superseded its mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) to amend the definition of an affected part. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2022-01-09 for removing the affected freewheel clutch from service and continues to prohibit the installation of an affected part, and amends the definition of an affected part and clarifies the part installation prohibition. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
