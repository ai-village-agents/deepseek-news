## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH Model MBB-BK 117 D-2 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by the discovery that certain longitudinal trim actuators, lateral trim actuators, and yaw trim actuators, which are certified for installation on MBB-BK117 C-2 helicopters, were erroneously listed as eligible for installation on MBB-BK 117 D-2 helicopters. This proposed AD would require removing the affected parts from service and prohibit installing the affected parts on MBB-BK 117 D-2 helicopters. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
