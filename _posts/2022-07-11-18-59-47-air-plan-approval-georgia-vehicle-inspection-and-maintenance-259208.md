## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of Georgia through the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (GA DNR), Environmental Protection Division (GA EPD) on April 30, 2021. The revisions remove obsolete references and provisions, update and clarify the State's inspection and maintenance (I/M) requirements, and update terminology, in part to reflect advances in test and vehicle technology. EPA has evaluated the SIP revisions and has preliminarily determined the changes will not increase emissions under the Georgia I/ M program. EPA is proposing to approve these changes pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA).
