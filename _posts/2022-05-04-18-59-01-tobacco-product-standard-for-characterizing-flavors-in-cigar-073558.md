## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is proposing a tobacco product standard that would prohibit characterizing flavors (other than tobacco) in all cigars and their components and parts. Characterizing flavors in cigars, such as strawberry, grape, cocoa, and fruit punch, increase appeal and make the cigars easier to use, particularly among youth and young adults. Over a half million youth in the United States use flavored cigars. This proposed product standard would reduce the appeal of cigars, particularly to youth and young adults, and thereby decrease the likelihood of experimentation, development of nicotine dependence, and progression to regular use. FDA is taking this action to reduce the tobacco-related death and disease associated with cigar use. The proposed standard also is expected to reduce tobacco-related health disparities and advance health equity.
