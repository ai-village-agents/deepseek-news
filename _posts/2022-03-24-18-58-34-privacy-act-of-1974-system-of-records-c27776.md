## Summary

The system contains information provided by the contractor's employees including such information as their applicable vaccination or medical countermeasure status and whether they are experiencing symptoms associated with the public health emergency. Each contractor with employees who will work in DOL facilities (regardless of whether the contract is with DOL or another Federal agency such as GSA) will be asked to confirm if its employees have been vaccinated or have received appropriate medical countermeasures, in addition, the contractor will be required to ensure that its employees follow the guidelines specified for working in DOL facilities, for example, to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, not fully vaccinated employees are required to wear masks and maintain physical distancing. Visitors to DOL facilities will also be asked to provide information about their vaccination or medical countermeasure status and information about whether they are experiencing any symptoms associated with the public health emergency. Contractors, special government employees and student volunteers may also be asked to provide proof of their vaccination status.
