HRSA announces the award of a supplement for a total of approximately $1 million in fiscal year (FY) 2023 for the Early Childhood Developmental Health Systems (ECDHS) cooperative agreement. The supplement will provide approximately $600,000 to the current recipient during the period of September 30, 2023, to September 29, 2024, to continue to support the implementation, spread, and scale of early childhood development (ECD) expert integration, and associated early childhood systems development.
