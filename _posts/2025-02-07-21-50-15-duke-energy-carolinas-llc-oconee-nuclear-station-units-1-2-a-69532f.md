## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has published a final site-specific environmental impact statement (EIS), issued as NUREG-1437, Supplement 2, Second Renewal, "Site-Specific Environmental Impact Statement for License Renewal of Nuclear Plants Regarding Subsequent License Renewal for Oconee Nuclear Station, Units 1, 2, and 3, Final Report." This EIS evaluates, on a site-specific basis, the environmental impacts of subsequent renewal of Renewed Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-38, DPR-47, and DPR-55 for an additional 20 years of operation for Oconee Nuclear Station, Units 1, 2, and 3 (Oconee Station), respectively. Oconee Station is located in Seneca, South Carolina, approximately 30 miles west of Greenville. Possible alternatives to the proposed action of subsequent license renewal for Oconee Station include the no-action alternative, a new nuclear alternative, a natural gas combined-cycle alternative, and a combination alternative.
