## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA or Department) amends its regulations concerning the standards of ethical conduct and related responsibilities of its employees by adopting an overarching principle- based ethics framework for access to and use of veteran data. This framework is an important part of VA's data governance strategy. A data ethics framework can ensure uniform ethics standards for data practices and address consumer protection and data stewardship concerns that are beyond traditional privacy and confidentiality practices. This framework is intended to be applied by all parties who oversee the access to, sharing of, or the use of veteran data, or who access, share, or use veteran data themselves in the context of all other specific clinical, technical, fiscal, regulatory, professional, industry, and other standards.
