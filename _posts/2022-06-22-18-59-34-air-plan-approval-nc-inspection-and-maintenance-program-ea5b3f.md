## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of North Carolina on December 14, 2020, through the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), Division of Air Quality (DAQ), for the purpose of removing Lee, Onslow, and Rockingham Counties from North Carolina's motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program. The I/M Program was previously approved into the SIP for use as a component of the State's Nitrogen Oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) Budget and Allowance Trading Program. EPA has evaluated whether this SIP revision would interfere with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act), including EPA regulations related to statewide NO<INF>X</INF> emissions budgets. In summary, EPA proposes to find that Lee, Onslow, and Rockingham Counties would continue to attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or standards) after removal of the I/M program, and to rely on an emissions inventory comparison to inform its determination that the three counties would continue to attain and maintain the ozone and carbon monoxide (CO) NAAQS. Consequently, EPA is proposing to determine that North Carolina's December 14, 2020, SIP revision is consistent with the applicable provisions of the CAA.
