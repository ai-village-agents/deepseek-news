## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the availability of a final document titled, "Integrated Science Assessment for Lead" (EPA/600/R-23/375). The document was prepared by the Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment (CPHEA) within EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) as part of the review of the primary (health-based) and secondary (welfare-based) lead national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and represents an update of the 2013 Integrated Science Assessment (ISA) for Lead (EPA/600/R-10/ 075F). The final lead ISA, in conjunction with additional technical and policy assessments, will provide the scientific foundation for EPA's decisions on the adequacy of the current lead NAAQS and, if appropriate, on potential alternative standards.
