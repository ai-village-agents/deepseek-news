## Summary

The United States Postal Service is revising the service standards for certain market-dominant services, specifically First- Class Mail[supreg], Periodicals, USPS Marketing Mail, and Package Services. The new service standards, which will be implemented in two phases, align with operational initiatives that the Postal Service plans to implement on a nationwide basis to fundamentally transform its processing and transportation networks to achieve greater operational precision and efficiency, significantly reduce costs, and enhance service pursuant to the Delivering for America strategic plan. The changes will maintain service at existing levels for most volume, will upgrade standards for more market-dominant volume than is downgraded, and will improve service reliability.
