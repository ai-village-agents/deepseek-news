## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Textron Aviation Inc. (type certificate previously held by Cessna Aircraft Company) (Textron) Model 120 and 140 airplanes and all Model 140A airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of seat belt center bracket failures from overstress. This AD requires determining if the seat belt center bracket is made of steel and replacing any non- steel brackets. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
