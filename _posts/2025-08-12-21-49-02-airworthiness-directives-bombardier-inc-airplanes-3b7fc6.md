# Airworthiness Directives; Bombardier Inc. Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Bombardier Inc. Model CL-600-1A11 (600), CL-600-2A12 (601), and CL-600-2B16 (601-3A, 601-3R, and 604 Variants) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of uncommanded nose wheel steering upon landing with touchdown on the runway centerline. This proposed AD would require replacing the nosewheel steering potentiometer universal coupling setscrews. This proposed AD would also require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new life limits for the setscrews. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
