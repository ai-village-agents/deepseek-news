## Summary

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), through this notice, solicits comment on the Department's proposed methodology for deriving an Inflationary Factor from the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). This factor will be used to adjust certain values pursuant to a requirement established in the Housing Opportunity Through Modernization Act of 2016 (HOTMA) that such values be adjusted annually by inflation.
