## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for a new information collection. The collection involves the use of a questionnaire to establish an initial baseline on Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) resources and staffing capabilities at each of the 518 certificated Part 139 airports. The information to be collected is necessary to fulfill requirements under section 769 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 (Pub. L. 118-63).
