## Summary

In accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator's March 18, 2022, memorandum regarding "Consent Decrees and Settlement Agreements to resolve Environmental Claims Against the Agency," notice is hereby given of a proposed settlement in Northwest Environmental Advocates, et al., v. US EPA, No. 1:13-cv-263 (D. Idaho). On September 24, 2013, the Northwest Environmental Advocates and the Idaho Conservation League (collectively "Plaintiffs") filed an amended complaint against the EPA alleging, among other things, that the Agency had failed to complete its mandatory duty under the Clean Water Act ("CWA") to prepare and publish proposed water quality standards for mercury pollution to protect aquatic life following its disapproval of related water quality standard revisions by the State in 2008. On July 19, 2021, the Court issued a ruling concluding that, under the circumstances of this case, EPA's disapproval created a mandatory duty for the Agency to promulgate new criteria for the State. Having ruled against EPA on liability, the Court directed the parties to file briefs regarding an appropriate remedy. EPA seeks public input on a proposed stipulated order on remedy ("Proposed Order") prior to its final decision-making to settle the remedy portion of the litigation.
