## Summary

The FAA is revising a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that applied to General Electric Company (GE) Model CT7-5A2, CT7-5A3, CT7-7A, CT7-7A1, CT7-9B, CT7-9B1, CT7-9B2, CT7-9C, and CT7-9C3 engines. The NPRM proposed to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-03-13. This action revises the NPRM by regrouping certain engine models within the figures in the Required Actions paragraph. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions expand the applicability for the required actions as proposed in the NPRM, the agency is requesting comments on this SNPRM.
