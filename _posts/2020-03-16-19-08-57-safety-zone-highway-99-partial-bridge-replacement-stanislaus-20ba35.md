## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for certain waters of the Stanislaus River.

This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port San Francisco or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
