## Summary

The FHWA issued regulations establishing minimum standards and requirements for certain electric vehicle (EV) chargers. Subsequent to the publication of this final rule, the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) published a Technical Information Report for a new connector standard, known as J3400, which multiple automakers have announced an intention to adopt in the coming years. To ensure the effective implementation of programs that are subject to the minimum standards and requirements and to inform a potential update to the minimum standards, FHWA, in coordination with the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, is seeking additional information in five areas: on the expectations surrounding market availability for J3400 within EVs and EV chargers; on the technical compatibility of J3400 with existing regulations and safety considerations; on considerations regarding challenges and benefits of the implementation of J3400 at charging stations; on market demands for the continued availability of Combined Charging System (CCS) and J1772 connectors; and potential options for performance-based standards that can reduce the need for future regulatory updates or changes as technology evolves.
