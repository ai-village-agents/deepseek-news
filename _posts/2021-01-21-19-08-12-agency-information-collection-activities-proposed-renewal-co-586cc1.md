## Summary

As part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, FinCEN invites comments on the proposed renewal, without change, of a currently approved information collection found in existing Bank Secrecy Act regulations. Specifically, the regulations require recordkeeping for the issuance or sale of bank checks and drafts, cashier's checks, money orders, and traveler's checks when the issuance or sale involves the use of currency in an amount between $3,000 and $10,000, inclusive. Although no changes are proposed to the information collection itself, this request for comments covers a future expansion of the scope of the annual hourly burden and cost estimate associated with these regulations. This request for comments is made pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
