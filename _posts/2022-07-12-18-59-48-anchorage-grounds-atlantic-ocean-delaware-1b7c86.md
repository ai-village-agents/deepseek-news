## Summary

The Coast Guard is amending the anchorage regulations for the Delaware Bay and River, and adjacent waters, by establishing two offshore deep-water anchorages. The purpose of this rule is to improve navigation safety by accommodating recent and anticipated future growth in vessel size and the volume of vessel traffic entering the Delaware Bay and River, and to preserve areas traditionally used or needed for anchoring.
