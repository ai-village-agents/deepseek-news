## Summary

On December 13, 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) requesting comment on the CFPB's proposal to amend Regulation V, which implements the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The proposed rule would implement the FCRA's definitions of consumer report and consumer reporting agency as well as certain of the FCRA's provisions governing when consumer reporting agencies may furnish, and users may obtain, consumer reports. The NPRM provided a comment period that was set to close on March 3, 2025. To allow interested persons more time to consider and submit their comments, the CFPB has determined that an extension of the comment period until April 2, 2025, is appropriate.
