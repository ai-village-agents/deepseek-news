## Summary

DHS proposes to allow asylum officers ("AOs") to consider the potential applicability of certain bars to asylum and statutory withholding of removal during certain fear screenings. Specifically, under this proposed rule, AOs would be authorized to consider certain bars during credible and reasonable fear screenings, including credible fear screenings where the Circumvention of Lawful Pathways ("CLP") rule applies. The proposed rule is intended to enhance operational flexibility and help DHS more swiftly remove certain noncitizens who are barred from asylum and statutory withholding of removal.
