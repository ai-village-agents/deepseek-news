## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) finds that "ringless voicemail" to wireless phones requires consumer consent because it is a "call" made using an artificial or prerecorded voice and thus is covered by of the 1991 Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA). The Commission denies a request from All About the Message, LLC (AATM) to declare that ringless voicemail is not subject to of the TCPA and the Commission's implementing rules. The Commission also denies AATM's alternative request for a retroactive waiver of the Commission's rules.
