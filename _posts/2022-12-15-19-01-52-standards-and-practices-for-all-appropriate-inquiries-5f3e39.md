## Summary

EPA is taking final action to amend the Standards and Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries to reference a standard practice recently made available by ASTM International, a widely recognized standards developing organization. Specifically, this final rule amends the All Appropriate Inquiries Rule (AAI rule) to reference ASTM International's E1527-21 "Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessments: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Process" and allow for its use to satisfy the requirements for conducting all appropriate inquiries under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, and to remove after one year recognition of the previous version of that standard, ASTM E1527-13, as compliant with the AAI rule.
