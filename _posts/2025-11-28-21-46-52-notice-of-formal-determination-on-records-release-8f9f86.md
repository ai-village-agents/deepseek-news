## Summary

The Civil Rights Cold Case Records Review Board received 2,883 pages of records from the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) related to three civil rights cold case incidents to which the Review Board assigned the unique identifiers 2024-003-020, 2024-003-037, and 2024-003-039. The agencies proposed 65 postponements in the records. The FBI later withdrew 17 of the postponements the Bureau proposed after consultation with the Review Board. On September 12 and October 3, 2025, the Review Board approved 22 postponements and portions of 2 additional postponements, and determined that 2,866 pages in full and 17 pages in part should be publicly disclosed in the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection. The Review Board is still coordinating its review of 18 proposed postponements with the agencies because of the sensitive nature of the information. This information is postponed until this coordination is complete and the Review Board can make a final disclosure decision. By issuing this notice, the Review Board complies with the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018 that requires the Review Board to publish in the Federal Register its determinations on the disclosure or postponement of records in the Collection no more than 14 days after the date of its decision.
