## Summary

General Motors (GM) has petitioned NHTSA for a temporary exemption from certain requirements in six Federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSS) for its ADS-equipped vehicle, the "Cruise Origin." Specifically, GM seeks exemption from portions of FMVSS No. 102; Transmission shift position sequence, starter interlock, and transmission braking effect, FMVSS No. 104; Windshield wiping and washing systems, FMVSS No. 108; Lamps, reflective devices, and associated equipment, FMVSS No. 111; Rear visibility, FMVSS No. 201; Occupant protection in interior impact, and FMVSS No. 208; Occupant crash protection. NHTSA is publishing this document in accordance with statutory and administrative provisions and seeks comment on the merits of GM's exemption petition and on potential terms and conditions that should be applied to a temporary exemption if granted. After receiving and considering public comments, NHTSA will assess the merits of the petition and will publish a notice in the Federal notice setting forth NHTSA's reasoning for either granting or denying the petition.
