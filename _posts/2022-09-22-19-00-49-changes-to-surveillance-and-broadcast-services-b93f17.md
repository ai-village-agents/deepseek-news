## Summary

This action announces termination of the Mode-S Traffic Information Service (TIS) at 104 terminal Mode-S radar sites. The FAA is replacing these legacy terminal Mode-S radars via the Mode-S Beacon Replacement System (MSBRS) program, or may remove legacy terminal Mode- S radars as part of other ongoing activities. As each legacy terminal Mode-S Radar is replaced or removed, the FAA will no longer provide Mode-S TIS to capable transponders from that location. This change does not affect existing Traffic Information Service--Broadcast (TIS-B), Automatic Dependent Surveillance--Rebroadcast (ADS-R), or Automatic Dependent Surveillance--Same Link Rebroadcast (ADS-SLR) services currently provided to properly ADS-B equipped aircraft.
