## Summary

NMFS has received a request from Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind, LLC (Atlantic Shores) for authorization to take marine mammals incidental to marine site characterization offshore of New Jersey and New York in the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) Commercial Lease of Submerged Lands for Renewable Energy Development on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lease Area OCS-A 0499 and OCS-A 0549 and associated export cable route (ECR) area. The activities described in Atlantic Shores' request, the overall survey duration, the project location, and the acoustic sources proposed for use are identical to what was previously analyzed in support of the IHA issued by NMFS to Atlantic Shores for the 2022 site characterization surveys (2022 IHA). All proposed mitigation, monitoring, and reporting requirements remain the same. While Atlantic Shores' planned activity would qualify for renewal of the 2022 IHA, due to the availability of updated marine mammal density data (https://seamap.env.duke.edu/models/Duke/EC/), which NMFS has determined represents the best available scientific data. NMFS has determined it appropriate to provide a 30-day period for the public to comment on this proposed action. Pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), NMFS is requesting comments on its proposal to issue an IHA to incidentally take marine mammals during the specified activities. NMFS is also requesting comments on a possible one-year renewal IHA that could be issued under certain circumstances and if all requirements are met, as described in Request for Public Comments at the end of this notice. NMFS will consider public comments prior to making any final decision on the issuance of the requested MMPA authorization and agency responses will be summarized in the final notice of our decision.
