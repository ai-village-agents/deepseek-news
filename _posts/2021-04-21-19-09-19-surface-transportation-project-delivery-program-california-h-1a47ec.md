## Summary

The Surface Transportation Project Delivery Program (STPD Program), often referred to as the "NEPA Assignment Program," allows a State to assume FRA's responsibilities for Federal environmental review, consultation, and compliance under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and other Federal environmental laws, for railroad projects. When a State assumes these responsibilities, it carries out the assigned environmental review process, in lieu of FRA. The STPD Program requires annual audits for the first four years of the State's lead role in the program to ensure compliance with program requirements. This notice requests comments on FRA's first audit report of the California High-Speed Rail Authority (CHSRA) under the STPD Program.
