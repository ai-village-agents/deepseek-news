## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary security zone on the waters of the Lake Worth Lagoon, Intracoastal Waterway, and Atlantic Ocean near the Mar-A-Lago Club and the Southern Boulevard Bridge in Palm Beach, Florida (FL). This rule is substantially like the "east zone" security zone published elsewhere in the Coast Guard's regulations. The Coast Guard will only enforce this rule when the President of the United States, members of the First Family, or other persons under the protection of the Secret Service are present or expected to be present. This action is necessary to protect the official party, public, and surrounding waterways from terrorist acts, sabotage or other subversive acts, accidents, or other events of a similar nature.
