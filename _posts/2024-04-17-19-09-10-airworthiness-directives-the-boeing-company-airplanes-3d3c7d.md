## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, -900 and - 900ER airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of cracks in the forward galley door cutout forward upper corner bear strap. It has been determined that the cracks were caused by high operating stresses in the fuselage skin door cutout corner area due to stress concentration at the door cutout. This AD requires an inspection of the fuselage skin and the bear strap at the forward galley door cutout forward upper corner for existing repairs, and applicable related investigative and corrective actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
