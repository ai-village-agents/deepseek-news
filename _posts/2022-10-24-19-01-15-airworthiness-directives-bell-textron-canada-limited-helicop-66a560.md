## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bell Textron Canada Limited Model 429 helicopters. This AD was prompted by reports of failed rivets between the tailboom skin and the tail rotor (TR) gearbox support assembly. This AD requires visually inspecting the external surface of the TR gearbox support assembly, borescope inspecting or visually inspecting the inside of the tailboom for certain conditions, and performing a tactile inspection. Depending on the results of the inspections, this AD requires removing certain rivets from service or repairing gaps in accordance with an approved method. This AD also requires repeating these inspections within certain intervals. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
