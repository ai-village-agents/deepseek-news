## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH Model MBB-BK 117 C-2, MBB- BK 117 D-2, and MBB-BK 117 D-3 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of damaged hoist hooks and hoist hook nuts. This proposed AD would require performing an inspection of the affected hoist hook and affected hook nut and, depending on the results of the inspection, replacing the affected hoist hook and affected hook nut. This proposed AD would also prohibit installing an affected assembly (hoist hook attached to the hook damper) unless it is installed using updated procedures. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
