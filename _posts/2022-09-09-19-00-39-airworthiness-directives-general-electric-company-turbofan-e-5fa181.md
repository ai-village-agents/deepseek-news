# Airworthiness Directives; General Electric Company Turbofan Engines

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain General Electric Company (GE) GE90-90B, GE90-94B, GE90- 110B1, and GE90-115B model turbofan engines. This proposed AD was prompted by a manufacturer investigation that revealed that certain high-pressure turbine (HPT) stage 1 disks, HPT stage 2 disks, and stages 7-9 compressor rotor spools were manufactured from powder metal material suspected to contain iron inclusion. This proposed AD would require the replacement of the affected HPT stage 1 disks, HPT stage 2 disks, and stages 7-9 compressor rotor spools. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
