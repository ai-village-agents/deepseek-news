## Summary

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as the lead agency, announces its intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the implementation of the plan for National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)--Endangered Species Act (ESA) Integration in Oregon. FEMA released a draft of this plan in October 2021. Notice is hereby given that the public scoping process has begun for the preparation of an EIS for the proposed action. The purpose of the scoping process is to solicit public comments regarding the range of issues, information, and analyses relevant to the proposed action, including potential environmental impacts and reasonable alternatives to address in the EIS. This notice also notifies the public that FEMA intends to host in-person and virtual public scoping meetings, host a web-based scoping room to provide additional information to the public, and solicit comments on potential issues, concerns, and reasonable alternatives that FEMA should consider. FEMA is preparing this EIS in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 and the NEPA regulations implemented by the Council on Environmental Quality as of the date of this Notice.
