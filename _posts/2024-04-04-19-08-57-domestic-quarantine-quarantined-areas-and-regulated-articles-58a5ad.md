# Domestic Quarantine: Quarantined Areas and Regulated Articles; Technical Amendment

## Summary

In a final rule published in the Federal Register on December 29, 2022, and effective on January 30, 2023, we amended the regulations governing domestic quarantines for various plant pests by removing lists of quarantined areas and regulated articles from the regulations in order to maintain these lists on web pages maintained by the Agency. However, in the regulations governing black stem rust, we incorrectly stated that the web page listing articles determined to be rust- resistant only listed species and varieties of the genus Berberis, rather than species and varieties of the genera Berberis, Mahoberberis, and Mahonia. Therefore, we are amending the paragraph to correct the omission.
