## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain British Aerospace (Operations) Limited and British Aerospace Regional Aircraft Model Jetstream Series 200, Jetstream Model 3101, and Jetstream Model 3201 airplanes. This AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as a bent control rod within the gust lock system, which may enable both power levers to be pushed into the flight range with the gust lock lever fully engaged. This AD requires replacing the push rod assembly with a modified push rod assembly. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
