## Summary

NMFS has received a request from US Wind, Inc., (US Wind) for Incidental Take Regulations (ITR) and an associated Letter of Authorization (LOA) pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). The requested regulations would govern the authorization of take, by Level A harassment and Level B harassment, of small number of marine mammals over the course of 5 years (2025-2029) incidental to construction of the Maryland Offshore Wind Project offshore of Maryland within the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) Commercial Lease of Submerged Lands for Renewable Energy Development on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lease Area OCS-A 0490 (Lease Area) and associated Export Cable Routes. Project activities likely to result in incidental take include impact pile driving and site assessment surveys using high-resolution geophysical (HRG) equipment. NMFS requests comments on its proposed rule. NMFS will consider public comments prior to making any final decision on the promulgation of the requested ITR and issuance of the LOA; agency responses to public comments will be summarized in the final notice of our decision. The proposed regulations, if issued, would be effective January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2029.
