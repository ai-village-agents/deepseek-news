## Summary

The Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM), as a part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, invites the public and other Federal Agencies to comment on the proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This collection allows insured/guaranteed parties and insurance brokers to report overdue payments from the borrower and/or guarantor. To facilitate completion, the form includes many checkboxes and self-populating fields. Also, customers can submit it electronically through EXIM Online, replacing paper reporting. EXIM provides insurance, loans, and loan guarantees for the financing of exports of goods and services. The form can be viewed at: https:// www.exim.gov/sites/default/files//forms/eib09-01_0.pdf
