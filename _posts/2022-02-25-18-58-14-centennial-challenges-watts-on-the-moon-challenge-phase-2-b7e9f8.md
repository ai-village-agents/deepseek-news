## Summary

Phase 2 of the Watts on the Moon Challenge is open, and teams that wish to compete may now register. NASA seeks to stimulate research and technology solutions to support future missions and inspire new national aerospace capabilities through public prize competitions called Centennial Challenges. The Watts on the Moon Challenge is one such competition. Centennial Challenges are managed at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama and are part of the Prizes, Challenges, and Crowdsourcing program within NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate at the agency's Headquarters in Washington. Phase 2 of the Watts on the Moon Challenge seeks to attract innovative engineering approaches to integrating power transmission and energy storage in order to enable missions operating in the extreme cold vacuum of the lunar surface. Phase 2 of the Watts on the Moon Challenge is a prize competition with a total prize purse of $4,500,000 USD, (four and a half million United States dollars) to be awarded to competitor teams that build and successfully demonstrate prototypes of novel technologies. Successful demonstrations from this challenge will complement ongoing NASA investments in lunar surface power generation. NASA is funding the prize purse and administration of the challenge competition. Any eligible individual or organization may participate in Phase 2. teams are not required to have participated in Phase 1.
