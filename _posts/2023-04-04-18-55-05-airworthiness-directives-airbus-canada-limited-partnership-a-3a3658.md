## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500- 1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by several unscheduled PW1500G engine removals due to certain crew alerting system (CAS) messages being displayed, high vibration, or debris found on the magnetic chip collector of a bearing compartment. This AD prohibits dispatch of an airplane with an affected engine having an applicable CAS message displayed, unless the bearing compartment chip collector and oil filter are inspected and any debris found is dispositioned, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
