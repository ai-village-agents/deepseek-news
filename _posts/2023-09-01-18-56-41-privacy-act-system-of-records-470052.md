## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC, Commission, or Agency) proposes to modify an existing system of records, FCC/CGB-3, National Deaf-Blind Equipment Distribution Program (NDBEDP), subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. This action is necessary to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act to publish in the Federal Register notice of the existence and character of records maintained by the agency. The Commission uses the information, including personally identifiable information (PII), that is submitted by the certified equipment distribution program in each state, as required by the NDBEDP, to maintain each state's certification to participate in the NDBEDP to support the distribution of specialized customer premises equipment (CPE) and the provision of associated services. State equipment distribution programs, other public programs, and private entities may apply to the Commission for certification for the state to participate in the NDBEDP and receive reimbursement for its activities. This modification makes various necessary changes and updates, including formatting changes required by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-108 since its previous publication, the addition of new routine uses, as well as the revision of existing routine uses.
