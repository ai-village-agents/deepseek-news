## Summary

In accordance with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), EPA is issuing a notice of receipt of and soliciting comments on requests by the registrants to voluntarily cancel their registrations of certain products and/or to amend their product registrations to terminate one or more uses. EPA intends to grant these requests at the close of the comment period for this announcement unless the Agency receives substantive comments within the comment period that would merit further review of the requests, or the registrants withdraw their requests. If these requests are granted, EPA will issue an order in the Federal Register cancelling the listed product registrations, after which any sale, distribution, or use of the products listed in this document will be permitted after the registrations have been cancelled only if such sale, distribution, or use is consistent with the terms as described in the final order. Note that the month and year provided in the title are intended to help distinguish this document from other documents with the same title. This document identifies those requests that were received after the last notice of receipt was issued and are currently under review by EPA.
