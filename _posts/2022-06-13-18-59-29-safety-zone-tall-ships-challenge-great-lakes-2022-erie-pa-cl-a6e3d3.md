## Summary

The Coast Guard will create safety zones around each tall ship visiting the Great Lakes during the Tall Ships Challenge 2022 race series. These safety zones will provide for the regulation of vessel traffic in the vicinity of each tall ship in the navigable waters of the United States. The Coast Guard is taking this action to safeguard participants and spectators from the hazards associated with the limited maneuverability of these tall ships and to ensure public safety during tall ships events.
