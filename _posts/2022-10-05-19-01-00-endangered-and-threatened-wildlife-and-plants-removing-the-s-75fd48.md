## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are removing the snail darter (Percina tanasi), a small freshwater fish native to the Tennessee River watershed, from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife (List). This final rule is based on a thorough review of the best available scientific and commercial information which indicates that the threats to the species have been reduced or eliminated to the point that it has recovered and is no longer in danger of extinction or likely to become in danger of extinction in the foreseeable future. Therefore, the species no longer meets the definition of an endangered or a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act).
