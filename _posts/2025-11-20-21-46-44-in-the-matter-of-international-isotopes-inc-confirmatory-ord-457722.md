## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued a Confirmatory Order to International Isotopes (INIS) to document commitments made as part of a settlement agreement made between the NRC and INIS following an alternative dispute resolution mediation session held on August 6, 2025. The mediation addressed seven apparent violations involving INIS' organization and management of the licensee's broad scope license, control of licensed material, and evaluation of radiation levels. INIS has committed to various measures intended to improve the effectiveness of its Radiation Safety Committee (ALARA Committee), evaluate the range of radiological conditions at its facility during authorized activities, and ensure adequate control of radiological conditions. The Confirmatory Order is effective upon issuance.
