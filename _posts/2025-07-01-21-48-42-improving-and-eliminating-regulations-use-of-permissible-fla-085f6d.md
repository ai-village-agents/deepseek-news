## Summary

MSHA is proposing to revise 30 CFR part 75 by removing flame safety lamps from the list of permissible electric face equipment that can be operated in underground coal mines. This revision would maintain the same level of protection for miners because it removes outdated technology that is no longer used in underground coal mines.
