This action proposes to amend 11 VOR Federal airways, remove 10 VOR Federal airways; amend four low altitude RNAV routes (T-routes), establish seven T-routes; amend one high altitude RNAV route (Q-route), and establish one Q-route. This action would support the Northeast Corridor Atlantic Coast Route Project and the VOR Minimum Operational Network (VOR MON) Program to improve the efficiency of the National Airspace System (NAS) and reduce dependency on ground-based navigational systems.
