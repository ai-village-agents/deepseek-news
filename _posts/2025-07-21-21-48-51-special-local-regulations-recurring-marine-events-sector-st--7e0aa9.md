## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to revise its existing special local regulations by adding a new recurring event to an existing table. The Coast Guard is also proposing to expand a regulated area for one event and update the dates of existing events in the Seventh Coast Guard District Captain of the Port (COTP) St. Petersburg. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
