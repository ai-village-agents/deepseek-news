## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to list the Quitobaquito tryonia (Tryonia quitobaquitae), a springsnail species from Arizona, as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). This determination also serves as our 12-month finding on a petition to list the Quitobaquito tryonia. After a review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that listing the species is warranted. We also propose to designate critical habitat for the Quitobaquito tryonia under the Act. In total, approximately 6,095 square feet (566 square meters) across 2 subunits in Pima County, Arizona, fall within the boundaries of the proposed critical habitat designation. We also announce the availability of a draft economic analysis (DEA) of the proposed designation of critical habitat for Quitobaquito tryonia. If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would extend the Act's protections to this species and its designated critical habitat.
