## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA, the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) on October 13, 2016. The revision was submitted in response to a finding of substantial inadequacy and SIP call as published by EPA on June 12, 2015, concerning excess emissions during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) events. EPA is approving the SIP revision and finds that such revision corrects the inadequacies identified in New Mexico's SIP in the June 12, 2015 SIP call.
