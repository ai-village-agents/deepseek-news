## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing a new Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.246, "Acceptability of ASME Code, Section XI, Division 2, `Requirements for Reliability and Integrity Management (RIM) Programs for Nuclear Power Plants,' for Non-Light Water Reactors." This RG describes an approach that is acceptable to the NRC staff for the development and implementation of a preservice inspection (PSI) and inservice inspection (ISI) program for non-light water reactors (non-LWRs). It endorses, with conditions, the 2019 Edition of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (ASME Code), Section XI, "Rules for Inservice Inspection of Nuclear Power Plant Components," Division 2, for non-LWR applications. This RG also describes a method that applicants can use to incorporate PSI and ISI programs into a licensing basis.
