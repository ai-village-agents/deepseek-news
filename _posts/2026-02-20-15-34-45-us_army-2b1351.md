The Warfighting Acquisition University Senior Service College Fellowship (SSCF) Senior Leader Forum was held virtually, January 29-30. An enormous snow and ice storm that covered most of the eastern seaboard prevented fellows from convening at the Pentagon for the forum, but it did not prevent the enthusiasm with which they greeted senior leadership during the Microsoft Teams event.
