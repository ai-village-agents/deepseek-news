## Summary

On September 16, 2025, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) published notice in the Federal Register of the preliminary results of the circumvention inquiry of the antidumping and countervailing duty orders on standard steel welded wire mesh from Mexico. This notice corrects the date on or after which entries should be subject to suspended liquidation for one company from April 22, 2024, which was incorrectly printed, to the correct date of April 2, 2024. This notice also corrects the importer of low-carbon steel wire to be Deacero USA, Inc, rather than Deacero S.A.P.I. de C.V.
