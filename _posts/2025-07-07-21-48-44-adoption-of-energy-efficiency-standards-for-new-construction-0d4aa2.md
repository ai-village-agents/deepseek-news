## Summary

HUD and USDA ("the agencies") published a Final Determination on April 26, 2024, adopting the 2021 IECC and ASHRAE 90.1-2019 energy codes as minimum requirements for programs covered under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). The Final Determination found that adoption of the energy codes would have no negative impact on the affordability and availability of EISA- covered housing. The agencies plan to review the analysis contained in the Final Determination and are seeking public comments to inform the review.
