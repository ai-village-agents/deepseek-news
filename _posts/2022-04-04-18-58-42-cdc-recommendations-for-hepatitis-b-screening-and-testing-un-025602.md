## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), located within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), announces the opening of a docket to obtain comment on proposed updated recommendations for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection screening and testing (Proposed Updated Recommendations), including hepatitis B screening at least once in a lifetime for persons 18 years of age and older, using a three-test panel. The Proposed Updated Recommendations also expand existing risk-based testing recommendations to include the following populations, activities, exposures, or conditions associated with increased risk for HBV infection: Persons currently or formerly incarcerated in a jail, prison, or other detention setting; persons with a history of sexually transmitted infections or multiple sex partners; and persons with a history of hepatitis C virus infection. The Proposed Updated Recommendations are intended to inform the practices of and care by U.S. healthcare providers and are based on scientific evidence of the effectiveness and economic value of screening to diagnose current HBV infection among adults in the United States.
