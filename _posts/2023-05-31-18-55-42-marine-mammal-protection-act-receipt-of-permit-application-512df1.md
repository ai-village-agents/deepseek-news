## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), invite the public to comment on an application to conduct certain activities with marine mammals for which the Service has jurisdiction under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). With some exceptions, the MMPA prohibits activities with marine mammals unless Federal authorization is issued that allows such activities. The MMPA also requires that we invite public comment before issuing permits for any activity that is otherwise prohibited with respect to any marine mammal.
