## Summary

This rule amends HUD's regulations covering rental housing assistance for the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant (NHHBG) program, consistent with the Native American Housing Assistance and Self- Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA). The amendments clarify and improve consistency with NAHASDA's statutory requirements and HUD's Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) program regulations. This rule would also help to make affordable housing opportunities, in the form of NHHBG- assisted rental housing, more available to eligible Native Hawaiian families.
