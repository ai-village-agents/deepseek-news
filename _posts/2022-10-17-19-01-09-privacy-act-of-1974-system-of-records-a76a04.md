## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to modify and reissue a current DHS system of records titled, "Department of Homeland Security/Federal Emergency Management Agency-011 Training and Exercise Program Records System of Records." This system of records allows DHS/Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to collect from and maintain records on current and former FEMA employees and contractors, current and former members of the first responder and emergency management communities, and other individuals who have applied or registered to participate in training and exercise programs or who have assisted with FEMA's training and exercise programs. DHS/FEMA is updating this system of records notice (SORN) to include: (1) Modifying system location; (2) supplementing legal authorities; (3) clarifying the purpose of the SORN; (4) expanding the categories of records; (5) clarifying the sources of records; (6) revising the routine uses; and (7) adjusting the retention and disposal schedule of records. Additionally, this notice includes non-substantive changes to simplify the formatting and text of the previously published notice. This updated system will be included in DHS's inventory of record systems.
