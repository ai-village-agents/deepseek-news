## Summary

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) proposes to revise its regulations governing site security and production handling and commingling applications to reflect Congress's direction in section 50101(d)(3) of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" (OBBB) and policy direction in Executive Orders (E.O.s) entitled, Unleashing American Energy and Ensuring Lawful Governance and Implementing the President's "Department of Government Efficiency" Deregulatory Initiative and policy guidance in Secretary's Order (S.O.) 3418, entitled, Unleashing American Energy. The BLM is proposing to revise the regulations to allow for commingling of production more broadly to promote oil and gas production on Federal, Indian, private and State lands. Commingling of production can reduce an operator's cost which could extend the economic life of a well, thereby allowing the operator to continue producing from a well that might otherwise be abandoned.
