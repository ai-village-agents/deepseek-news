## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to revise regulations issued under section 4(e) of the Endangered Species Act (Act) related to furthering the conservation of the following listed endangered species and threatened species: Pearl River map turtle (Graptemys pearlensis), bog turtle (northern distinct population segment [DPS]) (Glyptemys muhlenbergii), Miami blue butterfly (Cyclargus thomasi bethunebakeri), Desert tortoise (Mojave DPS) (Gopherus agassizii), Florida panther (Puma (=Felis) concolor coryi), and pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus). We propose to amend or remove regulations concerning taking or commerce in the following 11 similarity of appearance species: Alabama map turtle (Graptemys pulchra), Barbour's map turtle (Graptemys barbouri), Escambia map turtle (Graptemys ernsti), Pascagoula map turtle (Graptemys gibbonsi), bog turtle (southern DPS), cassius blue butterfly (Leptotes cassius theonus), ceraunus blue butterfly (Hemiargus ceraunus antibubastus), nickerbean blue butterfly (Cyclargus ammon), desert tortoise (Sonoran population), puma (=mountain lion) (Puma (=Felis) concolor (all subspecies except coryi)), and shovelnose sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus platorynchus). We are proposing these changes to eliminate unnecessary regulations and to ensure that species treated as endangered or threatened under section 4(e) of the Act meet the three required criteria as directed in section 4(e) of the Act.
