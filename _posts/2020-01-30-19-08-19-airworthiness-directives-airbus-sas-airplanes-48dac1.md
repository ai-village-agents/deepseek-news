## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -113, - 114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, - 211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. This AD was prompted by the absence of a requirement to remove a certain Emergency Procedure in the existing Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) after accomplishing a certain modification or replacement. This AD requires, for airplanes on which a certain modification or replacement is done, revising the AFM by removing a certain Emergency Procedure in the AFM, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
