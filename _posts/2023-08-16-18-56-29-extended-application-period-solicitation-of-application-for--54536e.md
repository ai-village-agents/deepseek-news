## Summary

On July 25, 2023, the Maritime Administration (MARAD) published a notice in the Federal Register providing how to apply to MARAD's Tanker Security Program (TSP). By this follow-on notice, MARAD is extending the application period for eligible candidates for one TSP Operating Agreement and is republishing the same information soliciting applications. The FY21 NDAA authorized the Secretary of Transportation to establish a fleet of active, commercially viable, militarily useful, privately owned product tank vessels of the United States. The fleet will meet national defense and other security requirements and maintain a United States presence in international commercial shipping. The FY22 NDAA made minor adjustments related to the participation of long-term charters in the TSP. This request for applications provides, among other things, application criteria and a deadline for submitting applications for the enrollment of one vessel in the TSP.
