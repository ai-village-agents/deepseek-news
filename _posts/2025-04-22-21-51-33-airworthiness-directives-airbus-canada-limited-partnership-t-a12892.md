## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a design review of aircraft structural and stress reports that resulted in a revision of operational loads for some aircraft flight phases. This AD requires a review and disposition of all existing repairs and damage assessments for affected structure, corrective actions if necessary, and the prohibition of certain repair engineering orders (REOs), as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
