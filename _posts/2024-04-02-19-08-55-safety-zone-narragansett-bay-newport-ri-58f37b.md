## Summary

This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters near East Passage, Narragansett Bay, RI, during a sailboat race. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Sector Southeastern New England or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
