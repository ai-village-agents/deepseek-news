## Summary

In accordance with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Final Programmatic Damage Assessment Restoration Plan and Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (Final PDARP/PEIS), Record of Decision and the Consent Decree, the Federal and State natural resource trustee agencies for the Louisiana Trustee Implementation Group (LA TIG) have prepared the Draft Phase 2 Restoration Plan/Environmental Assessment #7.1: Terrebonne HNC Island Restoration Project (RP/EA #7.1). RP/EA #7.1 proposes design alternatives for construction of one project to help restore bird species injured in the Louisiana Restoration Area as a result of the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill: the Terrebonne HNC Restoration Project (HNC Island project). The project was approved for engineering and design (E&D) in a 2020 restoration plan entitled Louisiana Trustee Implementation Group Final Restoration Plan #7: Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats and Birds (RP/EA #7). RP/EA #7.1 analyzes a reasonable range of design alternatives for the project and proposes a preferred design alternative, HNC design alternative 7A, for construction. A No Action alternative is also analyzed for the project. We invite comments on the Draft RP/EA #7.1.
