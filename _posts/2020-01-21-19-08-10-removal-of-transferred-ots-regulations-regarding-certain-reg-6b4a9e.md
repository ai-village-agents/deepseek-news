## Summary

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is adopting a final rule (final rule) to rescind and remove certain regulations transferred in 2011 to the FDIC from the former Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) because they are unnecessary, redundant, or duplicative of other regulations or safety and soundness considerations. In addition to the removal, the FDIC is making technical changes to other parts of the FDIC's regulations so that they may be applicable on their terms to State savings associations. Following the removal of the identified regulations, the regulations governing the operations of State savings associations will be substantially the same as those for all other FDIC-supervised institutions.
