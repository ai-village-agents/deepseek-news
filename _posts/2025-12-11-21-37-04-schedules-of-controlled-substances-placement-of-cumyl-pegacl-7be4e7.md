## Summary

The Drug Enforcement Administration proposes placing the substance CUMYL-PEGACLONE (SGT-151; 5-pentyl-2-(2-phenylpropan-2- yl)pyrido[4,3-b]indol-1-one), including its salts, isomers (including optical, positional, and geometric isomers), and salts of isomers, in schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. CUMYL-PEGACLONE was temporarily scheduled in an order dated December 12, 2023. This action is being taken, in part, to enable the United States to meet its obligations under the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. If finalized, this action would make permanent the existing regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions applicable to schedule I controlled substances on persons who handle (manufacture, distribute, reverse distribute, import, export, engage in research, conduct instructional activities or chemical analysis with, or possess) or propose to handle CUMYL-PEGACLONE.
