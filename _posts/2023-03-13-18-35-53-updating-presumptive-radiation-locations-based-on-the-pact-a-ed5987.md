## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is issuing this final rule to amend its adjudication regulations to add more presumptive exposure locations for radiation, as legislated in the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (the PACT Act). The PACT Act expands and extends eligibility for VA benefits for Veterans with toxic exposures, and Sections 401 and 402 specifically ease the evidentiary burden for Veterans who file claims with VA based on radiation exposure in certain locations. This final rule chronicles those sections of the PACT Act in VA regulations.
