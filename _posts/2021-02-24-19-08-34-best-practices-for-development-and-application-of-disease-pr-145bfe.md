## Summary

One of the goals of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 2017 (PDUFA VI), part of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (FDARA), is advancing model-informed drug development (MIDD). The "Best Practices for Development and Application of Disease Progression Models" workshop fulfills FDA's performance commitment under PDUFA VI to hold a workshop. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is opening a docket to solicit public input on topics areas for an upcoming disease progression modeling workshop. The purpose of this public workshop is to discuss the best practices for developing disease progression models and their application to support drug development decisions; share experiences and case studies that highlight the opportunities and limitations in the development and application of disease progression models including models for natural history of disease and clinical trial simulations; and discuss the knowledge gaps and research needed to advance the development and use of disease progression models.
