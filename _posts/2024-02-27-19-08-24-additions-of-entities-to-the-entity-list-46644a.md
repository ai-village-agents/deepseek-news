## Summary

In this rule, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by adding 93 entities under 95 entries to the Entity List. These entries are listed on the Entity List under the destinations of the People's Republic of China (China) (8), India (1), Kyrgyzstan (2), Russia (63), South Korea (1), Turkey (16), and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) (4). Two entities are added to the Entity List under two destinations, accounting for the difference in the totals. These entities have been determined by the U.S. Government to be acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.
