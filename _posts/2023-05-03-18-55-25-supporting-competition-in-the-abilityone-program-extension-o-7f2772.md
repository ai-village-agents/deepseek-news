## Summary

On March 13, 2023, the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (Committee), operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission (Commission), published a proposed rule, Supporting Competition in the AbilityOne Program, with a 60-day comment period ending on May 11, 2023. The Commission has determined that a 30- day extension of the comment period, until June 12, 2023, is appropriate. The Commission is taking this action in response to requests for an extension to allow interested persons additional time to submit comments.
