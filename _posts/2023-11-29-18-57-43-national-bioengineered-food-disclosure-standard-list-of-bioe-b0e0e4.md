## Summary

This final rule updates the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard's (the Standard) List of Bioengineered (BE) Foods (the List) by adding "sugarcane (Bt insect-resistant varieties)" to the List and amending "squash (summer)" to "squash (summer, coat protein-mediated virus-resistant varieties)." In updating the List, this final rule provides consumers with information regarding foods that may be BE and aids regulated entities in determining whether they need to make a BE disclosure.
