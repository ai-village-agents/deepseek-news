## Summary

In July 2021, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) completed the Paraquat Dichloride Interim Registration Review Decision (Paraquat ID). The Paraquat ID finalized certain portions of EPA's analysis of paraquat's risks and benefits and determined that certain mitigation measures were necessary for paraquat to meet the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) standard for registration. In September 2021, the California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation, et al. (Petitioners) filed a Petition for Review of the Paraquat ID in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. As part of that litigation, EPA has further considered several substantive issues raised by the Petitioners in relation to the Paraquat ID, including concerns related to human health and EPA's balancing of risks and benefits. This document announces the availability of and solicits public comment on a document that presents EPA's preliminary reconsideration of the issues raised by Petitioners in relation to the Paraquat ID.
