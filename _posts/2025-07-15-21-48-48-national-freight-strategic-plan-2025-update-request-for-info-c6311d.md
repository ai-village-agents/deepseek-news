## Summary

The safe and efficient movement of freight is vital to the Nation's economic growth and to the creation of well-paying jobs for millions of Americans. In 2020, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) published a National Freight Strategic Plan (NFSP). 49 U.S.C. 70102 requires the DOT to update the NFSP based on 17 components to address multimodal freight transportation. DOT seeks information from the public, including stakeholders (e.g., State, metropolitan planning organization, and local agencies, port authorities, private owners and operators, industry trade groups, shippers, and beneficial cargo owners) to aid development of the updated NFSP.
