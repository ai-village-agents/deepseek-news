## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission or FCC) adopts several rule updates for full power and Class A television stations that no longer have any practical effect given the completion of the transition from analog to digital-only operations and the post incentive auction transition to a smaller television band with fewer channels. The Commission also adopts a restructuring of its full power television rules, which largely consist of the technical licensing, operating, and interference rules for full power television.
