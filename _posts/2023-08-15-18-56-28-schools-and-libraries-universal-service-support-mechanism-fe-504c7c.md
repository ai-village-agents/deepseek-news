## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) take steps to increase Tribal library eligibility and continue to reduce administrative burdens in the program. In doing so, the Commission expects to make the program more accessible to Tribal communities, so that they can leverage E-Rate funds to improve and meet the broadband connectivity needs of their communities. Where appropriate, the Commission also amends its rules to benefit non-Tribal applicants as well, to simplify and streamline the E-Rate program for all participants. The Commission expects that these measures will provide a meaningful difference for Tribal communities, especially Tribal libraries that seek to participate in the E-Rate program.
