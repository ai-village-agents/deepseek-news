## Summary

This provides notice of the establishment of the matching program between the U.S. Department of Education (Department) and the Department of Defense (DoD), which sets forth the terms, safeguards, and procedures under which the DoD will disclose data to the Department on service members deployed to areas that qualify for imminent danger pay (IDP) or hostile fire pay (HFP) as described in Defense Manpower Data Center Base (DMDC 01) System of Records Notice, routine use 15.b. This matching program will enable the Department to provide no-interest accrual benefits on qualifying loans made under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA) during the time those service members were deployed to qualifying locations.
