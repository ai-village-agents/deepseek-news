## Summary

This final rule will clarify a regulation adopted under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA), which cross-references and incorrectly interprets regulations adopted under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act. The Monitor National Marine Sanctuary (Sanctuary) regulations currently prohibit some, but not all, fishing in the Sanctuary. NMFS is clarifying its regulation which incorrectly interprets Sanctuary regulations to prohibit all fishing in the Sanctuary by removing the fishing prohibition text and cross- referencing regulations for national marine sanctuaries.
