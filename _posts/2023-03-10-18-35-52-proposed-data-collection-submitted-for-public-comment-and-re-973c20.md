## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of Government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled STD Surveillance Network (SSuN). This information collection request is designed to strengthen national and local surveillance capacity for incident, new and emerging sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) by collecting relevant risk, demographic, and clinical information on patients at risk for STDs attending STD-related healthcare facilities, and providing more accurate estimates of the burden of disease, incidence of STDs, trends and impact of STDs at the population level.
