## Summary

Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has determined to review in part a final initial determination ("Final ID") issued by the presiding administrative law judge ("ALJ") finding no violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, with respect to U.S. Patent Nos. 9,264,370 ("the '370 patent"); 10,193,917 ("the '917 patent"); and 10,284,526 ("the '526 patent"). On review, the Commission has determined to take no position regarding whether the economic prong of the domestic industry requirement is satisfied, and to affirm under modified reasoning the Final ID's finding of no violation of section 337 with respect to those patents. This investigation is terminated.
