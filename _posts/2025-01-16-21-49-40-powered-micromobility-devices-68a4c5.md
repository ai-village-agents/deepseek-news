## Summary

The National Park Service proposes a management framework for the use of powered micromobility devices within the National Park System. The proposed rule would define powered micromobility devices separately from motor vehicles, traditional bicycles, electric bicycles, and human powered coasting devices, and create rules for where and how they may be used in units of the National Park System. Examples of powered micromobility devices include electric scooters (e- scooters), hoverboards, and Segways.
