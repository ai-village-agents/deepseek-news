## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is requesting comment on a regulatory basis to support a rulemaking that would amend its regulations for nonemergency event notifications. The NRC is evaluating the current requirements and guidance for immediate notification of nonemergency events for operating nuclear power reactors and assessing whether the requirements present an unnecessary reporting burden. The regulatory basis contains an analysis of whether reporting requirements can be reduced or eliminated when they do not have a commensurate safety benefit.
