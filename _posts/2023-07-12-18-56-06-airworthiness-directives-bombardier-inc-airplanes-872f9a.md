## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-06- 13, which applied to all Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-2A12 airplanes. AD 2023-06-13 required revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) with new limitations to mitigate identified hazards due to interference from wireless broadband operations in the 3.7-3.98 GHz frequency band (5G C-Band) as identified by Notices to Air Missions (NOTAMs). Since the FAA issued AD 2023-06-13, the FAA determined that additional limitations are needed due to the continued deployment of new 5G C-Band stations whose signals are expected to cover most of the contiguous United States at transmission frequencies between 3.7-3.98 GHz. This AD requires revising the limitations section of the existing AFM to incorporate limitations prohibiting dispatch under certain master minimum equipment list (MMEL) items. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
