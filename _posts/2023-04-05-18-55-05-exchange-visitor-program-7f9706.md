## Summary

In accordance with the General Provisions of the Exchange Visitor Program regulations, the Department's Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs waives and modifies certain regulatory requirements with respect to a temporary educational and cultural exchange program established pursuant to an arrangement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Ukraine. This arrangement allows the Department to extend Special Student Relief to eligible Ukrainian students in the United States on J-1 visas to help mitigate the adverse impact on them resulting from the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine that began on February 24, 2022.
