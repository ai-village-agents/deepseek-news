## Summary

The Consumer Product Safety Commission is withdrawing its proposed rule to amend its regulations to require disclosure of relevant interests by persons seeking to make oral presentations, participate in adjudicative proceedings, or submit petitions for rulemaking to the Commission because the Commission has not taken any action on this proposed rule since it was published in September 2023.
