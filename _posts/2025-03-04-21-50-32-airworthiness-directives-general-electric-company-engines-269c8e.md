## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain General Electric Company (GE) Model CT7-5A2, CT7-5A3, CT7-7A, CT7-7A1, CT7-9B, CT7-9B1, CT7-9B2, CT7-9C, CT7-9C3, CT7-9D, and CT7-9D2 engines. This AD was prompted by the manufacturer's determination that certain GE Model CT7 fleets have affected cooling plates installed that do not meet lifing guidelines. This AD requires replacement of the stage 1 turbine forward cooling plate and the stage 2 turbine aft cooling plate. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
