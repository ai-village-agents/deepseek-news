## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on March 25, 2025. The collection determines whether licensees have complied with financial responsibility requirements for maximum probable loss determination (MPL) analysis as set forth in FAA regulations. The information to be collected will be used to cover claims by a third party for bodily injury or property damage, and the United States, its agencies, and its contractors and subcontractors for covered property damage or loss, resulting from a Commercial space transportation permitted or licensed activity and/or is necessary because it fulfills a statutory requirement.
