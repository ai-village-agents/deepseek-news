## Summary

The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), USDA, published a document in the Federal Register of February 11, 2020, announcing a public hearing to receive evidence on proposed amendments to Federal Marketing Order No. 984 (Order) regulating the handling of walnuts grown in California. The California Walnut Board (Board), which locally administers the Order, recommended proposed amendments that would add authority for the Board to provide credit for certain market promotion expenses paid by handlers against their annual assessments due under the Order and establish requirements to effectuate the new authority. In addition, AMS proposed to make changes to the Order as may be necessary to conform to any amendment that may result from the hearing. The date and method of the hearing have changed.
