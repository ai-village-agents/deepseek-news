## Summary

The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention is updating its meeting notice, published on December 20, 2019, because it has re-scheduled the meeting of the Federal Advisory Committee on Juvenile Justice (FACJJ), that had been scheduled for January 7, 2020, but was postponed due to inclement weather causing early closure of Washington, DC-area federal offices on the scheduled meeting date.
