## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the State of Missouri submitted by the State on October 25, 2019. The revisions will amend the SIP by providing a more efficient way to perform emissions sampling on air pollution sources throughout Missouri. The State requested approval of incorporating by reference the federally defined methods for stack testing. These revisions are administrative in nature and do not affect the stringency of the SIP. The EPA's approval of this rule revision is being done in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
