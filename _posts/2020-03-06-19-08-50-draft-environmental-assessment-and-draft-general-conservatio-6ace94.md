## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce the availability of a draft General Conservation Plan (GCP), as well as the associated draft environmental assessment (EA), for oil and gas activities in Santa Barbara County. The Service developed the GCP in accordance with the Endangered Species Act to provide a streamlined mechanism for proponents engaged in oil and gas activities to meet statutory and regulatory requirements while promoting conservation of the Santa Barbara County distinct population segment of the California tiger salamander, California red-legged frog, and Lompoc yerba santa. The Service prepared the draft EA in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act to evaluate the potential effects to the natural and human environment resulting from issuing permits under the GCP. We invite public comment on these documents.
