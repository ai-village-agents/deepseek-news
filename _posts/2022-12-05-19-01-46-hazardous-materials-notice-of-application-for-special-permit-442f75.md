## Summary

PHMSA is publishing this notice to provide awareness and solicit comments on an application for a special permit currently under review by PHMSA in consultation with the Federal Railroad Administration. An applicant is seeking a special permit to authorize the transportation in commerce of cryogenic ethane in DOT-113C120W9 and DOT-113C120W tank cars via rail freight. PHMSA notes that the subject matter of the special permit--i.e., transportation of cryogenic flammable liquids in rail tank cars--raises issues similar to the transportation of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) by rail, a matter for which multiple rulemakings are currently pending at the agency. Therefore, PHMSA is providing an opportunity for public comment on the application.
