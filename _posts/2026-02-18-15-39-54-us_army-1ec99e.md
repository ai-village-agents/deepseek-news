At the front of the U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory’s lecture room is the USAARL Wall of Honor, a place of distinction and prominence. Since USAARL began operation in 1962, only 12 individuals have made such an enduring contribution to warrant having a plaque with their name placed on the wall. Recently, a 13th plaque was added to recognize retired U.S. Army Col. Dennis Shanahan, a military aeromedical researcher and former USAARL commander.
