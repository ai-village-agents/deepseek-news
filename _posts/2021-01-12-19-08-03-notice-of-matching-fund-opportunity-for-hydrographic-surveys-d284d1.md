## Summary

This notice establishes selection criteria and requirements for the NOAA National Ocean Service Office of Coast Survey's (Coast Survey) Hydrographic Surveying Matching Fund opportunity pilot program (pilot program). The purpose of this notice is to encourage non-Federal entities to partner with NOAA on jointly funded hydrographic surveying and mapping and related activities of mutual interest. NOAA would match partner funds and rely on its existing contract arrangements to conduct the actual surveying and mapping activities. NOAA is requesting that interested entities submit proposals by February 26, 2021. The goal of the pilot program is to acquire more ocean and coastal hydrographic surveying for mutual benefit, including for safe navigation, integrated ocean and coastal mapping, coastal zone management, coastal and ocean science, and other activities. The program relies on NOAA's hydrographic expertise, appropriated funds, and its authority to receive and expend matching funds contributed by partners to conduct surveying and mapping activities. This pilot program is subject to funding availability.
