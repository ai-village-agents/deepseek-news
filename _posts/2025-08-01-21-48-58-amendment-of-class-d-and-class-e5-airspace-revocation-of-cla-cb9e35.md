## Summary

This action amends the Class D airspace at Dover Air Force Base (AFB) due to the currently designated airspace not properly containing instrument flight rule (IFR) operations. Additionally, this action establishes Class E surface airspace and revokes the Class E surface extension airspace extending upward from the surface above Dover AFB, Dover, DE, due to the airspace no longer meeting the specifications of its current designation. This action also amends the boundaries of Class E airspace extending upward from 700 ft that no longer meets the requirements for its specific designation due to the amendment or cancellation of Standard Instrument Approach Procedures. This action also updates the coordinates for Dover AFB, Dover, DE, Delaware Airpark, Dover, DE, and the Dover TACAN.
