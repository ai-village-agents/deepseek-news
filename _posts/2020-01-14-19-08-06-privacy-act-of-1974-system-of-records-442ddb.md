## Summary

The OUSD(C) is modifying an existing System of Records titled, "Forms and Account Management Service (FAMS)," DCFO 01. FAMS will be the sole, web-based platform for the appointment and termination of Department Accountable Officials, appointment and termination of Key Signatories of financial documentation, and access management to a portfolio of information systems. During Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) audits of Department of Defense (DoD) Information Technology (IT) processes, numerous notices of findings and recommendations were issued related to vulnerabilities in managing Defense systems account access and appointment of accountable official positions. Findings identified gaps in properly handling and managing accounts for access and authority to act. Improper account management presents information security risks that could result in unauthorized access. Historically, many of these functions were performed in a decentralized manner and conducted manually without effective checks and balances on accuracy. Introduction of the new web-based platform will reduce and eliminate the use of paper forms as it will automate the request and approval processes and enable periodic validation and reconciliation of account records against actual account permissions.
