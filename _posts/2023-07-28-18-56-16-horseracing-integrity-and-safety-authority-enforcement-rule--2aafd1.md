## Summary

The Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act of 2020 recognizes a self-regulatory nonprofit organization, the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority, which is charged with developing proposed rules on a variety of subjects. Those proposed rules and proposed rule modifications take effect only if approved by the Federal Trade Commission. The Authority submitted to the Commission a proposed rule modification on Enforcement on May 31, 2023. The Office of the Secretary of the Commission determined that the proposal complied with the Commission's rule governing such submissions. This document publicizes the Authority's proposed rule modification's text and explanation, and it seeks public comment on whether the Commission should approve or disapprove the proposed rule modification.
