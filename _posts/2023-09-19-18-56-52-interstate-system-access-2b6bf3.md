## Summary

FHWA proposes and requests comments on regulations governing changes in access to the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways (Interstate System). As a condition of funding for Federal-aid highway projects, Federal law prohibits State departments of transportation (State DOT) from adding any point of access to or from the Interstate System without the approval of the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary). This proposed rule would codify and clarify existing policies and practices regarding State DOT requests for and FHWA approval of changes in access to the Interstate System.
