## Summary

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing final regulations governing probation on initial appointment to a competitive position, performance-based reduction in grade and removal actions, and adverse actions. The final rule rescinds certain regulatory changes made effective on November 16, 2020, and implements new statutory requirements for Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) procedural and appeal rights for dual status National Guard technicians for certain adverse actions. OPM believes the final revisions will support implementation of an Executive order to empower agencies to rebuild the career Federal workforce and protect the civil service rights of their employees, while preserving appropriate mechanisms for pursuing personnel actions where warranted.
