## Summary

An open meeting of the Taxpayer Advocacy Panel's Tax Forms and Publications Project Committee will be conducted. The Taxpayer Advocacy Panel is soliciting public comments, ideas, and suggestions on improving customer service at the Internal Revenue Service. Due to unavoidable delays in this year's approval process, we will not be able to meet the 15-calendar notice threshold, but this meeting will still be open. This meeting will still be held via teleconference.
