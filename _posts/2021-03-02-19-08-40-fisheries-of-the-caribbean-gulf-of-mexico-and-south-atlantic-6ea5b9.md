## Summary

NMFS proposes to implement management measures described in a framework action to the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico (Reef Fish FMP), as prepared and submitted by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council). This proposed rule would prohibit certain fishing activities and, with one exception, the possession of Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) reef fish within the Madison-Swanson and Steamboat Lumps Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). The purpose of this proposed rule and the framework action is to protect spawning aggregations of mature reef fish species by reducing the potential for illegal fishing activities within these MPAs.
