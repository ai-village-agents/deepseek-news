## Summary

This action corrects an error in a table posted in the June 9, 2022, rule redesignating the Ohio portion of the Cincinnati, Ohio- Kentucky area to attainment of the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). The table contained motor vehicle emissions budgets (Budgets) for volatile organic compounds (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) for the Ohio portion of the Cincinnati OH-KY area. The Budgets table in that action conflicts with the Budgets submitted by Ohio and set forth in the proposed rule. Therefore, EPA is correcting the erroneous table.
