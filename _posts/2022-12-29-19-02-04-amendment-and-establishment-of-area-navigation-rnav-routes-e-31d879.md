**Published:** February 05, 2026 19:02 UTC

**Document Number:** 2022-28361

## Summary

This action corrects a final rule published by the FAA in the Federal Register on December 12, 2022 that amends three area navigation (RNAV) routes (T-routes), and establishes five T-routes. In the final rule, the HITMN, TN, waypoint (WP), the TMPSN, TN, WP, and the TROPP, SC, WP were misspelled, and the PENCE, TN, point was misidentified as a WP instead of a Fix. The action makes editorial corrections to the above points to match the FAA National Airspace System Resource (NASR) database information.
