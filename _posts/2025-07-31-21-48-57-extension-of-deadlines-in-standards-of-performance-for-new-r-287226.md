## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking interim final action to extend certain deadlines within the final rule titled "Standards of Performance for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources and Emissions Guidelines for Existing Sources: Oil and Natural Gas Sector Climate Review," 89 FR 16820 (March 8, 2024) (hereafter "2024 final rule"). Specifically, the EPA is extending deadlines for certain provisions related to control devices, equipment leaks, storage vessels, process controllers, and covers/closed vent systems in "Subpart OOOOb--Standards of Performance for Crude Oil and Natural Gas Facilities for Which Construction, Modification or Reconstruction Commenced After December 6, 2022" (NSPS OOOOb). The EPA also is extending the date for future implementation of the SuperEmitter Program. Finally, the EPA is extending the state plan submittal deadline in "Subpart OOOOc--Emissions Guidelines (EG) for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From Existing Crude Oil and Natural Gas Facilities" (EG OOOOc). The EPA is requesting comments on all aspects of this interim final rule and will consider all comments received in determining whether amendments to this rule are appropriate after the conclusion of the comment period.
