## Summary

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) requests public comment on an exemption application to allow K & L Trucking (K & L) to transport metal coils using a single two-ply nylon- Kevlar tie down strap to secure its metal coils for transport to a metal coil carrier affixed to the bed of its trucks/trailers as an alternative to the requirements in current regulations. K & L states that its method of securing steel coils is a safe alternative to the method required in the FMCSRs for the short distance that each load is transported. K & L believes the exemption would maintain a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level of safety achieved without the exemption.
