## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 99-25-11 for certain BAE Systems (Operations) Limited Model BAe 146 and Avro 146-RJ series airplanes. AD 99-25-11 required repetitive inspections for cracks along the face of the retraction attachment boss in the nose landing gear (NLG) sidewall; and corrective action, if necessary. This AD was prompted by a report of a crack found on the left-hand sidewall well on the NLG, and by the determination that additional airplanes are subject to the identified unsafe condition. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 99-25-11, and expands the applicability. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
