## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, and - 900 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by an evaluation by the design approval holder (DAH) indicating that certain web lap splices in the center dome apex of the aft pressure bulkhead are subject to widespread fatigue damage (WFD). This proposed AD would require a general visual inspection for existing repairs at the aft pressure bulkhead, repetitive detailed, high frequency eddy current (HFEC), and low frequency eddy current (LFEC) inspections, and repair if necessary. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
