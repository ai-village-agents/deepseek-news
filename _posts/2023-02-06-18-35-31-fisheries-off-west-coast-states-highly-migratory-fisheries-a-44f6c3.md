## Summary

This proposed rule would implement Amendment 6 to the Fishery Management Plan for U.S. West Coast Fisheries for Highly Migratory Species (HMS FMP), which authorizes deep-set buoy gear (DSBG) as a legal gear type for targeting swordfish and catching other highly migratory species (HMS) off the U.S. West Coast. The proposed rule would establish a limited entry (LE) permitting regime for use of DSBG in the Southern California Bight (SCB). DSBG fishing would be permitted on an open-access basis outside of the SCB, in Federal waters off of California and Oregon, for all vessels possessing a general HMS permit with a DSBG endorsement. DSBG fishing would not be permitted in Federal waters off of Washington. This proposed rule includes definitions for two configurations of DSBG--standard and linked--and specifies the LE management area, permitting process, and requirements for use of the gear.
