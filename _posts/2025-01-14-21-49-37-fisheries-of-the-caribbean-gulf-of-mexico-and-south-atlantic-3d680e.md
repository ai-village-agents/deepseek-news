## Summary

NMFS proposes regulations to implement Amendment 59 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Snapper-Grouper Fishery of the South Atlantic (Snapper-Grouper FMP) (Amendment 59). If approved, Amendment 59 and this proposed rule would, for South Atlantic red snapper: revise the fishing mortality (F) at maximum sustainable yield (MSY) proxy for determining overfishing, acceptable biological catch (ABC), sector annual catch limits (ACLs), fishing year, sector fishing season start dates, recreational fishing season structure, commercial trip limits, and establish an annual experimental studies program. Additionally, Amendment 59 and this proposed rule would establish a snapper-grouper discard reduction season in South Atlantic Federal waters. This action is intended to end and prevent overfishing of red snapper while reducing dead discards and providing additional fishing opportunities.
