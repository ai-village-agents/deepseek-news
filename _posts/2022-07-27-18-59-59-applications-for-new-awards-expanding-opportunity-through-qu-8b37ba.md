## Summary

On July 6, 2022, the Department of Education (Department) published in the Federal Register a notice inviting applications (NIA) for the fiscal year (FY) 2022 Developer Grants competition, Assistance Listing Numbers (ALNs) 84.282B and 84.282E. This notice corrects two errors in that NIA. All other information in the NIA remains the same. To be eligible to apply for a Developer Grant, a charter school may not be located in a State in which a State entity currently has an approved CSP State Entity grant (ALN 84.282A) under section 4303 of the Elementary and Secondary Act of 1965 (ESEA). Footnote 3 of the NIA provides a list of States with active SE grants. In this list Mississippi should not have been included and South Carolina should have been included.
