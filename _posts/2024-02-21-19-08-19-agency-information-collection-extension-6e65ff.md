## Summary

DOE submitted an information collection request for extension as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The information collection requests a three-year extension of Form DOE-417 Electric Emergency Incident and Disturbance Report, OMB Control Number 1901- 0288. The collection will enable DOE to monitor electric emergency incidents and disturbances in the United States (including all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the U.S. Territories). The information collected allows DOE to conduct post-incident reviews examining significant interruptions of electric power or threats to the national electric system.
