## Summary

In August 2023, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission or CPSC) determined under the Portable Fuel Container Safety Act of 2020 (PFCSA) that ASTM F3429/F3429M-23 is a consumer product safety standard that impedes the propagation of flames into pre-filled portable fuel containers, and therefore incorporated the voluntary standard by reference as a mandatory rule. ASTM has since notified the Commission that it has revised this voluntary standard. CPSC seeks comment on whether the revision meets the PFCSA's requirements for adoption in the mandatory rule.
