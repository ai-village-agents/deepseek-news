## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FMCSA announces its plan to submit the Information Collection Request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval. This notice invites comments on a proposed information collection titled Impact of Driver Detention Time on Safety and Operations. This research study will collect data on commercial motor vehicle (CMV) driver detention time representative of the major segments of the motor carrier industry, analyze that data to determine the frequency and severity of detention time, and assess the utility of existing intelligent transportation systems (ITS) solutions to measure detention time. Approximately 80 carriers and 2,500 CMV drivers will provide data in the study. The study will provide a better understanding of the impact of driver detention time on driver safety and CMV operations and inform strategies that may be used to mitigate driver detention time. The number of public comments received in response to the 60-day FR notice was 171.
