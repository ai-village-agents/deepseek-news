## Summary

This action amends the Class E airspace at Pontiac, IL. This action is the result of an airspace review conducted due to the decommissioning of the Pontiac very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program. The geographic coordinates of the airport are also being updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database. This action brings the airspace into compliance with FAA orders and supports instrument flight rule (IFR) procedures and operations.
