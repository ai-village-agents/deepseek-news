## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is conducting a survey of its materials licensees to gather data to inform its decision on a future rulemaking action. The NRC established a nuclear-industry- specific size standard for categorizing the size of small business entities. The responses to this survey will provide the information necessary for the NRC to reassess, and potentially revise, its small entity size standards.
