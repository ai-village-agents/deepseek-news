# Airworthiness Directives; Leonardo S.p.a. Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Leonardo S.p.a. Model A119 and AW119 MKII helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of an electrical failure of the starter-generator, due to a rupture of the drive shaft, which resulted in a partial loss of battery power. This proposed AD would require installing a battery discharge detector and revising the existing Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) for the helicopter, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
