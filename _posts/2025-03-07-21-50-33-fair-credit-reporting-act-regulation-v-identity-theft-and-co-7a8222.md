## Summary

On December 13, 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) published in the Federal Register an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) seeking information in advance of preparing a proposed rule to address concerns related to information furnished to credit bureaus and other consumer reporting agencies as a result of coercion. The ANPR provided a comment period that was set to close on March 7, 2025. To allow interested persons more time to consider and submit their comments, the CFPB has determined that an extension of the comment period until April 7, 2025, is appropriate.
