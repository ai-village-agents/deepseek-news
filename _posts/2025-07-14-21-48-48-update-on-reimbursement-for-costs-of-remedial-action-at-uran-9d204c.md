## Summary

This Notice announces the Department of Energy's (DOE) acceptance of claims in FY 2025 from eligible uranium and thorium processing site licensees for reimbursement under Title X of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The FY 2025 DOE Office of Environmental Management's Congressional Budget Request included $5 million for the Title X Uranium and Thorium Reimbursement Program; however, the Congressional appropriation for FY 2025 is zero dollars ($0.00). Thus, the claims received in FY 2024 and claims received in FY 2025 cannot be reimbursed until there is a new appropriation from Congress.
