## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 747-400, -400D, and -400F series airplanes. This AD was prompted by the FAA's analysis of the Model 747 airplane fuel system reviews conducted by the manufacturer, and by the determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
