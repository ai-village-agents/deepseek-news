## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, Agency, or we) is denying Poornanand Palaparty's (Dr. Palaparty's) request for a hearing and issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) debarring Dr. Palaparty for 3 years from providing services in any capacity to a person that has an approved or pending drug product application. FDA bases this order on a finding that Dr. Palaparty was convicted of a misdemeanor under Federal law for causing the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of drugs that were misbranded under the FD&C Act. Additionally, FDA finds that the type of conduct underlying Dr. Palaparty's conviction undermines the process for the regulation of drugs. In determining the appropriateness and period of Dr. Palaparty's debarment, FDA considered the relevant factors listed in the FD&C Act. Dr. Palaparty failed to file with the Agency information and analyses sufficient to create a basis for a hearing concerning this action.
