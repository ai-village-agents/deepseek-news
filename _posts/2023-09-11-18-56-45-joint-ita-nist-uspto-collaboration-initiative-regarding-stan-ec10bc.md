## Summary

The International Trade Administration (ITA) creates prosperity by strengthening the international competitiveness of U.S. industry, promoting trade and investment, and ensuring fair trade and compliance with trade laws and agreements. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) promotes U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) plays an important role in incentivizing and protecting innovation, including innovations contributed to international standards bodies. In May 2023, the White House announced the United States Government National Standards Strategy for Critical and Emerging Technology ("the Strategy"), which, among other things, seeks to strengthen U.S. engagement in standards for critical and emerging technologies. As a means to further the implementation of the Strategy, and pursuant to a Request for Information on Implementation of the United States Government National Standards Strategy for Critical and Emerging Technology published by NIST (Docket No. NIST-2023-0005), ITA, NIST, and the USPTO ("the Agencies") are initiating a listening session with stakeholders focused on issues at the intersection of standards and intellectual property. The Agencies are seeking stakeholder input on the current state of U.S. firm participation in standard setting, and the ability of U.S. industry to readily adopt standards to grow and compete, especially as that relates to the standardization of critical and emerging technologies.
