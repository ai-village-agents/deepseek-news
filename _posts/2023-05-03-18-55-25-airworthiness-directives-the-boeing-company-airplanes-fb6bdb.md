## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-09-18, which applies to all The Boeing Company Model 707, 717, and 727 airplanes; Model DC-8, DC-9, and DC-10 airplanes; Model MD-10 and MD-11 airplanes; Model DC-9-81 (MD-81), DC-9-82 (MD-82), DC-9-83 (MD- 83), DC-9-87 (MD-87), and MD-88 airplanes; and Model MD 90-30 airplanes. AD 2022-09-18 requires revising the limitations and operating procedures sections of the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to incorporate specific operating procedures for, depending on the airplane model, instrument landing system (ILS) approaches, non-precision approaches, ground spoiler deployment, and go-around and missed approaches, when in the presence of 5G C Band interference as identified by Notices to Air Missions (NOTAMs). Since the FAA issued AD 2022-09-18, the FAA determined that additional limitations are needed due to the continued deployment of new 5G C-Band base stations whose signals are expected to cover most of the contiguous United States at transmission frequencies between 3.7- 3.98 GHz. This proposed AD would require revising the limitations and operating procedures sections of the AFM to incorporate specific operating procedures for, depending on the airplane model, ILS approaches, non-precision approaches, ground spoiler deployment, and go-around and missed approaches, due to the presence of 5G C-Band interference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
