## Summary

The USDA Forest Service published a notice of intent (NOI) to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) in the Federal Register on May 17, 2019 (84 FR 22432). The NOI served as the scoping document for the Forest Plan Amendment for Planning and Management of Domestic Sheep and Goat Grazing Within the Range of Bighorn Sheep for the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest (Forest). After the initial 2019 scoping effort, the Forest determined the need to update the NOI with new dates for the draft EIS and final EIS, new contact information, revised need for action, revised proposed action, preliminary alternatives, and nature of the decision to be made.
