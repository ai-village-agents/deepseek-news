## Summary

The Board is adopting a final rule to revise the Board's regulations related to determinations of whether a company has the ability to exercise a controlling influence over another company for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act or the Home Owners' Loan Act. The final rule expands the number of presumptions for use in such determinations. By codifying the presumptions in the Board's Regulation Y and Regulation LL, the Board's rules will provide substantial additional transparency on the types of relationships that the Board generally views as supporting a determination that one company controls another company. The final rule is largely consistent with the proposal and includes certain targeted adjustments to the Board's historical practice, as described in detail in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION.
