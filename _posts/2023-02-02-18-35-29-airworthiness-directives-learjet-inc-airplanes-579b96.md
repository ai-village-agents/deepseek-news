## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Learjet, Inc., Model 45 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD requires revising the existing inspection program to incorporate reduced inspection intervals for the anti-ice manifold assembly. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
