## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finds that 42 states and territories have failed to submit state plans for the 2016 Emission Guidelines and Compliance Times for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills (MSW Landfills EG). According to the MSW Landfills EG, states were required to submit state plans to the EPA for review and approval by August 29, 2019. The compliance times in the new implementing regulations for the MSW Landfills EG also establish a deadline of 2 years for the EPA to promulgate a federal plan for states that have failed to submit a state plan. It should be noted that the new implementing regulations do not impose sanctions or set deadlines for imposing sanctions for these states.
