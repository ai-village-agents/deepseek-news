## Summary

This notice sets forth the reasons for the denial of a petition submitted on September 27, 2021, by Mr. James Lamb to NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation (ODI). The petition requests that the Agency initiate an investigation into alleged "defects in the 2006 J1939 databus," citing a 2016 research paper published through the University of Michigan. On December 23, 2021, NHTSA opened Defect Petition DP21-005 to evaluate the petitioner's request. After reviewing the information provided by the petitioner regarding the alleged defect and conducting searches of complaints from vehicle owners, operators, and fleet supervisors, NHTSA has concluded that there is insufficient evidence to warrant further action at this time. Accordingly, the Agency has denied the petition.
