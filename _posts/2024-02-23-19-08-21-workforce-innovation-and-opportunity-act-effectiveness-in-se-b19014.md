## Summary

The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) establishes six primary indicators of performance and defines five of those performance indicators. With this final rule, the U.S. Departments of Labor and Education (Departments) define the sixth performance indicator--effectiveness in serving employers--as Retention with the Same Employer and require it be reported by one WIOA core program on behalf of all six WIOA core programs within each State. This final rule incorporates two changes from the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM): the final rule does not limit the type of wage information that must be used, thereby permitting the use of supplemental wage information in the definition of the effectiveness in serving employers performance indicator, and it specifies that the definition is measuring retention in unsubsidized employment.
