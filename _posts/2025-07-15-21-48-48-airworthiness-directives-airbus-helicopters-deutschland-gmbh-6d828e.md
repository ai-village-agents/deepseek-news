## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (AHD) Model MBB-BK 117 D-3 helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of over-torqued swashplate bolts on helicopters in service and in production. This AD requires removal of certain swashplate bolts from service and replacement with new (never previously installed on a helicopter) bolts, a one-time inspection for damage on the threads of the bearing ring and control ring of the swashplate and, depending on the results of the inspection, corrective actions. This AD also prohibits the installation of certain swashplates on any helicopter unless certain requirements are met. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
