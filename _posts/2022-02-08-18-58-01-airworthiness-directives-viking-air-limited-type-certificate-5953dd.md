## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Viking Air Limited (Viking) (type certificate previously held by Bombardier Inc. and de Havilland, Inc.) Model DHC-3 airplanes. This proposed AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI describes the unsafe condition as corrosion, wear, and fatigue- related degradation in aging aircraft. This proposed AD would require establishing a corrosion prevention and control program to identify and correct corrosion and cracking. This proposed AD would also require completing all of the initial tasks identified in the program and reporting corrosion findings to Viking. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
