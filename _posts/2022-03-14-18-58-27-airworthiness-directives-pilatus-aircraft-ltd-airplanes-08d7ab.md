## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2016-26-08, which applies to all Pilatus Aircraft Ltd. Model PC-12, PC- 12/45, PC-12/47, and PC-12/47E airplanes. AD 2016-26-08 requires incorporating revisions into the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the maintenance program and inspecting the main landing gear (MLG) attachment bolts for cracks and corrosion. Since the FAA issued AD 2016-26-08, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) superseded its mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) to add a new life limit for certain MLG actuator bottom attachment bolts and then superseded it again to add new life limits for the rudder bellcrank. This proposed AD would require incorporating new revisions to the ALS of the existing airplane maintenance manual (AMM) or Instructions for Continued Airworthiness (ICA) to establish a 5-year life limit for certain MLG actuator bottom attachment bolts and new life limits for the rudder bellcrank. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
