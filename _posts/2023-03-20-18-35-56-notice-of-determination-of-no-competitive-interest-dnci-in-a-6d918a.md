## Summary

BOEM provides notice of its determination that competitive interest does not exist in the area identified in "Research Lease on the [OCS] in the Gulf of Maine, Request for Competitive Interest (RFCI)" published in the Federal Register on August 19, 2022. BOEM published that RFCI after receiving an OCS renewable energy research lease application from the State of Maine Governor's office in October 2021. BOEM received complete submissions in response to the RFCI from two qualified entities. Upon review of the whole record, including the two responses, BOEM determined that any interest in the lease area is not competitive.
