## Summary

Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission (the "Commission") has determined not to review an initial determination ("ID") (Order No. 36) terminating Direct Technologies International, Inc. on the basis of consent order. The Commission has determined to issue a consent order. The Commission has further determined to find that the complainants' declaration seeking immediate relief against certain respondents previously found to be in default is moot. The Commission also requests written submissions from the complainants, interested government agencies, and interested persons on the issues of remedy, the public interest, and bonding concerning certain respondents found in default.
