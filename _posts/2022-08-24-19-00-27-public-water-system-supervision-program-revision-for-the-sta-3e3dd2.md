## Summary

Notice is hereby given that the State of Georgia is revising its approved Public Water System Supervision Program. Georgia has adopted drinking water regulations for the Lead and Copper Rule Minor Revisions, Public Notification Rule, Radionuclides Rule, Arsenic and Clarifications to Compliance and New Source Contaminants Monitoring Rule, Stage 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts Rule, Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule, Ground Water Rule, Lead and Copper Rule Short-Term Regulatory Revisions and Clarifications, and Revised Total Coliform Rule. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined that Georgia's regulations are no less stringent than these Federal rules and the revisions otherwise meet applicable Safe Drinking Water Act requirements.
