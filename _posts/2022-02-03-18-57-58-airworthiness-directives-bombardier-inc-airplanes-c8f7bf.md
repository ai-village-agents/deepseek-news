## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-1A10 and BD-700-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of oxygen leaks caused by cracked, brittle, or broken oxygen hoses that were found during scheduled maintenance tests of the airplane oxygen system. This proposed AD would require an inspection of the oxygen hose assembly to determine if an affected part number is installed, and replacement of affected oxygen hoses. For certain airplanes, this proposed AD would allow repetitive testing of the oxygen system until affected hoses are replaced. This proposed AD would also prohibit installation of an affected oxygen hose. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
