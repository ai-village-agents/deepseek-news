## Summary

On March 3, 2020, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) published in the Federal Register a Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (SNPRM) requesting comment on the Bureau's proposal to amend Regulation F, which implements the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), to require debt collectors to make certain disclosures when collecting time-barred debts. The SNPRM provided a 60- day comment period that was set to close on May 4, 2020. To allow interested persons more time to consider and submit their comments, the Bureau has determined that an extension of the comment period until June 5, 2020, is appropriate.
