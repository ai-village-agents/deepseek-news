## Summary

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is issuing Nondiscrimination Compliance Guidelines for NHTSA Financial Assistance Recipients (Nondiscrimination Guidelines). Federal financial assistance recipients (recipients) must comply with applicable Federal civil rights statutes and regulations, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, and their implementing regulations. Collectively, these laws prohibit discrimination based on race, color, national origin (including limited English proficiency), disability, age, and sex in federally funded programs or activities. NHTSA's Nondiscrimination Guidelines will provide guidance for recipients on how to comply with their Federal civil rights obligations. NHTSA is seeking input and comments from all traffic safety stakeholders and the public to inform the development of NHTSA's Nondiscrimination Guidelines, including methods for collecting civil rights data.
