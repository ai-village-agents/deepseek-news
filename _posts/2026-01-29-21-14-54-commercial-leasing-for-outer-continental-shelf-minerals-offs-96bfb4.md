## Summary

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) is initiating the first steps that could potentially lead to a lease sale for minerals on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) offshore Alaska by publishing this request for information and interest (RFI). This RFI is not a final decision to lease and does not prejudge any future Secretarial decisions concerning leasing on the OCS offshore Alaska. This RFI requests information and comments on, and indications of interest in, the leasing of OCS minerals in an area offshore Alaska, referred to as the RFI Area, with details in Section 5 "Description of the RFI Area." BOEM will consider information and interest received in response to this RFI when considering whether to proceed with additional steps leading to the offer of OCS minerals for lease offshore Alaska. Those interested in providing comments or information should provide the information requested in Section 6 "Types of Information and Comments Requested," of this RFI. Those interested in leasing in and around the RFI Area for OCS mineral development should provide the information described in Section 7 "Requested Information for Indications of Interest." BOEM will decide whether and under what terms and conditions to hold a lease sale for commercial OCS mineral development offshore Alaska after further consideration, consultations, public participation, and environmental analyses.
