## Summary

This interim final rule provides procedures to implement certain provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21 NDAA) and the National Defense Authorization for Fiscal Year 2022 (FY22 NDAA). The FY21 NDAA authorized the Secretary of Transportation to establish the Tanker Security Program (TSP) comprised of a fleet of active, commercially viable, militarily useful, privately owned product tank vessels of the United States. The fleet will meet national defense and other security requirements and maintain a United States presence in international commercial shipping. The FY22 NDAA made minor adjustments related to the participation of long-term charters in the TSP. The Maritime Administration solicits written comments on this rulemaking.
