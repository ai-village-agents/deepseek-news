## Summary

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS or Department) is issuing this final rule to make effective the exemptions that were previously proposed for a subset of records covered in a new Privacy Act system of records, No. 09-25-0165, NIH Loan Repayment Records, which is maintained by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The system of records covers records used to manage and evaluate the Loan Repayment Programs (LRPs) at NIH. The exemptions are necessary to maintain the integrity of the NIH peer review and award processes by enabling NIH to protect the identities of reviewers.
