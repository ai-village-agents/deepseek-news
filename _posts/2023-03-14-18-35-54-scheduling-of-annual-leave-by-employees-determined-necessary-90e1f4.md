## Summary

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is revising the interim regulation regarding the restoration of annual leave for employees who are essential to respond to certain national emergencies, such as the National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). This rule extends the latest possible termination date for the exigency established in connection with the COVID-19 national emergency, which would be March 13, 2023, under the current interim regulations. Under this new rule, that date would be the date the national emergency is ended by the President. This rule also provides for special handling of restored annual leave resulting from an agency- specific ongoing exigency that is directly related to a matter that was determined to be a national emergency exigency and that immediately follows that national emergency exigency. Finally, this rule expands an agency's authority to exempt employees from the advance annual leave scheduling requirement in the leave year during which a national emergency exigency is terminated.
