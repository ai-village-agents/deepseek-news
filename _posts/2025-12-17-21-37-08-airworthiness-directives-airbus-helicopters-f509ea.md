# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model AS355E, AS 355-F, AS 355-F1, AS355F2, AS355N, and AS355NP helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a structural crack in the vertical attachment spar of the tail fin. This proposed AD would require repetitive inspections of certain vertical upper fin spars and, depending on the results, corrective action. This proposed AD would also prohibit installing certain upper fin assemblies. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
