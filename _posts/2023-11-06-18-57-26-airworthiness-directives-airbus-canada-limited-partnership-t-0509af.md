## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD- 500-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of possible chafing of a power harness at fuselage frame (FR) 65. This proposed AD would require rerouting the power harness, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
