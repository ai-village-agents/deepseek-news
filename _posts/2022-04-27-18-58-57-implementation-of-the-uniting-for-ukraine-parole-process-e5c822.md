## Summary

This notice announces the implementation of a U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) parole process called Uniting for Ukraine. Pursuant to this process, DHS will offer certain Ukrainian citizens and their immediate family members who were recently displaced by Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine, pass biometric and biographic vetting, have sufficient financial support in the United States, and meet other eligibility requirements, an opportunity to apply for and receive advance authorization to travel to the United States for the purpose of seeking a discretionary grant of parole for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit for up to two years. The process is intended to be a safe, legal, and orderly pathway to support vulnerable Ukrainian citizens and their immediate family members in Europe who have been displaced from their country as a result of Russia's unprovoked invasion.
