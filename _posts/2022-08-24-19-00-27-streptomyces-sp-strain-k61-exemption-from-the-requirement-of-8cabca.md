## Summary

This regulation amends the existing exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of Streptomyces sp. strain K61 in or on all raw agricultural commodities when used as a fungicide for the treatment of seeds, cuttings, transplants, and plants of agricultural crops in accordance with good agricultural practices by removing the fungicidal use stipulation and clarifying that the exemption covers use in or on all food commodities when used in accordance with label directions and good agricultural practices. Danstar Ferment Ag/LALLEMAND PLANT CARE, submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting that EPA amend the existing tolerance exemption for Streptomyces sp. strain K61. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of Streptomyces sp. strain K61 under FFDCA.
