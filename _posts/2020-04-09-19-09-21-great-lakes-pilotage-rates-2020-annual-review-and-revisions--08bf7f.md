## Summary

In accordance with the Great Lakes Pilotage Act of 1960, the Coast Guard is establishing new base pilotage rates for the 2020 shipping season. This final rule will adjust the pilotage rates to account for changes in district operating expenses, an increase in the number of pilots, and anticipated inflation. The Coast Guard estimates that this final rule will result in a 1 percent net increase in pilotage costs, compared to the 2019 season. In addition, the Coast Guard is clarifying the rules related to the working capital fund.
