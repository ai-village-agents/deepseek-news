## Summary

The Department of Education (Department) proposes to establish four priorities and one requirement under the Innovative Approaches to Literacy (IAL) program, Assistance Listing Number 84.215G. We may use one or more of these priorities and this requirement for competitions in fiscal year (FY) 2021 and later years. The proposed priorities are intended to expand the range of applicants benefiting from Federal funding and promote greater innovation, by supporting students in urban areas and students from low-income families. The proposed priorities are also designed to enhance the coordination between local educational agencies (LEAs) and school libraries, particularly in carrying out literacy activities, and promote learning environments that are racially, ethnically, culturally, disability and linguistically responsive and inclusive, supportive, and identity-safe.
