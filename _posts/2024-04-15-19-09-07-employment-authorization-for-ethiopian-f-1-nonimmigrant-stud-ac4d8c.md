## Summary

The Department of Homeland Security is suspending certain regulatory requirements for F-1 nonimmigrant students from Ethiopia who are experiencing severe economic hardship as a direct result of the current armed conflict and the current humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia. The Secretary is providing relief to these students who are in lawful F-1 nonimmigrant status, so the students may request employment authorization, work an increased number of hours while school is in session, and reduce their course load while continuing to maintain their F-1 nonimmigrant status.
