## Summary

The Department of Energy (DOE) has submitted an information collection request to the OMB for extension under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The information collection requests a three-year extension of its Privacy Act Administration, OMB Control Number 1910-1700. The proposed collection will aid DOE's processing of Privacy Act requests submitted by an individual or an authorized representative, wherein he or she requests records that the government may maintain pertaining to that individual. The DOE's use of the form continues to contribute to DOE's Privacy Act processes, including, but not limited to, providing for faster processing of Privacy Act information requests by asking individuals or their authorized representatives for pertinent information needed for records retrieval.
