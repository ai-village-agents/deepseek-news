## Summary

The FDIC is adopting a final rule to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules by 2 basis points, beginning the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The increase in the assessment rate schedules will increase the likelihood that the reserve ratio will reach the statutory minimum of 1.35 percent by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2028, consistent with the FDIC's Amended Restoration Plan, and is intended to support growth in the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF or fund) in progressing toward the FDIC's long-term goal of a 2 percent Designated Reserve Ratio (DRR).
