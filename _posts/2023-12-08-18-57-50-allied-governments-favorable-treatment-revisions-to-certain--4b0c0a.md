## Summary

The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is amending the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by removing Proliferation of Chemical and Biological Weapons (CB) controls on specified pathogens and toxins that are destined for Australia Group (AG) member countries and by revising the Commerce Country Chart to remove Crime Control and Detection (CC) controls on certain items that are destined for Austria, Finland, Ireland, Liechtenstein, South Korea, Sweden, and Switzerland. These changes are being made as part of a broader effort announced today that will liberalize several categories of export licensing requirements and the availability of export license exceptions for key allied and partner countries, as well as for members of certain multilateral export control regimes.
