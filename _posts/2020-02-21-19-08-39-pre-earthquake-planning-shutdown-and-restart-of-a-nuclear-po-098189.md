## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing Revision 1 to Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.166, "Pre-Earthquake Planning, Shutdown, and Restart of a Nuclear Power Plant Following an Earthquake." This revision of RG 1.166 merges two related RGs, that is, RG 1.166 and RG 1.167, "Restart of a Nuclear Power Plant Shut Down by a Seismic Event." The guides were merged because they are similar in nature and contain overlapping guidance. RG 1.167 is being withdrawn concurrently because it is no longer needed.
