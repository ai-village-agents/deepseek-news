## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-09- 01, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; Model A319 series airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, - 233, -251N, -252N, -253N, -271N, -272N, and -273N airplanes; and Model A321 series airplanes. AD 2023-09-01 was prompted by a report that certain overheat detection system (OHDS) sensing elements installed at certain positions might not properly detect thermal bleed leak events due to a quality escape during the manufacturing process. AD 2023-09-01 required a one-time detailed inspection of each affected part installed at an affected position and replacement if necessary and prohibited the installation of affected parts at affected positions. Since the FAA issued AD 2023-09-01, a new airplane model (A321-253NY) has been certified by EASA, on which affected parts could be installed in service. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2023-09-01, and revises the applicability to include Model A321-253NY airplanes, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
