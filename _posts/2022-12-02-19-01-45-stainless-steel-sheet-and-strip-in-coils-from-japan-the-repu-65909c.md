## Summary

As a result of these sunset reviews, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) finds that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) orders on stainless steel sheet and strip in coils (SSSSC) from Japan, the Republic of Korea (Korea), and Taiwan would be likely to lead to the continuation or recurrence of dumping at the dumping margins identified in the "Final Results of Reviews" section of this notice.
