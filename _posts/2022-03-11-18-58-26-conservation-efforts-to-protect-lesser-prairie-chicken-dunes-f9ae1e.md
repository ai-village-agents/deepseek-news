## Summary

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) is extending the public comment periods for three notices, due to temporary website outages that affected the public's access to the documents that the notices are making available for comment. The notices pertained to a combined candidate conservation agreement (CCA)\ candidate conservation agreements with assurances (CCAA) amendment, an oil and gas habitat conservation plan (HCP), and a new CCAA. The affected species include the lesser prairie- chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus), the dunes sagebrush lizard (Sceloporus arenicolus), and the Texas kangaroo rat (Dipodomys elator).
