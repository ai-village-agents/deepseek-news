## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for the navigable water within a 500-yard radius of several tugs and barges in the Straits of Mackinac. The safety zone is needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from the potential hazards created by the work, inspection, surveying and the removal and replacement of cables for the Straits of Mackinac. Entry of vessels or persons into the zone is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port Sault Sainte Marie or their designated representative. Due to the lengthy duration of this safety zone, the Coast Guard is accepting and reviewing public comments until May 7, 2021. While this rule is being enforced beginning April 20, 2021, the Coast Guard reserves the right to modify the safety zone if an issue is raised by the public comments that requires such a modification.
