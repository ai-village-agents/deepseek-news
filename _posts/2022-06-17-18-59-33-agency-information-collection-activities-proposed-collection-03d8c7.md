## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is planning to submit the information collection request (ICR), Hazardous Waste Generator Standards (Renewal) (EPA ICR No. 0820.15, OMB Control No. 2050-0035) to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). Before doing so, the EPA is soliciting public comments on specific aspects of the proposed information collection as described in Supplementary Information.

An Agency may not conduct or sponsor and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
