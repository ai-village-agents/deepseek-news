## Summary

The Rural Housing Service (RHS or Agency), is implementing changes to Single-Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program (SFHGLP) to mandate the use of the Guaranteed Underwriting System (GUS) and the Lender Loan Closing System (LLC) by approved lenders. The Agency's mandated use of GUS in loan originations and the LLC for loan closings will allow the Agency to decrease time-consuming and expensive manual file reviews, improve performance monitoring and reduce program risk of the guaranteed loan portfolio.
