## Summary

HUD's regulations require that mortgagees of Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insured single family mortgages (mortgagees) meet in person, or make a reasonable effort to meet in person, with mortgagors who are in default on their mortgage payments. This rule proposes to modernize this requirement by updating HUD's regulation to better align with advances in electronic communication technology and mortgagor engagement preferences, while preserving consumer protections. Specifically, this rule proposes to update HUD's current in-person, face-to-face meeting requirements by permitting mortgagees to utilize methods of communication most likely to receive a response from the mortgagor as determined by the Secretary, including electronic and other remote communication methods, such as telephone calls or video calls, to meet with mortgagors who are in default on their mortgage payments. This proposed rule would also expand the meeting requirement to all mortgagors in default, including mortgagors who do not reside in the mortgaged property and those with a mortgaged property not within 200 miles of their mortgagee, its servicer, or a branch office of either.
