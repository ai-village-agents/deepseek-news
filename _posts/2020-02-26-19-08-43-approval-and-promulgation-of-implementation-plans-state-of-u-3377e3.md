## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of Utah on January 4, 2016, which include revisions to Utah's Division of Administrative Rule (DAR) R307-110-10 and maintenance plans for the Salt Lake County, Utah County, and Ogden City nonattainment areas (NAAs) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 microns (PM<INF>10</INF>), and on March 6, 2019, which include PM<INF>10</INF> redesignation requests and supplemental information for Salt Lake County, Utah County and Ogden City. These submittals demonstrated that the Salt Lake County, Utah County and Ogden City areas have attained the PM<INF>10</INF> National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), request redesignation to attainment, and include maintenance plans for the areas demonstrating attainment for fifteen years. Also, the EPA is approving Utah's February 27, 2017 submittal, which includes rule revisions to address our October 19, 2016 conditional approval of Utah's DAR R307-302 revisions that were submitted May 9, 2013, May 20, 2014 and September 8, 2015. Additionally, the EPA is approving SIP revisions submitted by the State of Utah on February 15, 2019, with additional non-substantive changes submitted on July 1, 2019, August 20, 2019, and October 15, 2019, which includes revisions that are located in DAR R307-110-17 and SIP Subsections IX.H.1-2. We are also approving the transportation conformity motor vehicle emissions budgets (MVEB), for each of the three maintenance areas, as described in our proposed rule. The EPA is taking this action pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act).
