## Summary

We, NMFS, designate critical habitat for the threatened Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus) pursuant to section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Specific areas designated as critical habitat contain approximately 2,384.67 sq. kilometers (km) (920.73 sq. miles) of aquatic habitat located in waters off the coasts of southeastern Florida, Puerto Rico, Navassa, and the United States Virgin Islands (USVI). We have considered positive and negative economic, national security, and other relevant impacts of the critical habitat designation, as well as all public comments that were received.
