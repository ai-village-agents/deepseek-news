# Connect America Fund; Developing a Unified Intercarrier Compensation Regime

## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission clarifies its interpretation of the VoIP Symmetry Rule, finding that the 2015 Declaratory Ruling was misguided in its interpretation of the VoIP Symmetry Rule and holding that a LEC providing retail service with a VoIP provider partner provides the functional equivalent of end office switching and thus may assess end office switched access charges only if either the LEC or its VoIP partner provides a physical connection to the last-mile facilities used to serve the end user. By adopting this interpretation of the VOIP Symmetry Rule, the Commission reduces intercarrier disputes and uncertainty and promotes competition.
