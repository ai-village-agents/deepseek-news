## Summary

EPA is announcing proposed revisions to the EPA-administered federal pesticide applicator certification plan to certify applicators of restricted use pesticides in areas of Indian country that are not covered by any other EPA-approved certification plan. After this proposed plan is finalized and implemented, certification of applicators in Indian country will be administered by EPA, unless a tribe submits its own tribal certification plan, enters into a tribal- EPA agreement, or opts out of the revised EPA Plan. EPA is soliciting comments on EPA's proposed revisions to the federal certification plan in Indian country where no other EPA-approved plan applies.
