## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2015-12-03, which applies to certain The Boeing Company Model 777-200, -200LR, -300, and -300ER series airplanes. AD 2015-12-03 requires repetitive freeplay inspections and lubrication of the right and left elevators, rudder, and rudder tab, and related investigative and corrective actions if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2015-12-03, engineering testing revealed that the force being applied to the elevator to detect excessive freeplay was insufficient. This proposed AD would continue to require certain actions in AD 2015-12-03 for certain airplanes, and would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, for certain other airplanes, to incorporate a revised or new elevator freeplay maintenance procedure, as applicable. This proposed AD would also add airplanes to the applicability. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
