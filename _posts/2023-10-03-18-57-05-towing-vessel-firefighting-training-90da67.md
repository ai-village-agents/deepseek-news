## Summary

The Coast Guard is issuing this final rule to revise the training requirements for national Merchant Mariner Credential endorsements as master of towing vessels (limited) or mate (pilot) of towing vessels on inland waters or Western Rivers routes. Consistent with recommendations from two Federal advisory committees, this rule gives mariners seeking these endorsements the option of taking a modified basic firefighting course. That course excludes training on equipment that is not required to be carried on towing vessels operating on inland waters or the Western Rivers. Applicants who take the modified basic firefighting course will reduce their costs because it is shorter and less expensive than the basic firefighting course.
