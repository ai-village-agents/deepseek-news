## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain General Electric Company (GE) GEnx-1B and GEnx-2B model turbofan engines. This proposed AD was prompted by a manufacturer investigation that revealed that certain stages 6-10 compressor rotor spools and forward seals were manufactured from powder metal material suspected to contain iron inclusion. This proposed AD would require the replacement of the affected stages 6-10 compressor rotor spools and forward seals. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
