## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede five airworthiness directives (ADs) for all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd. & Co KG (RRD) Model RB211- 535E4-37, RB211-535E4-B-37, and RB211-535E4-C-37 engines. The existing ADs require recalculating the cyclic life for certain engine life- limited rotating parts and replacing those parts that have exceeded their cyclic life limit within specified compliance times. Since the FAA issued those ADs the manufacturer has revised the engine time limits manual (TLM), introducing new and more restrictive instructions. This proposed AD would require revising the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the existing approved maintenance or inspection program, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
