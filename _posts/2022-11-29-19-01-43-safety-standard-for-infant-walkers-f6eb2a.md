## Summary

In June 2010, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) published a consumer product safety standard for infant walkers under section 104 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA), incorporating by reference the 2007 version of ASTM's voluntary standard for infant walkers that was in effect at the time, with modifications approved by the Commission. ASTM updated its standard for infant walkers in 2012, and CPSC accepted the revised voluntary standard, without any modifications, as the mandatory standard for infant walkers. ASTM has notified CPSC of a 2022 update to the infant walkers voluntary standard. This direct final rule updates the mandatory standard for infant walkers to incorporate by reference ASTM's 2022 version of the voluntary standard.
