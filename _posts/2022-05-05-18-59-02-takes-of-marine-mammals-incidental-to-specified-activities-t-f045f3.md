## Summary

On April 22, 2022, a notice was published in the Federal Register announcing the issuance of an incidental harassment authorization (IHA) for take of marine mammals incidental to marine site characterization surveys off New Jersey. That document inadvertently omitted some text in NMFS' response to public comment 13. This document only corrects this error; all other information is unchanged.
