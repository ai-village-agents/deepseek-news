## Summary

EPA issued a document in the Federal Register of December 2, 2022, proposing significant new use rules (SNURs) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for chemical substances that were the subject of premanufacture notices (PMNs) and are also subject to Orders issued by EPA pursuant to TSCA. This document extends the comment period for 14 days, from January 3, 2023 to January 17, 2023, in response to stakeholder requests for more time to determine if and to what extent they may be affected by the proposed SNURs.
