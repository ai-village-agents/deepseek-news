## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is withdrawing its proposed approval of the request to redesignate the Kentucky portion of the Louisville, Kentucky-Indiana, 2015 8-hour ozone nonattainment area (hereinafter referred to as the "Louisville, KY-IN Area" or "Area") to attainment for the 2015 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS or standards). EPA is withdrawing its April 18, 2023, proposed approval and is now proposing to deny Kentucky's request to redesignate the Kentucky portion of the Area from nonattainment to attainment, based on the Area's violation of the NAAQS. EPA is taking no action at this time on Kentucky's maintenance plan, including the regional motor vehicle emission budgets for nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) for the years of 2019 and 2035, submitted with Kentucky's redesignation request for the Louisville, KY-IN Area. The redesignation request and maintenance plan state implementation plan (SIP) revision were submitted by the Commonwealth of Kentucky, through the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet (Cabinet), Division of Air Quality (DAQ), on September 6, 2022.
