## Summary

FMCSA proposes to increase flexibility for State Driver Licensing Agencies (SDLAs) and commercial driver's license (CDL) applicants by expanding applicants' ability to take a CDL skills test in a State other than their State of domicile; permitting a commercial learner's permit (CLP) holder who has passed the CDL skills test to operate a commercial motor vehicle (CMV) on public roads without having a qualified CDL holder in the passenger seat; eliminating the requirement that an applicant wait at least 14 days to take the CDL skills test following initial issuance of the CLP. The NPRM also proposes to remove the requirement that CMV drivers must have a passenger (P) endorsement to transport CMVs designed to carry passengers, including school buses, when the vehicle is being transported in a driveaway-towaway operation and the vehicle is not carrying any passengers. Additionally, FMCSA proposes to require that third-party knowledge examiners be subject to the training, certification, and record check standards currently applicable to State knowledge examiners and third-party knowledge testers be subject to the auditing and monitoring requirements now applicable to third-party skills testers. The NPRM responds to petitions for rulemaking from the American Trucking Associations (ATA) and the New Hampshire Department of Transportation (NHDOT), as discussed below. FMCSA believes these proposals would improve the efficiency and convenience of CDL issuance and improve highway safety by further ensuring the integrity of third- party CDL knowledge testing.
