## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval of a substantive change to multiple previously approved information collections. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, Section 546, requires the implementation of systems allowing a member of the public to submit any information or form to the Registry and conduct any transaction with the Registry by electronic or other remote means. In response to this requirement, the FAA created Civil Aviation Registry Electronic Services (CARES) and intends to change its current information collection to accommodate electronic registry applications.
