## Summary

The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) is requesting public input on proposed revisions to regulations related to client grievance procedures and prohibition of discrimination based on disability, respectively. LSC is considering expanding the regulations' scope to require grantees to establish grievance procedures for board members and ensure they are afforded disability protections. The main purpose of these proposals would be to give board members the same protections under the regulations as applicants for legal assistance, clients, and grantee employees.
