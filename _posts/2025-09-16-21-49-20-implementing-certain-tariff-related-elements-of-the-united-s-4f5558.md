## Summary

On July 23, 2025, the President announced a framework agreement between the United States and Japan (the Agreement), which lays the foundation for a new era of U.S.-Japan trade relations grounded in principles of reciprocity and our shared national interests. On September 4, 2025, the President issued Executive Order 14345, Implementing the United States-Japan Agreement, finding that specified tariff actions are consistent with the national interests of the United States and are necessary and appropriate to address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, as amended, and to reduce or eliminate the threats to national security found in certain proclamations issued under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Executive Order 14345 also directed and authorized the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to publish in the Federal Register changes to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) with respect to general tariffs on Japanese goods (in consultation with the United States Trade Representative, the Secretary of Homeland Security acting through the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and the Chair of the United States International Trade Commission (ITC)); products of Japan that fall under the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft, except for unmanned aircraft (in consultation with the Chair of the ITC and the Commissioner of CBP); and products of Japan subject to duties under Proclamation 10908 of March 26, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of Automobiles and Automobile Parts Into the United States) (in consultation with the Chair of the ITC and the Commissioner of CBP). This notice amends the HTSUS to implement these provisions of the Agreement.
