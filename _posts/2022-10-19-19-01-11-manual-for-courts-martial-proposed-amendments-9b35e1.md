## Summary

The proposed changes are based on the Fiscal Year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act and certain recommendations of the Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault in the Military. Due to the volume of proposed changes, they should be reviewed in their entirety. The approval authority for the changes to the MCM is the President, while the approval authority for the changes to the supplementary materials is the General Counsel of the DoD.
