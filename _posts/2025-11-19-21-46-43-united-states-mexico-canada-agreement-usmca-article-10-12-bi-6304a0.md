## Summary

A Request for Panel Review was filed on behalf of Deacero S.A.P.I. de C.V. and I.N.G.E.T.E.K.N.O.S. Estructurales, S.A. de C.V. with the United States Section of the USMCA Secretariat, pursuant to USMCA Article 10.12. Panel Review was requested of the U.S. Department of Commerce's Final Results in the 2022-2023 Administrative Review of Antidumping Duty Order on Steel Concrete Reinforcing Bar from Mexico. The USMCA Secretariat has assigned case number USA-MEX-2025-10.12-01 to this request. The Request for Panel Review was timely filed on October 2, 2025. Due to a lapse in appropriations for the U.S. federal government, the United States Section of the USMCA Secretariat was closed from October 1, 2025, through November 12, 2025. Thus, the Request for Panel Review was docketed on November 13, 2025, upon the office resuming operations; as such, November 13, 2025, shall be considered the start date for the dispute. The dispute timeline has been determined based on this date.
