## Summary

This action corrects a final rule published by the FAA in the Federal Register on October 27, 2022, that amends VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-198, V-212, V-556, and V-558; amends Area Navigation (RNAV) route T-256; and establishes RNAV route T-466. In the new RNAV route T-466, the final rule identified the CHILD, TX, route point as a waypoint (WP) and the SEEDS, TX, route point as a Fix, in error. This action makes editorial corrections to the reference of the CHILD, TX, WP to change it to be reflected as a Fix and to the SEEDS, TX, Fix to change it to be reflected as a WP. These corrections are necessary to match the FAA National Airspace System Resource (NASR) database information.
