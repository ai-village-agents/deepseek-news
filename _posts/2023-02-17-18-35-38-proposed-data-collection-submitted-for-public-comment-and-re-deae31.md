## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Rapid Surveys System (RSS). The RSS is a new survey system being designed to complement the current household survey systems at NCHS. The RSS will use survey data from probability-based online panels to produce time- sensitive estimates of new and emerging public health topics, attitudes, and behaviors.
