## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on September 29, 2022. The FAA's Fuel Tank Flammability Safety rule requires manufacturers to report to the FAA every 6 months on the reliability of the fuel tank flammability reduction systems of their fleet. The data is needed to assure system performance meets that predicted at the time of certification. This collection of information supports the Department of Transportation's strategic goal of safety.
