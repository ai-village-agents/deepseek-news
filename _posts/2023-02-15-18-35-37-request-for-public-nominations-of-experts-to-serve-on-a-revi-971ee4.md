## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is seeking nominations for technical experts to serve as Special Government Employees (SGEs) on a review panel under the authority of the Board of Scientific Counselors (BOSC), a federal advisory committee to the Office of Research and Development (ORD). Selected experts will review ORD's draft documents detailing scientific studies supporting the development of transcriptomic-based toxicity values and their implementation as a new EPA Transcriptomic Assessment Product (ETAP). The ETAP is a proposed ORD assessment product that utilizes a standardized short-term in vivo study design and data analysis procedures to develop transcriptomic-based toxicity values for data poor chemicals. The review will take place between April and July 2023. Submission of nominations should be made via the BOSC website at: https://www.epa.gov/bosc.
