## Summary

This document amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regulations to extend import restrictions on certain material from the Republic of El Salvador. The Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, U.S. Department of State, has made the requisite determinations for extending the import restrictions, originally imposed on certain archaeological material by Treasury Decision 95-20, and amended by CBP Decision 20-04 to cover certain ecclesiastical ethnological material. These import restrictions are being extended pursuant to an exchange of diplomatic notes. The CBP regulations are being amended to reflect this further extension through March 2, 2030.
