## Summary

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is seeking written comments on its five-year review of the nomination for Hudson Canyon National Marine Sanctuary (NMS). Comments should focus solely on any new and relevant information relating to NOAA's 11 sanctuary nomination evaluation criteria. NOAA will pay particular attention to any additional details about the significance of the area's natural or cultural resources, changes to any threats to these resources, and evolving management efforts, or human uses in the proposed area (e.g., wind energy proposals in the area). NOAA will make a final determination on whether the Hudson Canyon NMS nomination remains relevant and responsive to the evaluation criteria after it analyzes the comments it receives and, if so, whether Hudson Canyon NMS is to remain in the nomination inventory for another five-year period. With this five-year review, NOAA is not seeking comments on whether to start the sanctuary designation process for the Hudson Canyon NMS proposal.
