# Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Miscellaneous Refrigeration Products

## Summary

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended ("EPCA"), prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment, including miscellaneous refrigeration products. EPCA also requires the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") to periodically determine whether more stringent, standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would result in significant energy savings. In this notice of proposed rulemaking ("NOPR"), DOE proposes amended energy conservation standards for miscellaneous refrigeration products, and also announces a public meeting to receive comment on these proposed standards and associated analyses and results.
