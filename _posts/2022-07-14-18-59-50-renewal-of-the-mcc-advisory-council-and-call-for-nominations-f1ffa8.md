## Summary

In accordance with the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, MCC has renewed the charter for the MCC Advisory Council ("Advisory Council") and is hereby soliciting representative nominations for the 2022-2024 term. The Advisory Council serves MCC in an advisory capacity only and provides insight regarding innovations in relevant sectors including technology, agriculture, land management, infrastructure, environment, climate, blended finance, public finance, health, water and sanitation, energy, gender, and social inclusion; perceived risks and opportunities in MCC partner countries; and evolving approaches to working in developing country contexts. The Advisory Council provides a platform for systematic engagement with the private sector and contributes to MCC's mission--to reduce poverty through sustainable, economic growth. MCC uses this advice, information, and recommendations to inform compact development and implementation, and broaden public and private sector partnerships for more impact and leverage. The MCC Vice President of the Department of Compact Operations affirms that the Advisory Council is necessary and in the public interest. The Advisory Council is seeking members representing a diverse group of private sector organizations with expertise in the aforementioned sectors particularly in the countries and regions where MCC operates.
