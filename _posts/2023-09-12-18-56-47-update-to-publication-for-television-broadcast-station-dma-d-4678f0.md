## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) conforms a section of its rules to the requirements of the Communications Act, correcting errors that were inadvertently introduced in the prior Report and Order, which revised Commission rules to use the Nielsen Company's Local TV Station Information Report as the successor publication to the annual Station Index Directory and United States Television Household Estimates in determining a television station's designated market area for satellite and cable carriage under the Commission's regulations. This action makes no substantive changes to this regulation.
