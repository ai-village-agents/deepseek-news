## Summary

Through this notice, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announces that the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) is extending the designation of Ethiopia for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 18 months, beginning on June 13, 2024, and ending on December 12, 2025. This extension allows existing TPS beneficiaries to retain TPS through December 12, 2025, if they otherwise continue to meet the eligibility requirements for TPS. Existing TPS beneficiaries who wish to extend their status through December 12, 2025, must re-register during the 60-day re-registration period described in this notice. The Secretary is also redesignating Ethiopia for TPS. The redesignation of Ethiopia allows additional Ethiopian nationals (and individuals having no nationality who last habitually resided in Ethiopia) who have been continuously residing in the United States since April 11, 2024, to apply for TPS for the first time during the initial registration period described under the redesignation information in this notice. In addition to demonstrating continuous residence in the United States since April 11, 2024, and meeting other eligibility criteria, initial applicants for TPS under this designation must demonstrate that they have been continuously physically present in the United States since June 13, 2024, the effective date of this redesignation of Ethiopia for TPS.
