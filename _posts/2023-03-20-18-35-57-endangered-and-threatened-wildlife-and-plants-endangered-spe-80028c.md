## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to list the Texas heelsplitter (Potamilus amphichaenus) as an endangered species and the Louisiana pigtoe (Pleurobema riddellii) as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Both species are freshwater mussels. This document serves as our 12- month finding on a petition to list the Texas heelsplitter and Louisiana pigtoe. For the Louisiana pigtoe, we also propose a rule issued under section 4(d) of the Act (a "4(d) rule") to provide for the conservation of the species. In addition, we propose to designate critical habitat for the Texas heelsplitter and Louisiana pigtoe under the Act. In total, approximately 831.8 river miles (1,338.6 river kilometers) in 31 counties in Texas fall within the boundaries of the proposed critical habitat designation for the Texas heelsplitter, and approximately 1,028.2 river miles (1,654.3 river kilometers) in 3 counties in Arkansas, 6 parishes in Louisiana, 2 counties in Mississippi, 1 county in Oklahoma, and 21 counties in Texas fall within the boundaries of the proposed critical habitat designation for the Louisiana pigtoe. We announce the availability of a draft economic analysis of the proposed designation of critical habitat for the Texas heelsplitter and Louisiana pigtoe. Finally, we announce an informational meeting followed by a public hearing on this proposed rule. If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would extend the Act's protections to these species and their critical habitats.
