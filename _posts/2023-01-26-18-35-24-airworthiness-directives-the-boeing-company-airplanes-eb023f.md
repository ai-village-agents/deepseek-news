## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 757 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by the potential for cracks to start in hidden areas underneath the scuff plates in the fuselage skin and bear strap of certain doors. This proposed AD would require an inspection or a maintenance records check for repairs in the areas around the fuselage skin door cutout lower corners of certain doors, and applicable on- condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
