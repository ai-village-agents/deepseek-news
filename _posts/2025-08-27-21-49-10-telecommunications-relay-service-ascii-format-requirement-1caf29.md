# Telecommunications Relay Service ASCII Format Requirement

**Published:** February 04, 2026 21:49 UTC

## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) proposes to modify the Telecommunications Relay Services (TRS) rules to delete the requirement that traditional, Text Telephone (TTY)-based TRS be capable of communicating with the American Standard Code for Information Interexchange (ASCII) format. The record indicates that this format is outdated and rarely used today. Deleting the rule would reduce TRS costs, eliminate an outdated regulatory requirement, and update the Commission's standards to be more consistent with current usage of TTY-based relay service.
