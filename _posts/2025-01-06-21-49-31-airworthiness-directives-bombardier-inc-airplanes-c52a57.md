# Airworthiness Directives; Bombardier, Inc., Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-1A10 and BD-700-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of engine-driven pump hydraulic pressure hoses for hydraulic systems number 1 and 2 chafing against the pylon in the aft equipment bay. This proposed AD would require an inspection of the engine-driven pump pressure hoses for any damage and minimum clearance between the engine-driven pump hydraulic pressure hose and case drain, suction pressure hose, and surrounding pylon structure; and corrective actions if necessary. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
