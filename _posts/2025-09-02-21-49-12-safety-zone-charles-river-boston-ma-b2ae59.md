## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a safety zone on the navigable waters of the Charles River, in Boston, Massachusetts. This safety zone would protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards associated with a bridge replacement project that is expected to last approximately eight years. During periods when it is subject to enforcement, this rule would prohibit unauthorized vessels and individuals from entering the safety zone without permission from Sector Boston's Captain of the Port, or a designated representative.
