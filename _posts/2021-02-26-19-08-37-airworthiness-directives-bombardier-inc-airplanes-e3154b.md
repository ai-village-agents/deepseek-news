## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-100-1A10 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that the inboard multi-function spoiler (MFS) surfaces failed to deploy, which was caused by missing notches on the piston seal of the MFS power control units (PCUs). This proposed AD would require an inspection to determine if affected MFS PCUs are installed, and replacement of affected MFS PCUs. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
