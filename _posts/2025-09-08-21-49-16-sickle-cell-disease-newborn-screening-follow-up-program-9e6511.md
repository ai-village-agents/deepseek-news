## Summary

HRSA will provide $65,500 in supplemental award funds to each of the 25 Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) Newborn Screening Follow-Up Program (NBS FP) grantees under HRSA-21-036 in fiscal year (FY) 2025, totaling $1,637,500. The FY 2025 supplemental funds will support grant activities that are in scope of program goals and objectives. The supplemental funding can support activities related to: increasing access to medical and support services, particularly during the pediatric to adult transition period; improving data systems; increasing workforce training and knowledge; expanding quality improvement projects; or conducting outreach to help identify individuals living with SCD who have been lost to follow-up. These activities will strengthen the linkage of individuals with SCD to appropriate and ongoing care to improve health outcomes.
