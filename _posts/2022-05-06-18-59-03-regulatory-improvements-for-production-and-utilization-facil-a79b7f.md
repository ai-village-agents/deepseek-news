## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is correcting a proposed rule that was published in the Federal Register on March 3, 2022. The proposed rule would amend the NRC's regulations that relate to the decommissioning of production and utilization facilities to maintain a safe, effective, and efficient decommissioning process; reduce the need for license amendment requests and exemptions from existing regulations; address other decommissioning issues deemed relevant by the NRC; and support the NRC's Principles of Good Regulation. This action is necessary to correct a reference.
