## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Leonardo S.p.A. Model AW169 helicopters. This proposed AD would require modifying the weight on wheels (WoW) support installation on the main landing gear (MLG). This proposed AD is prompted by a report that an inappropriately tightened WoW support could result in a rotation of the support and improper WoW switch performance. The actions of this proposed AD are intended to correct an unsafe condition on these products.
