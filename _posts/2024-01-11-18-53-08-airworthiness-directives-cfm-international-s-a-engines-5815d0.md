## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for CFM International (CFM) Model LEAP-1A23, LEAP-1A24, LEAP-1A24E1, LEAP-1A26, LEAP-1A26CJ, LEAP-1A26E1, LEAP-1A29, LEAP-1A29CJ, LEAP-1A30, LEAP-1A32, LEAP-1A33, LEAP-1A33B2, and LEAP-1A35A engines. This proposed AD was prompted by detection of melt-related freckles in the billet, which may reduce the life of certain high-pressure turbine (HPT) rotor interstage seals. This proposed AD would require removing the affected HPT rotor interstage seals from service and replacing with a part eligible for installation. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
