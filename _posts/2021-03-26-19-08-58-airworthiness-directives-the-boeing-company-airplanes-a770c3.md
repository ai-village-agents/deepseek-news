## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 777 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by significant changes, including new or more restrictive requirements, made to the airworthiness limitations (AWLs) and Critical Design Configuration Control Limitations (CDCCLs) related to fuel tank ignition prevention, the engine fuel suction feed system, and the nitrogen generation system. This proposed AD would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
