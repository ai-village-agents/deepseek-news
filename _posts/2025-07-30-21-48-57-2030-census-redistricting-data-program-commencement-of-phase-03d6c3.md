## Summary

This notice announces the commencement of Phase 1 of the 2030 Census Redistricting Data Program: The Block Boundary Suggestion Project. Phase 1 specifically provides states the opportunity to supply the Census Bureau with their suggestions for the 2030 Census tabulation block inventory. Suggestions are made by designating the desirability of linear features for use as 2030 Census tabulation block boundaries. In addition, states have the opportunity to submit to the Census Bureau suggested legal boundary updates. These actions allow states to construct some of the small area geography they need for legislative redistricting. State participation in Phase 1 of the 2030 Census Redistricting Data Program is voluntary.
