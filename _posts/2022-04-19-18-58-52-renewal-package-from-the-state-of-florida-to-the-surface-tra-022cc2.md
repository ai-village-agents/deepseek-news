## Summary

This notice announces that FHWA has received and reviewed a renewal package from the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) requesting renewed participation in the Surface Transportation Project Delivery Program (Program). This Program allows for FHWA to assign, and States to assume, responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and all or part of FHWA's responsibilities for environmental review, consultation, or other actions required under any Federal environmental law with respect to one or more Federal highway projects within the State. The FHWA determined the renewal package to be complete and developed a draft renewal MOU with FDOT outlining how the State will implement the Program with FHWA oversight. The public is invited to comment on FDOT's request, including its renewal package and the proposed renewal MOU, which includes the proposed assignments and assumptions of environmental review, consultation and other activities.
