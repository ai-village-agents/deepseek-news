## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2000-17-09, AD 2008-04-19 R1, and AD 2015-26-09; and to terminate all requirements of AD 2018-18-05, which applies to ATR--GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42-200, -300, and -320 airplanes. AD 2018-18-05 requires updating the maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive maintenance requirements and airworthiness limitations and terminates the relevant requirements of AD 2000-17-09, AD 2008-04-19 R1, and AD 2015-26-09. Since AD 2018-18-05 was issued, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which will be incorporated by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
