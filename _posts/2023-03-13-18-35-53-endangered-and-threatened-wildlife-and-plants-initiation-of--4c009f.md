We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, are conducting a 5- year status review of the Mexican wolf under the Endangered Species Act. A 5-year status review is based on the best scientific and commercial data available at the time of the review; therefore, we are requesting submission of any such information that has become available since the last review for the species.
