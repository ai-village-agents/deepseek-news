## Summary

The Rural Utilities Service (RUS or the Agency), a Rural Development (RD) agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), announced its intent to solicit Letters of Interest (LOI) for applications under the Empowering Rural America (New ERA) Program in a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) on May 16, 2023, in the Federal Register. In addition, the NOFO announced the eligibility requirements, application process and deadlines, and the criteria that RUS will use to assess New ERA Applications. This notice is making corrections and amendments to clarify timelines for application submission, ensure applicants know they are required to establish a Verified eAuthentication ID, inform applicants that they are eligible for the New ERA Program even if they are subject to a "cooling off period" under the Rural Electrification Act, and to notify applicants that the Agency will provide general assistance to applicants through the RUS' General Field Representatives (GFRs) prior to LOI submissions.
