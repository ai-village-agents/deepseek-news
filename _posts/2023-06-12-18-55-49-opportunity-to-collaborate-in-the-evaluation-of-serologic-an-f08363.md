## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), announces an opportunity for industry and the public to collaborate on a project to evaluate nucleic acid and serologic tests. CDC is interested in evaluating serologic and nucleic acid tests that can be used to aid in the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection, including serologic tests that can secondarily differentiate recent infection, and nucleic acid tests for the quantitation or semi-quantitation of HIV RNA. Tests of interest include those that use whole blood, serum, plasma, or dried blood spots. Performance will be evaluated relative to Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved qualitative and quantitative nucleic acid tests as well as serologic immunoassays. More than one collaborator may be selected.
