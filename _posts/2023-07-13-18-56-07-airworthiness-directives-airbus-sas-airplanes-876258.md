## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-07-05, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2019-07-05 requires repetitive inspections for cracking of the 10VU rack fitting lugs and repair of any cracking. Since the FAA issued AD 2019-07-05, it was determined that certain repetitive inspection intervals need to be revised. This proposed AD would retain the requirements of AD 2019-07-05, with reduced compliance times and would remove airplanes having a certain modification from the applicability. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
