## Summary

This proposed rule would amend regulations of the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to set forth the reporting requirements for the BE-13, Survey of New Foreign Direct Investment in the United States ("BE-13 survey"). The BE-13 survey collects information on the acquisition or establishment of U.S. business enterprises by foreign investors, and information on expansions by existing U.S. affiliates of foreign companies. The data collected through the survey are used to measure the amount of new foreign direct investment in the United States and ensure complete coverage of BEA's other foreign direct investment statistics. BEA proposes one change to the reporting requirements of the survey that will reduce respondent burden, simplify reporting, and increase the efficiency of the data collection. This mandatory BE-13 survey is required from persons subject to the reporting requirements, whether or not they are contacted by BEA.
