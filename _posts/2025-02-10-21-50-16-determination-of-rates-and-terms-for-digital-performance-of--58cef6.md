## Summary

On December 19, 2024, the Copyright Royalty Judges published for comment proposed regulations governing the rates and terms for the digital performances of sound recordings by new subscription services and for the making of ephemeral recordings necessary to facilitate those transmissions for the period commencing January 1, 2026, and ending on December 31, 2030. That document omitted certain parentheses in the rate adjustment formulas, leaving the parentheses in those formulas unbalanced. This document corrects those formulas.
