## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for various airplanes modified with certain configurations of Garmin G3X Touch Electronic Flight Instrument System installed per Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) No. SA01899WI or Garmin GI 275 Multi-Function Display (MFD) installed per STC No. SA02658SE. This AD was prompted by a report of a fuel quantity disparity between the amount of fuel indicated and the actual amount of fuel. This AD requires modifying the resistive fuel probe interface. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
