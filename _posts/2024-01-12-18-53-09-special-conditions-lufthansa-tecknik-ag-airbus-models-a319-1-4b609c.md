## Summary

These special conditions are issued for the Airbus Model A319- 133 and A321-200 series airplanes. These airplanes, as modified by Lufthansa Tecknik AG (Lufthansa), will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport category airplanes. This design feature is the installation of an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system based on supercapacitor technology. The current airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
