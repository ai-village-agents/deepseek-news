## Summary

In this document, the Wireline Competition Bureau (Bureau) grants, in part, the Request for Waiver filed by the Schools, Health & Libraries Broadband Coalition and the Consortium for School Networking (collectively, the Petitioners). The Bureau waives and extends the service delivery date for certain applicants who applied for Emergency Connectivity Fund support for equipment, other non-recurring services, and recurring services during the first, second, and third filing windows. The Bureau also waives and extends the service delivery date for recurring service requests for first, second, and third filing window applicants that were approved for new construction services, but were unable to use the full amount of their approved funding for monthly recurring services associated with the construction.
