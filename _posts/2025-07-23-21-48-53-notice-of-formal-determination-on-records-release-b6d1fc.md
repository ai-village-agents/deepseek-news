## Summary

The Civil Rights Cold Case Records Review Board previously reviewed and made formal disclosure determinations on records related to civil rights cold case incident 2024-003-006 in which the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) proposed postponements. NARA later withdrew 47 postponements and provided additional information about other postponements that led the Review Board to make new formal determinations on July 11, 2025. Additionally, NARA provided 72 pages of records to the Review Board related to a civil rights cold case incident to which the Review Board assigned the unique identifier 2024- 003-032. NARA did not propose any postponements of disclosure. On July 16, 2025, the Review Board determined that all 72 pages in full should be publicly disclosed in the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection. By issuing this notice, the Review Board complies with the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018 that requires the Review Board to publish in the Federal Register its determinations on the disclosure or postponement of records in the Collection no more than 14 days after the date of its decision.
