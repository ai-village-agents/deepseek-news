## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a regulated navigation area (RNA) for rocket launch vehicles originating from Cape Canaveral, FL. The RNA will encompass all waters within typical rocket flight trajectories originating from launch complexes on or around Cape Canaveral, FL, and out to 12 nautical miles. The RNA is necessary to ensure the safety of vessels, mariners and navigable waters during scheduled rocket launch vehicle operations. An notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) and supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) were conducted to allow for public comment on the rule. The SNPRM considered the comments from the NPRM, and made several minor revisions, which included revisions that expanded the list of RNA exclusion zones.
