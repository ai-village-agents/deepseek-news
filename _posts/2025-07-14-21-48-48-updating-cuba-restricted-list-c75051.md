## Summary

The Department of State is adding seven Cuban military- controlled hotels to the List of Restricted Entities and Sub entities Associated With Cuba (Cuba Restricted List or CRL) identifying entities and sub entities under the control of, or acting for or on behalf of, the Cuban military, intelligence, or security services or personnel with which direct financial transactions would disproportionately benefit such services or personnel at the expense of the Cuban people or private enterprise in Cuba. The Cuban Assets Control Regulations generally prohibit a person subject to U.S. jurisdiction from having direct financial transactions with the entities and sub entities on the CRL. The Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security generally will deny applications to export or reexport items for use by entities or sub entities on the CRL.
