# Energy Conservation Standards for Manufactured Housing

## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is publishing this rule to amend the compliance date for its manufactured housing energy conservation standards. Previously, manufacturers had to comply with these standards on and after July 1, 2025, for Tier 2 homes and 60 days after the issuance of enforcement procedures for Tier 1 homes. DOE is delaying the Tier 2 compliance date to allow DOE more time to consider the proposed enforcement procedures and comments submitted, and to evaluate appropriate next steps that provide clarity for manufacturers and other stakeholders.
