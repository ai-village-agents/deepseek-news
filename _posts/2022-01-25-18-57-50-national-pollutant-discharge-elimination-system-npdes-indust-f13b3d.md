## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is seeking public input on updating the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Industrial Stormwater Fact Sheet Series (hereinafter referred to as "the fact sheets"). EPA's industrial stormwater program has 29 fact sheets currently posted online for each sector covered under the 2021 Multi-Sector General Permit (MSGP) for stormwater discharges from industrial activity. Each fact sheet describes the types of facilities included in the sector, typical stormwater pollutants associated with the sector, and types of stormwater control measures (SCMs) that may be used to minimize the discharge of the pollutants. EPA is seeking public input on the fact sheets, particularly focused on updating: Common activities, pollutant sources, and associated pollutants at facilities in each sector; and SCMs or best management practices (BMPs), including source control and good housekeeping/pollution prevention measures for potential pollutant sources at facilities in each sector. In updating the fact sheets, EPA will consider input received in response to this notice as well as any relevant comments related to the content of the fact sheets that the Agency received during the public comment period for the proposed 2021 MSGP. The fact sheets can be found in the docket and at https:// www.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater-discharges-industrial-activities-fact- sheets-and-guidance.
