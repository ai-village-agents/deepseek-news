## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing five temporary safety zones for the safe splashdown and recovery of reentry vehicles launched by Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX) in support of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) missions through December 31, 2022. The temporary safety zones are located within the Seventh Coast Guard District area of responsibility (AOR) offshore of Jacksonville, Daytona, Cape Canaveral, Tampa, and Tallahassee, Florida. This rule implements a special activities provision of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. This action is necessary to protect vessels and waterway users from the potential hazards created by reentry vehicle splashdowns and recovery operations in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). It is also necessary to provide for the safe recovery of reentry vehicles, and any personnel involved in reentry services, after the splashdown. This rule prohibits U.S.-flagged vessels from entering any of the temporary safety zones unless authorized by the District Commander of the Seventh Coast Guard District or a designated representative.
