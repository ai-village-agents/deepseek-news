In addition, the proposed regulations describe rules related to an IRS pre-filing registration process that would be required. These proposed regulations affect tax-exempt organizations, State and local governments, Indian tribal governments, Alaska Native Corporations, the Tennessee Valley Authority, rural electric cooperatives, and, in the case of three of these credits, certain taxpayers eligible to elect the elective payment of credit amounts in a taxable year. This document also provides notice of a public hearing on the proposed regulations.
