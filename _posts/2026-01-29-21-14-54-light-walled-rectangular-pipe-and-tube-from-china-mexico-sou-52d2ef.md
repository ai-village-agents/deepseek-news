## Summary

The Commission hereby gives notice of the scheduling of full reviews pursuant to the Tariff Act of 1930 to determine whether revocation of the countervailing duty order on light-walled rectangular pipe and tube from China and the antidumping duty orders on light- walled rectangular pipe and tube from China, Mexico, South Korea, and Turkey would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury within a reasonably foreseeable time. The Commission has determined to exercise its authority to extend the review period by up to 90 days. Additionally, due to the lapse in appropriations and ensuing cessation of Commission operations, the Commission tolled its schedule for this proceeding.
