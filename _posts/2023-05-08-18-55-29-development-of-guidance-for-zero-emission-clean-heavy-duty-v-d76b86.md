## Summary

To support development of potentially multiple funding programs under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, EPA invites public comment to inform the availability of zero-emission technologies in the heavy-duty vehicle and port sectors. Although EPA already has considerable information about the availability of certain types of these technologies, in order to ensure that EPA has the most comprehensive and current information available in this dynamic space, EPA is inviting this comment. EPA is especially interested in comments detailing the availability, market price, and performance of zero- emission trucks, zero-emission port equipment, electric charging and other fueling infrastructure needs for zero-emission technologies in the near term (1-3 years, and 1-5 years for port equipment), and whether the components of these systems are manufactured in the United States. The Build America Buy America Act (BABA) requires iron, steel, manufactured products, and construction materials used in infrastructure projects funded by federal financial assistance to be produced in the United States. While BABA provides the opportunity for EPA to issue certain waivers to these requirements, approval depends on many factors, including the price and availability of domestically sourced materials and products. With responses to this RFI EPA seeks to improve in particular the Agency's understanding of availability and differences in zero-emission class 6 and 7 trucks, zero-emission trucks that serve ports and port equipment as well as their related charging and fueling infrastructure requirements. This information will enable EPA to effectively design programs to expeditiously fund currently available zero-emission technologies as well as consider allowances, such as longer project timeframes, for specific technologies.
