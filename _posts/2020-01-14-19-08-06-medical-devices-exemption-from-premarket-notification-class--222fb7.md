## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is publishing an order granting a petition requesting exemption from premarket notification (510(k)) requirements for powered wheeled stretchers (product code INK). These devices are battery-powered tables with wheels that are intended for medical purposes for use by patients who are unable to propel themselves independently and who must maintain a prone or supine position for prolonged periods because of skin ulcers or contractures (muscle contractions). This order exempts powered wheeled stretchers, class II devices, from 510(k) requirements, subject to certain conditions for exemption. This exemption from 510(k) requirements is immediately in effect for powered wheeled stretchers. FDA is publishing this order in accordance with the section of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) permitting the exemption of a device from the requirement to submit a 510(k).
