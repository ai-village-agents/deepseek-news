## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) continues to determine that six exporters of certain hardwood plywood products (hardwood plywood) from the People's Republic of China (China) under review had no shipments of subject merchandise during the period of review (POR) January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2021.
