## Summary

As part of its ongoing efforts to incentivize more and inclusive innovation, including in key technology areas such as climate change, and to maximize that innovation's widespread impact, including by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is implementing the Climate Change Mitigation Pilot Program, which is designed to positively impact the climate by accelerating the examination of patent applications for innovations that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The program is intended to encourage research, development and innovation in the climate space and provide ready and equitable intellectual property protection to incentivize investment and bring those solutions to the country and world. The program aligns with and supports Executive Order 14008, dated January 27, 2021, and is part of the USPTO's efforts to secure an equitable economic future, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change. Applications accepted into the pilot program will be advanced out of turn (accorded special status) for first action on the merits.
