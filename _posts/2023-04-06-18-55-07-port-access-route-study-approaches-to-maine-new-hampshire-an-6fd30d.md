## Summary

The First Coast Guard District announces the completion of the Approaches to Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts Port Access Route Study (MNMPARS). This study was conducted to evaluate the adequacy of existing vessel routing measures and determine whether additional vessel routing measures are necessary for port approaches to Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts and international and domestic transit areas in the First Coast Guard District area of responsibility. The MNMPARS considered whether routing measure revisions were necessary to improve navigation safety due to several factors such as planned or potential offshore development, current port capabilities and planned improvements, increased vessel traffic, changing vessel traffic patterns, weather, or navigational difficulty. The MNMPARS final report is available for viewing and download from the Federal Register docket at http://www.regulations.gov or at the Coast Guard Navigation Center (NAVCEN) website at https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/port-access-route- study-reports. The recommendations of this study may lead to future rulemakings or appropriate international agreements.
