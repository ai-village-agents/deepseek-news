## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is proposing to amend the device current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements of the Quality System (QS) Regulation to align more closely with the international consensus standard for devices by converging with the quality management system (QMS) requirements used by other regulatory authorities from other jurisdictions (i.e., other countries). We propose to do so through incorporating by reference an international standard specific for device quality management systems set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the 2016 edition of ISO 13485 (ISO 13485). Through this rulemaking we also propose additional requirements to align with existing requirements in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and its implementing regulations, and make conforming edits to the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) to clarify the device CGMP requirements for combination products. This action, if finalized, will continue our efforts to align our regulatory framework with that used by other regulatory authorities to promote consistency in the regulation of devices and provide timelier introduction of safe, effective, high- quality devices for patients.
