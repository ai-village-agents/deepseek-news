## Summary

In this document, the International, Public Safety and Homeland Security, Media, and Wireless Telecommunications Bureaus (Bureaus) announce a 180-day freeze, effective September 19, 2022 on the filing of new or modification applications for licenses or other authorizations in the 12.7-12.75 GHz and 12.75-13.250 GHz bands (collectively, 12.7 GHz band).
