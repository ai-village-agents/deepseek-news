## Summary

Notice is hereby given that the NMFS made a determination on the Tribal Resource Management Plan (Tribal Plan) submitted by the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission (NWIFC) on behalf of the Northwest Indian Tribes; the submission fulfills the Tribes' obligations under the protective regulations promulgated for Puget Sound (PS) Chinook salmon, Hood Canal summer-run (HCS) chum salmon, PS steelhead, and Southern (S) eulachon under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The Tribal Plan describes research and assessment activities that may affect listed PS Chinook salmon, HCS chum salmon, PS steelhead, and S eulachon in Washington State. The research included in the Tribal plan is intended to increase knowledge of species listed under the ESA and to help guide management and conservation efforts. NMFS completed a proposed evaluation of how well the Tribal Plan fulfills ESA criteria, and the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) made the proposed evaluation available for public comment.
