## Summary

This action amends the Class E airspace at Hannibal, MO; Monroe City, MO; and Monticello, MO. This action is the result of airspace reviews conducted as part of the decommissioning of the Quincy very high frequency (VHF) omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimal Operational Network (MON) Program. The name of CPT Ben Smith Airfield-Monroe City Airport, Monroe City, MO, is also being updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
