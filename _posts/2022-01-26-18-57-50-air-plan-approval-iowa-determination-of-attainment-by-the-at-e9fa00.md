## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to determine that the Muscatine sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) nonattainment area attained the 2010 1- hour SO<INF>2</INF> primary national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) by the applicable attainment date of October 4, 2018, based upon a weight-of-evidence analysis using available air quality information. Additional analysis of the attainment determination is provided in a Technical Support Document (TSD) included in the docket to this proposed rulemaking. This action, if finalized, will address the EPA's obligation under a consent decree which establishes a deadline of March 31, 2022 for the EPA to determine under Clean Air Act (CAA) section 179(c) whether the Muscatine SO<INF>2</INF> nonattainment area attained the NAAQS by the October 4, 2018 attainment date.
