## Summary

Aliens who are subject to alien registration requirements of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended ("INA") who have not yet registered may use this registration form to satisfy their statutory obligations. This IFR also amends DHS regulations to designate additional documentation that may serve as evidence of alien registration.
