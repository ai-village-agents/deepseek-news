## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its regulations to incorporate by reference proposed revisions of three regulatory guides, which would approve new, revised, and reaffirmed Code Cases published by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. The NRC is also incorporating by reference one NRC NUREG associated with a proposed condition on one of the regulatory guides. This proposed action would allow nuclear power plant licensees, and applicants for construction permits, operating licenses, combined licenses, standard design certifications, standard design approvals and manufacturing licenses, to use the Code Cases listed in these draft regulatory guides as voluntary alternatives to engineering standards for the construction, inservice inspection, and inservice testing of nuclear power plant components. The NRC is requesting comments on this proposed rule and on the draft versions of the three regulatory guides proposed to be incorporated by reference. The NRC is also making available a related draft regulatory guide that lists Code Cases that the NRC has not approved for use. This draft regulatory guide will not be incorporated by reference into the NRC's regulations.
