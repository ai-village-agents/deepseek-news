## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A300 B4-600, B4-600R, and F4-600R series airplanes, and Model A300 C4-605R Variant F airplanes (collectively called Model A300-600 series airplanes), and A310 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that a new airworthiness limitation is necessary. This AD requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate a new airworthiness limitation, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
