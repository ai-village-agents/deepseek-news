# Food Labeling: Front-of-Package Nutrition Information

## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) proposes to require front-of-package nutrition labels on most foods that must bear a Nutrition Facts label. This action, if finalized, would require the display of a compact informational box containing certain nutrient information on the principal display panel. The box would provide consumers, including those who have lower nutrition knowledge, with standardized, interpretive nutrition information that can help them quickly and easily identify how foods can be part of a healthy diet. We also propose to amend certain nutrient content claim regulations to align with current nutrition science and avoid within-label inconsistencies.
