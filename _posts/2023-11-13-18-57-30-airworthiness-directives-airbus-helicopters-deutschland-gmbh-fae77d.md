## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (AHD) Model EC135P1, EC135P2, EC135P2+, EC135P3, EC135T1, EC135T2, EC135T2+, EC135T3, MBB-BK 117 C-2, MBB-BK 117 D-2, and MBB-BK 117 D-3 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by the determination that Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) screens obstruct the pilot's view. This proposed AD would require removing certain part-numbered IFR screens, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. This proposed AD would also prohibit installing those IFR screens on any helicopter. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
