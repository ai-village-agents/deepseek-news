## Summary

In accordance with the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to redesignate the West Virginia portion of the Steubenville, Ohio-West Virginia multi-state sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) nonattainment area (referred to as the "Steubenville Nonattainment Area" or the "Area") from nonattainment to attainment. EPA is also proposing to approve West Virginia's maintenance plan for its portion of the Steubenville Nonattainment Area. Emissions of SO<INF>2</INF> in the Area have been reduced and ambient SO<INF>2</INF> readings in the nonattainment area are currently well below the 2010 1-hour SO<INF>2</INF> national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS).
