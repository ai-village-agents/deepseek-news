## Summary

On November 1, 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) initiated the second sunset reviews of the antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on high pressure steel cylinders (HPSC) from the People's Republic of China (China). Because no domestic interested party responded to the sunset review notice of initiation by the applicable deadline, consistent with the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), Commerce is revoking the AD and CVD orders on HPSC from China.
