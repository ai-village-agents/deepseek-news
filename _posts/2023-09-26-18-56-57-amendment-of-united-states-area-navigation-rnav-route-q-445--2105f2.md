## Summary

This action amends United States Area Navigation (RNAV) route Q-445 by removing segments of the route from the PAACK, NC, waypoint (WP) to the SHAUP, OA, WP (i.e., OA means Offshore Atlantic). This amendment is required because those route segments are unused due to multiple other routes in the same area.
