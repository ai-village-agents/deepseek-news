## Summary

This rule finalizes establishment of the Dairy Donation Program as required by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021. Under the program, eligible dairy organizations that account to a Federal milk marketing order and incur a qualified expense related to certain dairy product donations may apply for and receive reimbursements for those donations. The program facilitates dairy product donations and minimizes food waste. The program works in tandem with the Milk Donation Reimbursement Program, and thus this rule also makes corresponding changes to those regulations.
