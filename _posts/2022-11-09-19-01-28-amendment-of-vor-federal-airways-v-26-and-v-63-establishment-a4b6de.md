## Summary

This action corrects a final rule published by the FAA in the Federal Register on October 31, 2022, that amends VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-26 and V-63; establishes Area Navigation (RNAV) route T-464; and revokes the Wausau, WI, Low Altitude Reporting Point in the vicinity of Wausau, WI. In the new RNAV route T-464, the final rule identified the TONOC, WI, route point as a waypoint (WP), in error. This action makes editorial corrections to the reference of the TONOC, WI, WP to change it to be reflected as a Fix. This correction is necessary to match the FAA National Airspace System Resource (NASR) database information.
