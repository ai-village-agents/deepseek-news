## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; Model A319 series airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, -233, -251N, - 252N, -253N, -271N, -272N, and -273N airplanes; and Model A321 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that certain overheat detection system (OHDS) sensing elements installed at certain positions might not properly detect thermal bleed leak events due to a quality escape during the manufacturing process. This proposed AD would require a one-time detailed inspection of each affected part installed at an affected position and, depending on the findings, replacement; and would prohibit the installation of affected parts at affected positions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
