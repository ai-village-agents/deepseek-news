## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A330-200, A330-200 Freighter, A330-300, A330-800, A330-900, A340-200, and A340-300 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that certain landing gear parts have been manufactured with improper material or using a deviating manufacturing process. This AD requires replacing each affected part with a serviceable part, and for certain airplanes, re-assessing any previously repaired main landing gear (MLG) sliding piston, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also limits the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
