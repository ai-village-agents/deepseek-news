## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is amending the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) to reflect a 2015 court decision regarding the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Stationary Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines (RICE) and the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for Stationary Internal Combustion Engines (ICE). The court vacated provisions in the regulations specifying that emergency engines could operate for emergency demand response or during periods where there is a deviation of voltage or frequency. This ministerial rule revises the RICE NESHAP and ICE NSPS to conform to the court's decision.
