## Summary

This action modifies VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airway V-11. This action is necessary due to the planned decommissioning of the Dyersburg, TN, (DYR); and the Holly Springs, MS (HLI) VOR Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) facilities, under the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program, which provide navigation guidance for segments of the routes. The FAA originally proposed to amend V-7 and V-9 with this rule but these routes require further review and are being delayed to a later date.
