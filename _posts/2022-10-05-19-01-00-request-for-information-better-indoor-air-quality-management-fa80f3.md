## Summary

Through this Request for Information (RFI), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) seeks to promote and advance the widespread adoption of actions that lead to improvements in indoor air quality (IAQ) in the nation's building stock to help mitigate disease transmission (e.g., COVID-19). The agency is announcing a 60-day public comment period to solicit information and recommendations from a broad array of individuals and organizations with knowledge and expertise relating to the built environment and health, indoor air quality, epidemiology, disease transmission, social sciences and other disciplines. EPA will analyze information received from this RFI to consider and support the potential development, improvement, and implementation of technical assistance efforts (e.g., information, tools, training, guidance) and other strategies (e.g., incentives, recognition efforts) to support IAQ related improvements in the nation's building stock, with a particular emphasis on schools and commercial buildings.
