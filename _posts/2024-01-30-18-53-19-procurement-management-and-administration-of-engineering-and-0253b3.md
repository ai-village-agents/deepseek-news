## Summary

This proposed rule would update the regulations governing the procurement, management, and administration of engineering and design related services directly related to a highway construction project that is funded through a discretionary grant administered by FHWA. The intent of the proposed rule is to clarify how the regulations apply to recipients other than State transportation agencies (STA). This proposed rulemaking would also make technical changes and corrections to improve the administration of these regulations.
