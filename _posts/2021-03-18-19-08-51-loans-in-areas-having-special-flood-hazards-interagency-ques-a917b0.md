## Summary

The OCC, Board, FDIC, FCA, and NCUA (collectively, the Agencies) propose to supplement the Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Flood Insurance with new questions and answers regarding the acceptance of flood insurance policies issued by private insurers pursuant to the Agencies' private flood insurance final rule issued in February 2019. These questions and answers will assist lenders in meeting their responsibilities under the final rule and increase public understanding of the Agencies' respective flood insurance regulations. The Agencies solicit comment on all aspects of these new questions and answers.
