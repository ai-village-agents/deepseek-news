## Summary

Through this notice, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announces that the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) is extending the designation of South Sudan for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 18 months, from May 3, 2022, through November 3, 2023, and redesignating South Sudan for 18 months, effective May 3, 2022, through November 3, 2023. The extension allows currently eligible TPS beneficiaries to retain TPS through November 3, 2023, so long as they otherwise continue to meet the eligibility requirements for TPS. The redesignation of South Sudan allows additional individuals who have been continuously residing in the United States since March 1, 2022, to obtain TPS, if otherwise eligible.
