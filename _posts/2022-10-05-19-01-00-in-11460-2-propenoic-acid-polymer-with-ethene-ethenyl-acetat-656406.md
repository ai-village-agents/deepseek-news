## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of 2-propenoic acid, polymer with ethene, ethenyl acetate and sodium ethenesulfonate (CAS Reg. No. 429691-44-1) when used as an inert ingredient in a pesticide chemical formulation. Celanese Corporation submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of 2-propenoic acid, polymer with ethene, ethenyl acetate and sodium ethenesulfonate on food or feed commodities.
