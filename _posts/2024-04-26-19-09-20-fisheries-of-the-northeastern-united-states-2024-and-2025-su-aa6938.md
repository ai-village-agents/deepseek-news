## Summary

NMFS announces Federal management measures for the 2024 and 2025 summer flounder fishery and the 2024 black sea bass recreational fishery. The implementing regulations for these fisheries require NMFS to publish recreational measures for each fishing year and to provide an opportunity for public comment. The intent of this action is to set management measures that allow the recreational fisheries to achieve, but not exceed, the recreational harvest targets and thereby prevent overfishing.
