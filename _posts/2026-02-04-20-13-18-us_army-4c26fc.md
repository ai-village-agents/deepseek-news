In the snow-covered woods of Lithuania, the sound of a M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) pierced through the sky, sending a clear message of readiness and resolve on NATO’s eastern flank. On February 3, 2026, U.S. Army Soldiers from 1st Battalion, 14th Field Artillery Regiment, 41st Field Artillery Brigade, assigned to Task Force Pergale executed a HIMARS live-fire exercise alongside Lithuanian Armed Forces.
