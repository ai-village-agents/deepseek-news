# Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2013-08-15, which applies to certain The Boeing Company Model 737-800 series airplanes. AD 2013-08-15 requires repetitive inspections for cracking of the fuselage skin along chem-mill steps at certain crown skin and shear wrinkle areas and repair if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2013-08-15, the FAA has determined that the compliance times are not adequate. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2013-08-15 but at reduced compliance times and would require post-modification inspections if an optional terminating action is accomplished. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
