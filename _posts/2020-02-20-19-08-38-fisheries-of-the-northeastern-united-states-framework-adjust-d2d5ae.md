## Summary

NMFS proposes to approve and implement Framework Adjustment 32 to the Atlantic Sea Scallop Fishery Management Plan that establishes scallop specifications and other measures for fishing years 2020 and 2021. In addition, Framework 32 would implement measures to protect small scallops and reduce bycatch of flatfish and address regulatory text that is unnecessary, outdated, or unclear consistent with section 305(d) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. This action is necessary to prevent overfishing and improve both yield- per-recruit and the overall management of the Atlantic sea scallop resource.
