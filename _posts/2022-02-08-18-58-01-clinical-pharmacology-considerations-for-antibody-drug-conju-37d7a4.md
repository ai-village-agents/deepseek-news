## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled "Clinical Pharmacology Considerations for Antibody-Drug Conjugates," which provides recommendations for the development of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). Specifically, this guidance addresses the FDA's current thinking regarding clinical pharmacology considerations and recommendations for ADC development programs, including bioanalytical methods, dose selection and adjustment, dose- and exposure-response analysis, intrinsic factors, QTc assessments, immunogenicity, and drug- drug interactions (DDIs). Currently, there are no FDA guidances outlining the clinical pharmacology considerations for antibody-drug conjugates. This draft guidance is not final nor is it in effect at this time.
