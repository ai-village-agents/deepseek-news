## Summary

This action proposes to amend Jet Routes J-19, J-20, J-52, J- 98, J-134, and J-231; amend RNAV route Q-176; amend VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-210, V-234, V-304, V-350, and V-507; and establish Area Navigation (RNAV) routes T-418 and T-431. The FAA is proposing this action due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Liberal, KS, VOR/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) navigational aid (NAVAID). The Liberal VOR is being decommissioned in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
