## Summary

In this document, the Commission adopts changes to its rules to make 100 megahertz of mid-band spectrum in the 3.45-3.55 GHz band available for flexible use. It allocates the 3.45 GHz band to add a co- primary non-Federal fixed and mobile (except aeronautical mobile) allocation and adopted technical, licensing, and competitive bidding rules for this service largely consistent with its rules for other flexible-use wireless spectrum bands. While the majority of incumbent Federal operations in this band will be relocated to alternate spectrum, some operations will continue and must be protected from harmful interference through a system of coordination in specific Cooperative Planning Areas and Periodic Use Areas, described in the Second Report and Order. In addition, the Commission requires non- Federal radiolocation operations in the band to sunset operations within 180 days after the grant of new flexible-use licenses and provides for reimbursement of reasonable relocation costs. Further, the Commission requires amateur operators in the band to cease operations within 90 days of the public notice announcing the close of the auction, while allowing these amateur operations to continue in the 3.3-3.45 GHz band pending future Commission action in that spectrum.
