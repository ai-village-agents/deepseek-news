## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is announcing its determination that the Food Contact Notifications (FCNs) listed in this notice are no longer effective. Several manufacturers notified FDA in writing that they ceased producing, supplying, or using the listed food contact substances (FCSs) for their intended use in the United States. We are taking this action in accordance with the process set out in our regulations, by which FDA may determine that an FCN is no longer effective.
