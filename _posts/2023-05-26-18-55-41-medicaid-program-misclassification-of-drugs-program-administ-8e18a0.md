## Summary

This proposed rule would seek to implement policies in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP) related to the new legislative requirements in the Medicaid Services Investment and Accountability Act of 2019 (MSIAA), which are needed to address drug misclassification, as well as drug pricing and product data misreporting by manufacturers. Additionally, we are proposing several other program integrity and program administration provisions or modifications in this proposed rule including revising and proposing key definitions used in the MDRP. This proposed rule also designates a time limitation on manufacturers initiating audits with States; clarifies and establishes requirements for State fee-for-service (FFS) pharmacy reimbursement; codifies conditions relating to States claiming FFP for physician-administered drugs (PADs); clarifies the requirement of accumulating price concessions when determining best price; designates drug price verification and transparency through data collection; and proposes two new contracting requirements between States and their Medicaid managed care plans. In addition, this rule includes a proposal unrelated to MDRP that would make revisions to the third-party liability regulation due to Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA) of 2018. Finally, we are proposing to rescind revisions made by the December 31, 2020 final rule "Medicaid Program; Establishing Minimum Standards in Medicaid State Drug Utilization Review (DUR) and Supporting Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) for Drugs Covered in Medicaid, Revising Medicaid Drug Rebate and Third Party Liability (TPL) Requirements" to the Determination of Best Price and Determination of Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) sections.
