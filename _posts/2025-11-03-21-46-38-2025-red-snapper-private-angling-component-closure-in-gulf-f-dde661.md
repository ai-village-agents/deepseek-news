## Summary

NMFS announces a closure for the 2025 fishing season for the red snapper private angling component in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off Texas in the Gulf of America (Gulf) through this temporary rule. The red snapper recreational private angling component in the Gulf EEZ off Texas closes on November 21, 2025, until 12:01 a.m., local time, on January 1, 2026. This closure is necessary to prevent the private angling component from exceeding the Texas regional management area annual catch limit (ACL) and to prevent overfishing of the Gulf red snapper resource.
