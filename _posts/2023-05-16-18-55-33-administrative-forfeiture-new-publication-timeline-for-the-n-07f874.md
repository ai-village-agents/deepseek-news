## Summary

This notice announces that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is changing its processes concerning the publication of the Notice of Seizure and Intent to Forfeit for CBP seizures and administrative forfeitures. Currently, CBP neither publishes the Notice of Seizure and Intent to Forfeit online (available at www.forfeiture.gov) nor does it post such a notice, if required, at the appropriate U.S. Customhouse or U.S. Border Patrol Station or Sector office until the administrative process has been exhausted. CBP will now publish the Notice of Seizure and Intent to Forfeit online and, if required, post it at the appropriate U.S. Customhouse or U.S. Border Patrol Station or Sector office at approximately the same time that it first sends a written Notice of Seizure to the party or parties it has identified as potentially having an interest in property seized by CBP. The new publication timeline will make the administrative forfeiture process more efficient without affecting the rights or obligations of any interested party.
