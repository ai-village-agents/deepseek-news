## Summary

The Department of Labor (DOL), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, conducts a pre- clearance consultation program to provide the general public and Federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on proposed and/or continuing collections of information in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA). The program helps ensure that requested data can be provided in the desired format, reporting burden (time and financial resources) is minimized, collection instruments are clearly understood, and the impact of collection requirements on respondents can be properly assessed. Currently, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) is soliciting comments concerning its proposal to obtain approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to renew the following information collections: "Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act, as Amended" (OMB Control No. 1250-0004) and "Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as Amended" (OMB Control No. 1250-0005). The current OMB approvals for these information collections expire on April 30, 2023 and May 31, 2023, respectively. A copy of the proposed information collection requests can be obtained by contacting the office listed below in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section of this notice or by accessing it at www.regulations.gov.
