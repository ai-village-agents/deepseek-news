## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Continental Aerospace Technologies, Inc. (Continental) GTSIO- 520, IO-470, IO-520, IO-550, IOF-550, LIO-470, LIO-520, LTSIO-520, O- 470, TSIO-470, TSIO-520, TSIO-550, TSIOF-550, and TSIOL-550 model reciprocating engines with a certain Superior Air Parts, Inc. (SAP) cylinder assembly or intake valve installed. The affected cylinder assemblies and intake valves are installed as a replacement part under parts manufacturer approval (PMA) on certain affected Continental engines. This AD was prompted by three intake valve failures on reciprocating engines that resulted in engine damage and emergency landing or aborted takeoff. This AD requires replacement of the affected engine intake valve. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
