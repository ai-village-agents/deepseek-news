## Summary

Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974 and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-108, to ensure the system of records notices remain accurate, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff reviews each notice on a periodic basis. As a result of this review, the NRC is republishing 13 of its system of records notices with minor corrective, clarifying, and administrative changes. These minor modifications include updating authorities, system managers, retention schedules, and various other minor updates, as well as edits that are intended to improve clarity of the notices but that are not intended to modify the systems themselves. None of the modifications the NRC is making meet the threshold criteria established by OMB for either a new or altered system of records.
