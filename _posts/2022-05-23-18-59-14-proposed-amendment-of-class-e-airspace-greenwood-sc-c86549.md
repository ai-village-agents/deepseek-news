## Summary

This action proposes to amend Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Greenwood County Airport (GRD) Greenwood, SC, due to the decommissioning of the Coronaca non- directional beacon (NDB) and cancellation of associated approaches, as well as updating the airport's geographic coordinates. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.
