## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for NZSkydive Limited (type certificate previously held by Pacific Aerospace Ltd.) Model FBA-2C1, FBA-2C2, FBA-2C3, and FBA-2C4 airplanes. This AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as a batch of aileron control chain sprockets being manufactured with a non-metallic sleeve insert in the sprocket bore, which can cause cracks to develop and affect the integrity of the aileron control chain sprockets. This AD requires inspecting the sprockets to determine if they have a non-metallic sleeve in the sprocket bore and replacing any sprocket found with a non-metallic sleeve in the sprocket bore with one with a metallic sleeve, and prohibits installation of aileron control chain sprockets with non-metallic sleeves in the sprocket bore. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
