## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is issuing this final rule to update its regulation governing a beneficiary's receipt of education assistance from two or more programs. This action is necessary to implement a statutory amendment enacted in August 2012, which authorized an 81-month aggregate period for use of Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance (Chapter 35) benefits in combination with other programs listed in the statute. This rulemaking amends the regulation to align it with the current statutory text.
