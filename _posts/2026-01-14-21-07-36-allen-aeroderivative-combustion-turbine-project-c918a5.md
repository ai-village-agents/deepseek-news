## Summary

Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has decided to implement the preferred alternative identified in its Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS; Document ID EISX-455-00-000-1730803146) for the construction and operation of six aeroderivative combustion turbine (CT) units at its existing Allen CT facility located in Memphis, Tennessee. Under the preferred alternative, TVA would construct and operate the new units to generate approximately 200 megawatts (MW) of power to provide dispatchable generation to support the continued system load growth experienced in the TVA power service area and increase the flexibility and reliability of TVA's power system by improving TVA's transmission system stability in western Tennessee.
