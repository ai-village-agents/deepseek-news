# Airworthiness Directives; Deutsche Aircraft GmbH (Type Certificate Previously Held by 328 Support Services GmbH; AvCraft Aerospace GmbH; Fairchild Dornier GmbH; Dornier Luftfahrt GmbH) Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Deutsche Aircraft GmbH Model 328-100 and -300 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by operator reports of worn and ruptured bonding straps inside the feeder wing tanks and in both outer and inner wing tanks. This proposed AD would require a one-time detailed inspection of each affected part, and applicable corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
