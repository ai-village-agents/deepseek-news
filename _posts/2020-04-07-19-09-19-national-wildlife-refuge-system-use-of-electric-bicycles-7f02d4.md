## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, have adopted a policy, and we propose to adopt consistent regulations, pertaining to the use of electric bicycles (otherwise known as "e-bikes"). These proposed changes are intended to increase recreational opportunities for all Americans, especially for people with physical limitations. We solicit comments on proposed regulations that will provide guidance and controls for the use of e-bikes on the National Wildlife Refuge System.
