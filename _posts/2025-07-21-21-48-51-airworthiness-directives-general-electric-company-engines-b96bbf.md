## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain General Electric Company (GE) Model CF34-10E2A1, CF34-10E6, CF34-10E6A1, CF34-10E7, CF34-10E7-B, CF34-10E5, and CF34-10E5A1 engines. This AD was prompted by a report of cracks found in the high- pressure turbine (HPT) front rotating air seal. This AD requires performing repetitive fluorescent penetrant inspections (FPIs) to detect indications or linear indications (any indication which is four times longer than the width of that same indication) in the HPT front rotating air seal and, if necessary, replacing the HPT front rotating air seal or HPT rotor disk with parts eligible for installation as applicable. This AD also includes an optional terminating action to the repetitive FPIs. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
