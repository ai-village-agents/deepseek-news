## Summary

The Coast Guard announces that the Chief, Prevention Division, Thirteenth Coast Guard District has issued a certificate of alternative compliance from the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), for the SHAVER, O.N. 1257204, HULL 129. We are issuing this notice because its publication is required by statute. Due to the construction and placement of the mooring and anchor winches and fittings, placement of the sidelights in this area would be a potential hazard to the crew during vessel operations and may subject them to potential damage during mooring. The SHAVER, O.N. 1257204, HULL 129, cannot fully comply with the light, shape, or sound signal provisions of the 72 COLREGS without interfering with the vessel's design and construction. This notification of issuance of a certificate of alternative compliance promotes the Coast Guard's marine safety mission.
