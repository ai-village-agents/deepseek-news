## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all MHI RJ Aviation ULC Model CL-600-2B19 (Regional Jet Series 100 & 440), CL-600-2C10 (Regional Jet Series 700, 701 & 702), CL-600-2C11 (Regional Jet Series 550), CL-600-2D15 (Regional Jet Series 705), CL-600-2D24 (Regional Jet Series 900), and CL-600-2E25 (Regional Jet Series 1000) airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of power control unit (PCU) rod end fractures due to pitting corrosion, and a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD requires, for certain airplanes, revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. This AD also requires accomplishing certain aircraft maintenance manual (AMM) tasks and corrective actions following short-term or long-term storage. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
