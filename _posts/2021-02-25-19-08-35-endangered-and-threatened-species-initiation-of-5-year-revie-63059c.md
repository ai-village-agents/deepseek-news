## Summary

NMFS announces its intent to conduct a 5-year review of the endangered Cook Inlet beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) distinct population segment (DPS). NMFS is required by the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to conduct 5-year reviews to ensure that listing classifications of species are accurate. The 5-year review must be based on the best scientific and commercial data available at the time of the review. We request submission of any such information on the Cook Inlet beluga whale DPS, particularly information on its status, threats, and recovery, that has become available since the previous 5- year review was issued in February 2017.
