## Summary

The Surface Transportation Board (Board) recently completed a reorganization in which it combined its two legal offices, the Office of the General Counsel and the Office of Proceedings, to form the Office of Chief Counsel. The Board is issuing a final rule to make nomenclature changes reflecting the establishment of the Office of Chief Counsel as a result of this reorganization, to remove obsolete references, and to revise its rules to no longer accept paper checks or money orders as a form of payment.
