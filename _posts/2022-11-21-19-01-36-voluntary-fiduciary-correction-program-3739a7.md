## Summary

This document contains an amended and restated Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program (VFC Program or Program) under Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) and a request for comment. The VFC Program is designed to encourage correction of fiduciary breaches by permitting persons to avoid potential Department of Labor (Department) civil enforcement actions and civil penalties if they voluntarily correct eligible transactions in a manner that meets the requirements of the Program. Based on its experience since the last revision of the Program in 2006, the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) has identified certain changes that will both simplify and expand the original VFC Program, thereby making the Program easier for, and more useful to, employers and others who wish to avail themselves of the relief provided by the Program. Specifically, the Program amendments add a self-correction feature, clarify some existing transactions eligible for correction under the Program, expand the scope of other transactions currently eligible for correction, and simplify certain administrative or procedural requirements for participation in and correction of transactions under the VFC Program.
