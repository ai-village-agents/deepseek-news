## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-2A12 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that the flightcrew and passenger oxygen system's refill and capillary lines may have been contaminated by sealant and cotton fibers. This proposed AD would require an inspection to determine the serial numbers of the oxygen cylinders installed and replacement of each affected oxygen cylinder and regulator assembly (OCRA). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
