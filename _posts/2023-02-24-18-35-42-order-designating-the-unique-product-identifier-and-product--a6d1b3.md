## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("Commission") has issued an Order to designate a unique product identifier and product classification system to be used in swap recordkeeping and data reporting.

The Order requires registered entities and swap counterparties to use unique product identifiers issued by the Derivatives Service Bureau Limited for swaps in the credit, equity, foreign exchange, and interest rate asset classes to comply with certain of the Commission's swap recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
