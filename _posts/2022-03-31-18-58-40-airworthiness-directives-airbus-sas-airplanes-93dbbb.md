## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports that passenger door stop screws were found with missing screw heads. This proposed AD would require repetitive inspections of each passenger door stop screw for any missing screw heads and applicable corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
