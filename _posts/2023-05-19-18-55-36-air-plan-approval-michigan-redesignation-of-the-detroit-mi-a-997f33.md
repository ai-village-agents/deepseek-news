## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing its redesignation of the Detroit, Michigan area to attainment for the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) in accordance with a request from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE). EGLE submitted this request on January 3, 2022. EPA is approving, as a revision to the Michigan State Implementation Plan (SIP), the State's plan for maintaining the 2015 ozone NAAQS through 2035 in the Detroit area. EPA is also finding adequate and approving Michigan's 2025 and 2035 volatile organic compound (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) motor vehicle emissions budgets (budgets) for the Detroit area. The Detroit area includes Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, St. Clair, Washtenaw, and Wayne Counties.
