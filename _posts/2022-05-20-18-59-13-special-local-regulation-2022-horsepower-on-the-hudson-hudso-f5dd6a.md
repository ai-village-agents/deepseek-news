## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing temporary special local regulations on certain waters of the Hudson River in the vicinity of Castleton-on-the-Hudson, New York, in support of the Horsepower on the Hudson event on August 6, 2022. This action is necessary to ensure the safety of participants, participant vessels, spectators, and mariners transiting the area from the dangers associated with vessels operating at high-speeds during the Horsepower on the Hudson event. This rulemaking will allow the Coast Guard to enforce vessel movements within three regulated areas and temporarily restrict vessel traffic in a portion of the Hudson River between Hudson River Lighted Buoy 202 (LLNR 38905) to Hudson River Light 204 (LLNR 38910).
