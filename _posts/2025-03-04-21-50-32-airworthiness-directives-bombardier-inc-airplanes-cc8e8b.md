## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-2A12 airplanes. This AD was prompted by the discovery that a partial loss of thrust after an engine failure during a required navigation performance authorization required (RNP- AR) approach under certain weight, altitude and temperature (WAT) conditions, may lead to a descent below the specified path guidance. This AD requires a revision to the existing airplane flight manual (AFM), to incorporate updated WAT tables for RNP-AR approach operations. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
