## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FMCSA announces its plan to submit the information collection request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval. This information collection (IC) is voluntary and may be utilized by medical examiners (ME) responsible for issuing Medical Examiner's Certificates, Form MCSA-5876, to individuals diagnosed with non-insulin-treated diabetes mellitus who operate commercial motor vehicles (CMV) in interstate commerce. MEs choosing to use this IC will do so in an effort to communicate with treating healthcare providers who manage the diabetes care of individuals diagnosed with non-insulin- treated diabetes mellitus who operate CMVs. The information obtained by MEs will assist them in determining whether an individual diagnosed with non-insulin-treated diabetes mellitus meets FMCSA's physical qualification standards. One comment from the public was received in response to the 60-day Federal Register notice.
