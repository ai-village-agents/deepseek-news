## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Leonardo S.p.a. Model A109E, A109S, and AW109SP helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of incorrect installation of the motor (MTR) cables and the bonding braids connected to the engine fire extinguisher bottles. This proposed AD would require inspecting the cables and bonding braids installation and, depending on the results, accomplishing corrective action, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
