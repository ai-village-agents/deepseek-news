## Summary

The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is providing an additional 45 days for public comments on the proposed rule that would amend the Dairy Promotion and Research Order (Dairy Order). The proposed rule would modify the number of National Dairy Promotion and Research Board (Dairy Board) members in 2 of the 12 regions. The total number of domestic Dairy Board members would remain the same at 36. This modification was requested by the Dairy Board, which administers the Dairy Order, to better reflect the geographic distribution of milk production in the United States.
