## Summary

Ford Motor Company (Ford) has petitioned NHTSA for a temporary exemption from certain requirements in seven Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) for vehicles that will be equipped with automated driving systems (ADS). Ford is seeking an exemption from portions of FMVSS No. 101, Controls and Displays; No. 102, Transmission Shift Position Sequence, Starter Interlock, and Transmission Braking Effect; No. 108, Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated Equipment; No. 111, Rear Visibility; No. 126, Electronic Stability Control Systems; No. 135, Light Vehicle Brake Systems; and No. 138, Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems. NHTSA is publishing this document in accordance with statutory and administrative provisions and seeks comment on the merits of Ford's exemption petition and on potential terms and conditions that should be applied to the temporary exemption if granted. After receiving and considering public comments, and any additional information provided by Ford, NHTSA will assess the merits of the petition and will publish a notice in the Federal notice setting forth NHTSA's reasoning for either granting or denying Ford's petition.
