## Summary

As a result of the determinations by the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) orders on certain carbon and alloy steel cut-to-length plate (CTL plate) from Austria, Belgium, the People's Republic of China (China), France, the Federal Republic of Germany (Germany), Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea (Korea), South Africa, Taiwan, and the Republic of Turkey (Turkey) would likely lead to a continuation or recurrence of dumping and material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation of these AD orders. Further, as a result of the ITC's determination that revocation of the AD order on CTL plate from Brazil is not likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is revoking the AD order on CTL plate from Brazil.
