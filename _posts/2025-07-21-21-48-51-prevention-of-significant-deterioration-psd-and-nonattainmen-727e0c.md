## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is withdrawing the proposed rule titled "Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Nonattainment New Source Review (NNSR): Regulations Related to Project Emissions Accounting" that published in the Federal Register on May 3, 2024. Based on comments received, the EPA has determined that there is insufficient justification for the proposed rule revisions to the New Source Review (NSR) program applicability provisions under the Clean Air Act (CAA) and that the proposed revisions could result in unnecessary additional burden on regulated entities and State, Tribal, and local air agencies that implement the NSR regulations.
