## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to grant an exemption to Daimler Trucks North America (Daimler) for nine of its commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers, identified below. Under this exemption, the nine drivers are not subject to the commercial driver's license (CDL) requirements and therefore are exempt from the requirements of the Agency's drug and alcohol regulations. This exemption will permit the Daimler drivers to test-drive Daimler vehicles on U.S. roads to better understand product requirements in "real world" environments, and verify results. FMCSA reviewed the drivers' commercial license records provided by Daimler, and believes the requirements for a German commercial license, the work restrictions imposed on Daimler drivers because of nonimmigrant visa requirements, and the terms and conditions set forth below will ensure that Daimler's operation, under this exemption, will likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to or greater than the level that would be obtained in the absence of the exemption.
