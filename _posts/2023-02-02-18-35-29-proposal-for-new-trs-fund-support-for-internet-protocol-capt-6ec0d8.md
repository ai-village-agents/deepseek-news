## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) proposes to adopt a new three-year plan for Telecommunications Relay Services (TRS) Fund support of internet Protocol Captioned Telephone Service (IP CTS). Based on recent data that allows more reliable assessment of the costs of fully automatic IP CTS, the Commission proposes to apply different formulas for compensating TRS providers for the provision of Communications Assistant (CA)-assisted and automatic speech recognition (ASR)-only IP CTS. The Commission proposes to continue using an average-cost methodology, subject to revised criteria for determining reasonable costs and to annual adjustments based on relevant cost factors.
