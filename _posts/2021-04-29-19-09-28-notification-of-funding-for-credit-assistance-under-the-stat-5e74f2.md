## Summary

In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, signed by the President on December 27, 2020, Congress provided $5 million in budget authority solely for the cost of direct loans or guaranteed loans to state infrastructure financing authority borrowers for projects described in the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014 (WIFIA). The state infrastructure financing authority WIFIA (SWIFIA) program will use this amount to cover the subsidy required to provide a much larger amount of credit assistance. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) estimates that this budget authority may provide approximately $1 billion in credit assistance and may finance approximately $2 billion in water infrastructure investment. The purpose of this NOFA is to solicit letters of interest (LOIs) from prospective state infrastructure financing authority borrowers seeking credit assistance from EPA under the SWIFIA program. EPA will evaluate and select proposed projects described in the LOIs using the selection criteria established in the statute, and further described in this NOFA as well as the WIFIA program handbook. This NOFA explains budgetary scoring factors to determine budgetary scoring compliance and outlines the process that prospective borrowers should follow to be considered for SWIFIA credit assistance. In addition, EPA reserves the right to make additional awards under this announcement, consistent with Agency policy and guidance, if additional funding is available after the original selections are made.
