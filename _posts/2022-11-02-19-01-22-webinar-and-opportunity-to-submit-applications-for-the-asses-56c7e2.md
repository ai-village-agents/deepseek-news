## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is expanding the Recommendations of Specifications, Standards and Ecolabels for Federal Purchasing (Recommendations) and is seeking managers of standards development organizations, ecolabel programs, and associated conformity assessment bodies to apply for potential assessment and inclusion in the Recommendations. Interested applicants should electronically submit responses to the scoping questions. Those considering applying are invited to attend a webinar hosted by the EPA's Environmentally Preferable Purchasing (EPP) Program to learn more and ask questions about the assessment process. Once all applications are received, EPA will issue an estimated timeline for full assessments against Sections I through IV of the Framework for the Assessment of Environmental Performance Standards and Ecolabels for Federal Purchasing (Framework). The number of full assessments that EPA can perform will depend on the number of applicants and available resources.
