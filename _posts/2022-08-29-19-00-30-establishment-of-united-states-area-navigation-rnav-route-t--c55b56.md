## Summary

This action corrects a final rule published by the FAA in the Federal Register on July 14, 2022, that establishes United States Area Navigation (RNAV) route T-381 in the vicinity of Big Lake, AK, in support of a large and comprehensive T-route modernization project for the state of Alaska. The final rule identified the GLOWS, AK, route point as a waypoint (WP), in error. This action makes an editorial correction to the reference of the GLOWS, AK, WP to change it to be reflected as a Fix and match the FAA's aeronautical database information.
