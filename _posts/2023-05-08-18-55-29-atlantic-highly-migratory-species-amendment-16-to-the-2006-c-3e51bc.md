## Summary

NMFS announces the availability of the scoping document for Amendment 16 to the 2006 Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species (HMS) Fishery Management Plan (FMP) (Amendment 16) and its intent to prepare an EIS under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Based on the mechanism used in establishing shark quotas and related management measures from Amendment 14 to the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP (Amendment 14), Amendment 16 would modify the acceptable biological catch (ABC) and annual catch limits (ACLs) for Atlantic sharks and the process used to account for carryover of underharvests of quotas. In the scoping document, NMFS considers changes to commercial and recreational shark management measures related to commercial and recreational quotas, management groups, retention limits, and size limits. NMFS expects to consider the comments received on the scoping document when developing Amendment 16.
