## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is seeking stakeholder comments on the development of a technology and software assessment that examines the feasibility of dispensers with 25 or fewer full-time employees conducting interoperable, electronic tracing of products at the package level. FDA would like to obtain information regarding issues to be addressed in the assessment related to the accessibility of the necessary software and hardware to such dispensers; whether the necessary software and hardware is prohibitively expensive to obtain, install, and maintain for such dispensers; and if the necessary hardware and software can be integrated into business practices.
