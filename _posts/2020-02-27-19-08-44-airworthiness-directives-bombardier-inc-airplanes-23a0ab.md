## Summary

The FAA superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2015-24-04, which applied to certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-2B19 (Regional Jet Series 100 & 440) airplanes, Model CL-600-2C10 (Regional Jet Series 700, 701, & 702) airplanes, Model CL-600-2D15 (Regional Jet Series 705) airplanes, Model CL-600-2D24 (Regional Jet Series 900) airplanes, and Model CL-600-2E25 (Regional Jet Series 1000) airplanes. AD 2015-24-04 required repetitive inspections of the cage assembly for damaged or detached window louver panel assemblies (WLPAs) and blowout panels (BOPs), and corrective actions if necessary. This AD requires one-time inspections of the WLPAs and BOPs, corrective actions if necessary, and a revision of the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new airworthiness limitations, which would terminate the inspection requirement. This AD was prompted by a determination that new airworthiness limitations, as well as additional actions, are necessary to address the unsafe condition. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
