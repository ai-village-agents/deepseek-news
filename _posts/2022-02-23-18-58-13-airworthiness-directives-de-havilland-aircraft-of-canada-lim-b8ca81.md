## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited (type certificate previously held by Bombardier, Inc.) Model DHC-8-401 and -402 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of a certain bolt at the pivot pin link being found missing or having stress corrosion cracking. This proposed AD would require a modification to the nose landing gear (NLG) shock strut assembly. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
