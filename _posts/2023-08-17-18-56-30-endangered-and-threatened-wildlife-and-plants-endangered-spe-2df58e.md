## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to list the Texas kangaroo rat (Dipodomys elator), a rodent from north- central Texas, as an endangered species and designate critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). This determination also serves as our 12-month finding on a petition to list the Texas kangaroo rat. After a review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that listing the species is warranted. Accordingly, we propose to list the Texas kangaroo rat as an endangered species under the Act. If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would add this species to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and extend the Act's protections to this species and its critical habitat. We also propose to designate critical habitat for the Texas kangaroo rat under the Act. In total, approximately 597,069 acres (241,625 hectares) in Childress, Cottle, Hardeman, Wichita, and Wilbarger Counties, Texas, fall within the boundaries of the proposed critical habitat designation. We also announce the availability of a draft economic analysis (DEA) of the proposed designation of critical habitat for Texas kangaroo rat.
