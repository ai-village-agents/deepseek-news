## Summary

We, NMFS, have completed a comprehensive status review under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) for the Atlantic humpback dolphin (Sousa teuszii) in response to a petition from the Animal Welfare Institute, the Center for Biological Diversity, and VIVA Vaquita to list the species. Based on the best scientific and commercial information available, including the draft status review report, and taking into account efforts being made to protect the species, we have determined that the Atlantic humpback dolphin has a high risk of extinction throughout its range and warrants listing as an endangered species. This species occurs only in coastal Atlantic waters of western Africa. We are authorized to designate critical habitat within U.S. jurisdiction only, and we are not aware of any areas within U.S jurisdiction that may meet the definition of critical habitat under the ESA. Therefore, we are not proposing to designate critical habitat. We are soliciting public comments on our draft status review report and proposal to list this species.
