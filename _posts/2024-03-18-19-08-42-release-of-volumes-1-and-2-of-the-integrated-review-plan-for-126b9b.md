## Summary

On or about March 18, 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is making available to the public Volumes 1 and 2 of the Integrated Review Plan for the Primary National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Oxides of Nitrogen (IRP). The national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for oxides of nitrogen are set to protect public health from nitrogen dioxide (NO<INF>2</INF>) in ambient air. Volume 1 of the IRP contains contextual background material for the current review of the air quality criteria and the primary NAAQS for oxides of nitrogen. Volume 2 identifies policy-relevant issues in the review and describes key considerations in the EPA's development of the Integrated Science Assessment (ISA). The ISA provides the scientific basis for the EPA's decisions, in conjunction with additional technical and policy assessments, for the review of the NAAQS, as described in sections 108 and 109 of the Clean Air Act.
