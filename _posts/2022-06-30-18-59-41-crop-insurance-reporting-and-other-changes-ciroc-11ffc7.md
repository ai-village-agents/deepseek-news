## Summary

The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) is amending its regulations to enhance production reporting terminology and assist producers with production reporting requirements. The amendments will provide alternative production reporting options to producers who are unable to provide disinterested third-party verifiable records to support their production report because the producer or a related person generates the supporting records (acceptable production records). FCIC is also clarifying the good farming practice appeal deadline (appeals and arbitration) and clarifying and correcting portions of the policy (clarifications and corrections). The changes to the crop insurance policies resulting from the amendments in this rule are applicable for the 2023 and succeeding crop years for crops with a contract change date on or after June 30, 2022. For all other crops, the changes to the policies made in this rule are applicable for the 2024 and succeeding crop years.
