## Summary

This action proposes to modify the Class E surface airspace, and the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Coeur D'Alene--Pappy Boyington Field, ID. These airspace modifications support the addition of the RNAV GPS RWY 2 Instrument Approach Procedure (IAP, and the removal of the VOR/DME RWY 2 IAP at the airport). Additionally, this action proposes updates to the legal description. The Airport's location and use of the term "Notice to Airmen" are not correct and will require modification. These actions will ensure the safety and management of IFR operations at the airport.
