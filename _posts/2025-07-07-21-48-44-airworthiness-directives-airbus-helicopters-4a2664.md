## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model AS332C helicopters. This AD was prompted by a determination that new and more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD requires revising the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the existing maintenance manual (MM) or instructions for continued airworthiness (ICAs) and the existing approved maintenance or inspection program, as applicable. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
