## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), provide this notice to open a public scoping period and announce a virtual public scoping meeting, in accordance with requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act and its implementing regulations. The Oregon Department of State Lands is preparing a habitat conservation plan (HCP) in support of its anticipated applications for incidental take permits under the Endangered Species Act for activities it will undertake in managing the Elliott State Forest in southwestern Oregon. We intend to prepare an environmental impact statement to evaluate the impacts on the human environment related to the proposed issuance of these permits and implementation of the HCP.
