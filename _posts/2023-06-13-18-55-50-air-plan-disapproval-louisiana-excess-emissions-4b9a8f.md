## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA, the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to disapprove a revision to the Louisiana State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Louisiana, through the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ), on November 22, 2016, and supplemented on June 9, 2017. The submittals are in response to the EPA's national SIP call of June 12, 2015, concerning excess emissions during periods of Startup, Shutdown and Malfunction (SSM). EPA is proposing to determine that the revision to the SIP in the submittals does not correct the deficiency with the Louisiana SIP identified in the June 12, 2015 SIP call. We are taking this action in accordance with section 110 of the Act.
