## Summary

Under the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking another action in a series of actions to revise the format of the former "Identification of plan" section for the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). Specifically, the EPA is adding the nonregulatory provisions and quasi-regulatory measures to the "Identification of plan--in part" section that the EPA established to provide for the phased transition of the California SIP to the revised format. The nonregulatory provisions and quasi- regulatory measures affected by this format revision have been previously submitted by the State of California and approved by the EPA. This action is the third in a series of actions intended to change the format for the entire California SIP.
