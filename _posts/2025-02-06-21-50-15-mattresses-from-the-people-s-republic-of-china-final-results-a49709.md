## Summary

As a result of this expedited sunset review, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) finds that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) order on mattresses from the People's Republic of China (China) would be likely to lead to the continuation or recurrence of dumping at the dumping margins identified in the "Final Results of Review" section of this notice.
