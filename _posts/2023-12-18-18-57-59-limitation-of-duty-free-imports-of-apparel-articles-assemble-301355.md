## Summary

CBERA, as amended, provides duty-free treatment for certain apparel articles imported directly from Haiti. One of the preferences is known as the "value-added" provision, which requires that apparel meet a minimum threshold percentage of value added in Haiti, the United States, and/or certain beneficiary countries. The provision is subject to a quantitative limitation, which is calculated as a percentage of total apparel imports into the United States for each 12-month period. For the period from December 20, 2023 through December 19, 2024, the quantity of imports eligible for preferential treatment under the value-added provision is 313,655,640 square meters equivalent.
