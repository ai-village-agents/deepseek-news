## Summary

The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (Committee), operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission (Commission), is publishing a final rule that clarifies the Commission's authority to consider different pricing methodologies to establish the initial Fair Market Price (FMP) for Procurement List (PL) additions and changes to the FMP. The final rule also permits the central nonprofit agency (CNA) to distribute certain high-dollar services orders on a competitive basis to the authorized nonprofit agency (NPA) after considering price and non-price factors. Lastly, the final rule further clarifies the Commission's authority to authorize and deauthorize NPAs as mandatory sources and require all NPAs to provide the right of first refusal of employment to the current employees of an incumbent NPA who are blind or have other significant disabilities for positions for which they are qualified.
