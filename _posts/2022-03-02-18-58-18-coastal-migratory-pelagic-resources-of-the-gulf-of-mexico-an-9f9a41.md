## Summary

NMFS closes commercial harvest of king mackerel in the southern zone of the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) exclusive economic zone (EEZ) using run-around gillnet gear. NMFS has determined that the commercial annual catch limit (ACL) for king mackerel harvested by run- around gillnet gear in the Gulf southern zone has been reached. Therefore, NMFS implements an accountability measure (AM) and closes the southern zone to commercial king mackerel fishing using run-around gillnet gear in the Gulf EEZ on March 2, 2022. This closure is necessary to protect the Gulf king mackerel resource.
