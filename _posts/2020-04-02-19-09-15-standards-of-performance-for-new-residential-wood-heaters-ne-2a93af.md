## Summary

In this final action, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is amending the 2015 New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for New Residential Wood Heaters, New Residential Hydronic Heaters and Forced-Air Furnaces. This final action removes certain requirements from the rule for pellet fuel to meet certain specifications regarding density, size, and content, while retaining a provision in the rule that requires EPA-approved third-party organizations to specify minimum requirements as part of the pellet fuel certification process. Also, in this final action, the EPA is deciding not to make changes that it had proposed that would have allowed a sell-through period for Step 1- certified residential wood heating devices that are manufactured before the May 2020 compliance date to be sold at retail after that date. Finally, this preamble provides a clarification of how the "prohibited fuels" provision applies to pallets.
