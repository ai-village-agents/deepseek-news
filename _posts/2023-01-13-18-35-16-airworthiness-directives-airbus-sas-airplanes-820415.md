## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-05-16, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A319-115 airplanes; Model A320-214, -216, -232, -251N, and -271N airplanes; and Model A321-211, -231, -251N, -251NX, -253N, -271N, -271NX, and -272N airplanes. AD 2020-05-16 requires a one-time detailed inspection of certain attaching points on the left-hand and right-hand wings for the correct installation of certain hardware, and, depending on findings, accomplishment of applicable corrective actions. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-05-16, a determination was made that additional airplanes are subject to the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2020-05-16 and would add airplanes to the applicability, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
