## Summary

This notice announces that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is reducing Brunei Darussalam's Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) travel authorization validity period for travel by citizens or nationals of Brunei under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) to the United States from two years from the date of issuance to one year for ESTA applications received after the date of publication of this notice. DHS is making this change based on the Government of Brunei's inability to satisfy multiple VWP requirements.
