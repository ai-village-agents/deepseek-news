## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A300 F4-600R series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of damaged main deck cargo crossbeams on the right-hand side, between certain frame locations. This proposed AD would require repetitive detailed inspections of the affected main deck cargo crossbeams for any damage, and depending on findings, accomplishment of applicable corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which will be incorporated by reference. This proposed AD would also provide optional terminating actions for the repetitive detailed inspections. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
