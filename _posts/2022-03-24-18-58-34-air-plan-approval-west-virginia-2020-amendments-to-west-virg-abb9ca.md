## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule on September 23, 2021, entitled "Air Plan Approval; West Virginia; 2020 Amendments to West Virginia's Ambient Air Quality Standards." This current action corrects an inadvertent error in the DATES section of the final rule by setting an effective date for the state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of West Virginia. West Virginia's revision updated the incorporation by reference of EPA's national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and the associated monitoring reference and equivalent methods. This correction does not change West Virginia's previously approved incorporation by reference, only the DATES section in the preamble removing the request for comments and replacing it with the effective date assigned to it.
