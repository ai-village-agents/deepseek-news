## Summary

NMFS proposes to modify the regulations for Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) section 104 permits, including scientific research, enhancement, photography, and public display permits and Letters of Confirmation (LOCs). The modification would remove the 5- year regulatory limitation on the duration of section 104 permits and LOCs. This would give NMFS the discretion to issue these permits for longer than 5 years where such a duration would be appropriate. This proposed rule would apply only to permits and authorizations issued under section 104 of the MMPA.
