## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Model Trent 1000-AE3, Trent 1000-CE3, Trent 1000-D3, Trent 1000-G3, Trent 1000-H3, Trent 1000-J3, Trent 1000-K3, Trent 1000-L3, Trent 1000-M3, Trent 1000-N3, Trent 1000- P3, Trent 1000-Q3, and Trent 1000-R3 engines. This AD is prompted by a determination that certain intervals for visual inspection of the intermediate-pressure stage 8 (IP8) and high-pressure stage 3 (HP3) air transfer tubes and front bearing housing IP8 air feed tubes need to be reduced. This AD requires initial and repetitive visual inspections of the IP8 and HP3 air transfer tubes and front bearing housing IP8 air feed tubes for cracking, damage, or air leakage wear, and replacement, if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference (IBR). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
