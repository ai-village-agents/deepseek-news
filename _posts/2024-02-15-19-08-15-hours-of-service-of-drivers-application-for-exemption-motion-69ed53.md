## Summary

FMCSA announces its final decision to grant the exemption from the electronic logging device (ELD) requirements requested by the Motion Picture Association (MPA) for all commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers providing transportation to or from a theatrical or television motion picture production site. This renewal of the exemption allows drivers to complete paper records of duty status (RODS) instead of using an ELD. FMCSA announced its decision to provisionally renew MPA's exemption on November 3, 2022, pending a review of any comments received in response to that notice. After reviewing the four comments submitted to the docket, which are discussed in this notice, the Agency believes that drivers who qualify for the exemption will likely maintain a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level of safety that would be achieved by complying with the ELD requirements.
