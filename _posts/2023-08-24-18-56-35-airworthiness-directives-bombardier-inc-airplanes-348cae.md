# Airworthiness Directives; Bombardier, Inc., Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-2B16 (604 Variant) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that some airplanes were delivered without a portable protective breathing equipment (PBE) device located in the forward left side cabin area of the airplane. This proposed AD would require visually inspecting the forward left side cabin area of the airplane to determine if the portable PBE device is installed and, if not installed, would require installing the portable PBE device along with the associated placard. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
