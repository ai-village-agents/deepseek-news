## Summary

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) is seeking public comment on TTB's trade practice regulations related to the Federal Alcohol Administration Act's exclusive outlet, tied house, commercial bribery, and consignment sales prohibitions. President Biden's Executive Order 14036 ("Promoting Competition in the American Economy"), the Department of the Treasury's related February 2022 report ("Competition in the Markets for Beer, Wine, and Spirits"), and public comments related to that report have raised questions about whether these regulations could be improved. To assist the agency in formulating potential proposals to amend the regulations, TTB invites comments on the issues described in this document.
