## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of the Treasury ("Treasury" or "the Department"), Departmental Offices (DO) proposes to establish a new system of records within its inventory of records systems, subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended titled "Departmental Offices .412 Integrated Library System (ILS) Records." This action is necessary to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act to publish in the Federal Register notice of the existence and character of records maintained by DO. The Treasury Library ("Library") in the Office of Privacy, Transparency, & Records uses the records in the ILS to keep track of items borrowed by DO employees from the Library's collection and to ensure that all items are returned to the Library in a timely manner and/or upon a DO employee's resignation from the Department.
