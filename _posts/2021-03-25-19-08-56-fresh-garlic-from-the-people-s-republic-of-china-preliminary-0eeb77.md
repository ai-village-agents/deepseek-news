## Summary

The Department of Commerce (Commerce) is conducting the 25th administrative review of the antidumping duty order on fresh garlic from the People's Republic of China (China). The period of review (POR) for the administrative review is November 1, 2018, through October 31, 2019. Commerce preliminarily determines that the only mandatory respondent for which a request for review remains, Shijiazhuang Goodman Trading Co., Ltd. (Goodman), failed to establish its eligibility for a separate rate and therefore is part of the China-wide entity. We also preliminarily find that the review request made by The Roots Farm Inc. (Roots Farm) was not valid, and accordingly have preliminarily rescinded the review with respect to the other mandatory respondent, Zhengzhou Harmoni Spice Co., Ltd. (Harmoni). We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.
