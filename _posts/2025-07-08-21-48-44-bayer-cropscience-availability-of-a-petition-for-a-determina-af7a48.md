## Summary

We are advising the public that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has received a petition from Bayer CropScience seeking a determination of nonregulated status for MON 95275 maize (corn) which has been developed using genetic engineering to produce two insecticidal proteins and a double-stranded RNA transcript to provide protection from feeding damage caused by targeted coleopteran (corn rootworm) insect pests. We are making the petition and draft plant pest risk assessment available for public review and comment.
