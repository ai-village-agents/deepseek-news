## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes to amend its adjudication regulations concerning survivors benefits claims. With respect to claims processing, VA proposes to clarify that, if VA determines that a surviving spouse or child is eligible for dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC), VA would concurrently deny the co- existing claim for survivors pension, except where paying survivors pension would be more beneficial to the claimant, which would only be the case if the claimant is the veteran's surviving spouse and the claimant's application indicates that the claimant does not have any dependents, is currently in a nursing home, and has applied for or is currently receiving Medicaid. The intended effect of this rulemaking is to streamline and improve the timeliness of the adjudication of claims processing for VA survivors benefits while ensuring that claimants receive the greatest benefit allowed by law.
