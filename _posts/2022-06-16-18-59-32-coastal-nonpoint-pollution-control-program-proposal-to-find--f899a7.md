## Summary

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ("the agencies," hereafter) invite public comment on the agencies' proposed finding that Illinois has satisfied all conditions the agencies established as part of their 2016 approval of the State's coastal nonpoint pollution control program (coastal nonpoint program). The Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendments (CZARA) directs states and territories with coastal zone management programs previously approved under Section 306 of the Coastal Zone Management Act to develop and implement coastal nonpoint programs, which must be submitted to the agencies for approval. Prior to making such a finding, NOAA and the EPA invite public input on the two agencies' rationale for this proposed finding.
