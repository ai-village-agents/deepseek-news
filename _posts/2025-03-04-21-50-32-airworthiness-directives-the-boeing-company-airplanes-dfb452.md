## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER series airplanes. This AD was prompted by two engine fan blade-out (FBO) events that resulted in the separation of engine inlet cowl and fan cowl parts from the airplane. In one event, fan cowl parts damaged the fuselage, which caused loss of pressurization and subsequent emergency descent. This AD requires replacing specified inlet cowl aft bulkhead fasteners for certain airplanes; for certain other airplanes, inspecting the inlet cowl aft bulkhead fastener and replacing the fasteners if rivets are found, and, for all airplanes, replacement of the crushable spacers used in the attachment of the inlet cowl to the engine fan case; or as an option, installing a serviceable inlet cowl. This AD also requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new airworthiness limitations (AWLs). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
