## Summary

The EPA is proposing to determine that the reduction in expenditures of recurrent non-Federal funds for the Hawaii Department of Health (HDOH) in support of its continuing air program under section 105 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) for the fiscal year (FY) 2022 is a result of non-selective reductions in expenditures. This determination, when final, will permit the HDOH to receive grant funding for FY2023 from the EPA under section 105 of the CAA.
