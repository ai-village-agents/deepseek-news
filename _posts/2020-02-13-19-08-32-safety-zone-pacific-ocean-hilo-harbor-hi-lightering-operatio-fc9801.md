## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for the navigable waters of Hilo Harbor, Hawaii. The temporary safety zone encompasses all waters extending 100 yards in all directions from position 19[deg]44'41.17'' N; 155[deg]05'24.23'' W. The safety zone is needed to protect personnel, vessels and the marine environment from potential hazards associated with ongoing lightering operations of the vessel MIDWAY ISLAND grounded along the northwest side of Hilo Harbor, particularly through helicopter to shore hoisting ops and swimmers in the water. The USCG is overseeing contractor lightering ops to mitigate the pollution threat from the vessel in this area. Entry of vessels or persons into this zone is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port (COTP) Honolulu.
