## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace at Plymouth and Winamac, IN. The FAA is proposing this action due to an airspace review conducted as part of the decommissioning of the Knox very high frequency (VHF) omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimal Operational Network (MON) Program. The geographic coordinates of Plymouth Municipal Airport would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
