## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited Model DHC-8-400 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that a number of nacelle A-frames were not manufactured in accordance with engineering drawings. This proposed AD would require, depending on airplane configuration, removing the fasteners on the nacelle A-frame side brace sub-assemblies, doing an eddy current inspection for cracking, cold-working the holes, installing oversize fasteners, re- identifying the reworked side brace fitting and A-frame, and repair if necessary. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
