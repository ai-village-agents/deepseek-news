## Summary

This rule prescribes special migratory bird hunting regulations for certain Tribes on Federal Indian reservations, off- reservation trust lands, and ceded lands. This rule responds to Tribal requests for U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (hereinafter "Service" or "we") recognition of their authority to regulate hunting under established guidelines. This rule allows the establishment of season bag limits and, thus, harvest at levels compatible with populations and habitat conditions.
