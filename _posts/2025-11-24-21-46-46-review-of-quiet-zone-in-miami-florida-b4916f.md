## Summary

FRA is providing notice of its intent to review a quiet zone (THR-000000111223) located in Miami, Florida. Based on a high rate of reported accidents/incidents between January 2020 and January 2025, FRA has made a preliminary determination that safety systems and measures implemented within the quiet zone do not fully compensate for the absence of routine sounding of the locomotive horn due to a substantial increase in risk with respect to loss of life or serious personal injury within the quiet zone. Further, FRA discovered that the documentation submitted and relied upon by the City of Miami (the Public Authority) to establish the quiet zone may contain substantial errors that have an adverse impact on public safety. Therefore, FRA intends to review existing conditions within the quiet zone to determine whether it should be terminated or whether additional safety measures may be necessary to ensure safety.
