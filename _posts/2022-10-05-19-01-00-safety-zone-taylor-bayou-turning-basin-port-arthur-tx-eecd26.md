## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to extend the effective period of the temporary safety zone on the upper reaches of Taylor Bayou Turning Basin in Port Arthur, TX. This action is necessary to provide protection to the levee protection wall located at the north end of the turning basin until permanent repairs can be effected. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from entering the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Marine Safety Unit Port Arthur or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
