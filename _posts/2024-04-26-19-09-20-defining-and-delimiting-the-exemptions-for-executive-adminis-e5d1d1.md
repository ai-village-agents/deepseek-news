## Summary

The Department of Labor (Department) is updating and revising the regulations issued under the Fair Labor Standards Act implementing the exemptions from minimum wage and overtime pay requirements for executive, administrative, professional, outside sales, and computer employees. Significant revisions include increasing the standard salary level, increasing the highly compensated employee total annual compensation threshold, and adding to the regulations a mechanism that will allow for the timely and efficient updating of the salary and compensation thresholds, including an initial update on July 1, 2024, to reflect earnings growth. The Department is not finalizing in this rule its proposal to apply the standard salary level to the U.S. territories subject to the Federal minimum wage and to update the special salary levels for American Samoa and the motion picture industry.
