## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is withdrawing the advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) published in the Federal Register on October 17, 2022, that requested public comment on expanding VA's incentivized loss-mitigation options available to servicers that assist veterans whose VA-guaranteed loans are in default. VA is withdrawing this ANPRM because of ongoing assessments of agency needs, priorities, and objectives. VA will continue to explore opportunities to assist veterans who face home loan default.
