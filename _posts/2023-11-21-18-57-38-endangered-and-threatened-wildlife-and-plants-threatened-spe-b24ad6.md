## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are reopening the comment period on our October 18, 2022, proposed rule to list the Kern Canyon slender salamander (Batrachoseps simatus) and the relictual slender salamander (Batrachoseps relictus) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), and to designate critical habitat. This action will allow all interested parties an additional opportunity to comment on the October 18, 2022, proposed rule, as well as the opportunity to comment on the new areas we are considering for relictual slender salamander critical habitat, small changes to Kern Canyon slender salamander critical habitat, and our updates to the physical or biological features for the Kern Canyon slender salamander, in response to previously submitted public comments. Comments previously submitted need not be resubmitted as they are already incorporated into the public record and will be fully considered in the final rule.
