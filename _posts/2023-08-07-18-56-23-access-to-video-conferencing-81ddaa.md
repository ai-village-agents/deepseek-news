## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) proposes to amend its rules to ensure that interoperable video conferencing services (IVCS) are accessible to people with disabilities and to facilitate the integration and appropriate use of telecommunications relay services (TRS) with video conferencing. These amendments are proposed to meet the need for people with disabilities to participate fully in video conferences, a technology that appears to have permanently altered the norms of modern communication in the workplace, healthcare, education, social interaction, and civic life.
