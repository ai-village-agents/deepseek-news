## Summary

As a result of the determinations by the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on certain cold-rolled steel flat products (cold-rolled steel) from the People's Republic of China (China), India, Japan, the Republic of Korea (Korea), and the United Kingdom (UK) would likely lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping, net countervailable subsidies, and material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation of the AD and CVD orders. In addition, as a result of the ITC's determination that revocation of the AD and CVD orders on certain cold-rolled steel from Brazil is not likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is revoking the AD and CVD orders on cold-rolled steel from Brazil.
