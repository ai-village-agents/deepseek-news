## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-11-17 and AD 2021-11-22, which apply to all Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (AHD) Model EC135P1, EC135P2, EC135P2+, EC135P3, EC135T1, EC135T2, EC135T2+, and EC135T3 helicopters. AD 2021-11-17 requires a one-time visual inspection of certain part-numbered main rotor actuators (MRAs). AD 2021-11-22 requires revising the life limits of certain parts and removing each part that has reached its life limit. Since the FAA issued those ADs, it was determined that repetitive inspections of the MRAs are necessary, new and more restrictive tasks and limitations have been issued, and that it is necessary to expand the applicability. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions required by AD 2021-11-17 and AD 2021-11-22, except this proposed AD would require changing the one-time MRA inspection to a repetitive inspection and incorporating other new and more restrictive tasks and limitations by revising the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the existing helicopter maintenance manual or instructions for continued airworthiness and the existing approved maintenance or inspection program, as applicable. This proposed AD would also expand the applicability by adding Model EC635T2+ helicopters. These actions are specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
