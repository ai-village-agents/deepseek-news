## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) proposes to permit geostationary satellite orbit (GSO) space station in the fixed-satellite service (FSS) to operate downlinks (space-to-Earth) in the 17.3-17.8 GHz frequency band, subject to certain limitations, and also proposes related technical updates to its rules governing the FSS and the Broadcasting-Satellite Service to prevent harmful interference.
