## Summary

The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) amends the Common Crop Insurance Regulations, Forage Seeding Crop Insurance Provisions. The intended effect of this action is to clarify that producers are able to purchase or change insurance coverage on spring seeded forage until the spring sales closing date if they did not plant any insurable fall seeded forage in the same crop year. The changes are to be effective for the 2022 and succeeding crop years.
