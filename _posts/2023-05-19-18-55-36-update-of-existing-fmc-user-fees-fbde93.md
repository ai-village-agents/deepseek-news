## Summary

On March 21, 2023, the Federal Maritime Commission (Commission) published a direct final rule, which notified the public of our intent to update its current user fees and amend the relevant regulations to reflect these updates, pursuant to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-25. The direct final rule stated that it would increase some fees to reflect increases in salaries of employees assigned to certain fee-generating services. For one service, the rule would lower fees because less-senior employees are assigned to the fee- generating activity. The rule will go into effect as scheduled.
