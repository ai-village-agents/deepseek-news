## Summary

This action amends the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Wellsville Municipal Airport/Tarantine Field, Wellsville, NY. This action is the result of an airspace review caused by the decommissioning of the Wellsville VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) navigation aids as part of the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program. The name and geographical coordinates of the airport are also being updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
