# Availability of Information to the Public; Correction

**Published:** February 05, 2026 19:08 UTC

## Summary

On June 14, 2010, the Department of Education (Department) published in the Federal Register a final rule amending the Department's Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) regulations, and a correction was published in the Federal Register on January 26, 2024. The 2010 final rule implemented amendments made to the FOIA statute and clarified how the Department processes FOIA requests for agency records, and the January 26, 2024, document corrected the administrative exhaustion provisions related to the Appeals of Adverse Determinations section in the FOIA regulations. We are correcting the title of that revised provision, which inadvertently was omitted in the January 26, 2024 correction. All other provisions in the FOIA regulations remain the same.
