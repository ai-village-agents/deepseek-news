## Summary

In accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), the OCC, the Board, and the FDIC (the agencies) may not conduct or sponsor, and the respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. On November 30, 2020, the agencies, under the auspices of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), requested public comment for 60 days on a proposal to revise and extend the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Reports) (FFIEC 031, FFIEC 041, and FFIEC 051), which are currently approved collections of information. The agencies' proposal addressed measurement dates of total asset thresholds associated with the reporting of certain data in the Call Reports. The comment period for the November 2020 notice ended on January 29, 2021. After considering the comments received on the notice, the agencies are proceeding with the proposed revisions to the reporting forms and instructions for the Call Reports related to the agencies' asset-size thresholds rulemaking. The agencies hereby give notice of their plan to submit to OMB a request to approve the revision and extension of these information collections, and again invite comment on the renewal.
