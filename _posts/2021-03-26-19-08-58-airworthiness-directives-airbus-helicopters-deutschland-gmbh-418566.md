## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 97-26-02 for Eurocopter Deutschland GmbH Model BO-105A, BO-105C, BO-105S, BO- 105LS A-1, and BO-105LS A-3 helicopters; and Eurocopter Canada Ltd. Model BO-105LS A-3 helicopters. AD 97-26-02 required a repetitive visual inspection for cracks in the ribbed area of the main rotor (M/R) mast flange (flange), and depending on the outcome, replacing the M/R mast. This new AD retains the requirements of AD 97-26-02 and removes the reinforced M/R mast from the applicability. This AD was prompted by the determination that a certain reinforced M/R mast is not affected by the unsafe condition. The actions of this AD are intended to address an unsafe condition on these products.
