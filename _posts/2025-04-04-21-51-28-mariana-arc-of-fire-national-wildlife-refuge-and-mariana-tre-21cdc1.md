## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, announce corrections to the spelling of the Mariana Trench Marine National Monument and to the coordinates of geographic features (hydrothermal vent fields) within the Mariana Arc of Fire National Refuge. This notice corrects the spelling "Marianas Trench Marine National Monument" to "Mariana Trench Marine National Monument" for consistency in official documents and other publications. It also makes corrections to coordinates of hydrothermal vent fields. This will ensure proper mapping and data management and facilitate enforcement of protections within the Refuge boundaries. These corrections are nonsubstantive.
