## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for a new information collection. The FAA proposes collecting information about requests for waivers from certain operational rules that apply to small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS). The FAA will use the collected information to make determinations whether to authorize or deny the requested operations of sUAS. The proposed information collection is necessary to issue such authorizations or denials consistent with the FAA's mandate to ensure safe and efficient use of national airspace.
