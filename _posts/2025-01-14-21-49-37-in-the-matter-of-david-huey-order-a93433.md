## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing an Order prohibiting Mr. Huey, a former manager at Titan Inspections, Inc. (Titan), from participating in NRC-licensed activities for three years. This action is being taken because the NRC determined that Mr. Huey deliberately caused Titan to violate NRC requirements by directing a radiographer to perform radiography at a location within NRC jurisdiction without a second qualified individual being present. Such conduct violates NRC regulations, which prohibit any licensee or employee of a licensee from engaging in deliberate misconduct that causes or would have caused, if not detected, a licensee, to be in violation of any rule, regulation, order, or any term, condition, or limitation of any license issued by the Commission. The Order is effective upon issuance.
