## Summary

This amends the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Wharton Regional Airport, Wharton, TX. This action is the result of airspace reviews caused by the decommissioning of the Wharton non-directional beacon (NDB). The name and geographic coordinates of the airport are also being updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
