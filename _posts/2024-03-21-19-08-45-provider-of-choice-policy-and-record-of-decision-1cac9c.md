## Summary

Bonneville released its Provider of Choice Policy (Policy), which addresses the Agency's regional firm power sales policy for fiscal year 2029 through fiscal year 2044. The Policy will shape Bonneville's long-term power sales contracts following the expiration of current long-term Regional Dialogue contracts on September 30, 2028. The Policy describes the Agency's products and service offerings for the next contract period and how the Agency proposes to distribute the costs and benefits from its system of Federal resources, which includes the Federal Columbia River Power System, the Columbia Generating Station, as well as non-Federal resources. Alongside the Policy, Bonneville released a record of decision.
