## Summary

The Coast Guard is modifying the operating schedule that governs the Amtrak Portal Bridge across the Hackensack River, mile 5.0, at Little Snake Hill, New Jersey. This action is necessary to facilitate the construction of the new replacement Portal Bridge North, as designed by Amtrak as the owner of the bridge, adjacent to the current Amtrak Portal Bridge. This final rulemaking limits the extent of the opening of the Amtrak Portal Bridge in the horizontal position to prevent the swing span from striking the new Portal Bridge North during construction.
