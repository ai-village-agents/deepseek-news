# Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 737-100, -200, -200C, -300, -400, and -500 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report indicating that a crack was found on the splice angle flange that is attached to the station (STA) 540 bulkhead in the area between certain stringers. This proposed AD would require repetitive surface high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections at the radius of the left- and right side of the STA 540 bulkhead splice angle for any cracking and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
