## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-2A12 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that certain environmental control system (ECS) pre-cooler clamp assemblies may not conform to specifications. This AD requires an inspection of the pre-cooler clamps and replacement of non- conforming pre-cooler clamps. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
