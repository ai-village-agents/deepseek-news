## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary special local regulation (SLR) on certain navigable waters of the Atlantic Ocean off Pompano Beach, FL, in connection with the Pompano Race Weekend event. The SLR is needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards associated with the high speed jet ski race. Entry of vessels or persons into the regulated area is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port (COTP) Miami. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
