## Summary

In compliance with Section 7 of Executive Order 13921, "Promoting American Seafood Competitiveness and Economic Growth" NMFS intends to prepare a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) to evaluate alternatives for identifying Aquaculture Opportunity Areas (AOAs) in Federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The PEIS will be prepared in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the regulations published by the Council on Environmental Quality, and NOAA's NEPA implementing procedures, NOAA Administrative Order 216-6A and its Companion Manual. Input from stakeholders and the public is essential to identifying AOAs; and this notice initiates the public scoping process for the PEIS, which includes a 60-day public comment period. The intent of this PEIS is to support long-term planning for offshore aquaculture by analyzing potential locations for one or more offshore AOAs in the Gulf of Mexico and the types of impacts that could be associated with future proposed aquaculture projects in those locations. Comments that are provided prior to the close of the comment period and clearly articulate opinions or concerns will provide the greatest assistance to NMFS in the preparation of the PEIS.
