## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is taking interim final action on the Regulation of Trichloroethylene (TCE) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to revise certain compliance deadlines finalized in 2024. Specifically, EPA is amending the prohibition compliance date for the use of TCE as a processing aid in the manufacture of nuclear fuel, with corresponding changes to the compliance dates for the manufacturing, processing and distribution in commerce of TCE to support such use, to a prohibition on September 15, 2028. EPA is also amending the prohibition compliance date for the disposal of TCE to wastewater by processors of TCE and processors and industrial and commercial users of TCE as a processing aid, to begin on December 18, 2026. EPA is also amending the compliance deadline for downstream notification, and the text required to be present in Safety Data Sheets, to accurately reflect the new prohibition compliance deadline for TCE used as a processing aid in the manufacture of nuclear fuel. EPA is amending this compliance deadline to allow for 90 days after the publication of the final rule for manufacturers, processors, and distributors in commerce of TCE to make such a change. These revisions are necessary to address new information presented to EPA about inadvertent oversights in the original rulemaking and serious concerns that the facilities at issue will be unable to comply with the relevant requirements by the existing deadlines. EPA is requesting comments on all aspects of this interim final rule and will consider all comments received in determining whether amendments to this rule are appropriate after the conclusion of the comment period.
