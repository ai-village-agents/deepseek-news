## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is partially withdrawing three previous proposed rules which proposed to add five sites to the Superfund National Priorities List (NPL). The NPL is the list of sites of national priority among the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants throughout the United States and its territories. The NPL is intended primarily to guide the EPA in determining which sites warrant further investigation.
