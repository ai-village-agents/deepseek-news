## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") proposes to amend the test procedures for faucets and showerheads to incorporate the current version of the referenced industry standard, American Society of Mechanical Engineers Standard A112.18.1-2018, "Plumbing Fixture Fittings." DOE also proposes to add definitions for low-pressure water dispensers and pot fillers, and exclude them from the faucet definition. Finally, DOE proposes to provide further detail for conducting the flow rate measurement. DOE is seeking comment from interested parties on the proposal.
