## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited Model DHC-8-401 and - 402 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports that following a main landing gear (MLG) extension, one of the MLGs could not be locked in the gear down position due to deterioration of greasing effectiveness over time. This AD requires repetitive lubrication of the MLG assembly. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
