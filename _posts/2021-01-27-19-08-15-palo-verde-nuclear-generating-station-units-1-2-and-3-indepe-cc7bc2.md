## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) received and is considering approval of an indirect license transfer application filed by Arizona Public Service Company (APS) on December 2, 2020. The application seeks NRC approval of the indirect transfer of possession- only non-operating interests in Renewed Facility Operating License Nos. NPF-41, NPF-51, and NPF-74 for Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station (Palo Verde), Units 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and the general license for the Palo Verde Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI) from Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM) to Avangrid, Inc. (Avangrid), whereby PNM and its parent holding company would become indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Avangrid. PNM currently owns a 10.2 percent tenant-in-common interest and holds possession-only rights in the NRC licenses. The proposed indirect license transfer would result from Avangrid acquiring PNM and its parent holding company as its subsidiaries, thereby owning 100 percent of the shares in PNM.
