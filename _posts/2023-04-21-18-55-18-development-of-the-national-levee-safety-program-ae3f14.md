## Summary

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) launched the new National Levee Safety Program, authorized by the National Levee Safety Act of 2007, in the fall of 2021. This program is different from the USACE Levee Safety Program. The purpose of the National Levee Safety Program is to improve the way levees are managed throughout the United States and its territories to reduce the impact of flooding and improve the resilience of communities behind levees. There are four major components that are intended to work together to accomplish the goals of the program: National Levee Safety Guidelines; Integrated Levee Management; National Levee Database and Data Collection; and Implementation Support. This notice announces the start of Phase 2 which is the solicitation of input on draft products and resources developed based on input received during Phase 1 stakeholder engagement activities.
