## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing a rule under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to address its obligations under TSCA for phenol, isopropylated phosphate (3:1) (PIP (3:1)) (CASRN 68937-41-7), which EPA has determined meets the requirements for expedited action under TSCA. This final rule prohibits the processing and distribution of PIP (3:1) and PIP (3:1)-containing products, with specified exclusions, and prohibits the release of PIP (3:1) to water during manufacturing, processing, and distribution. This final rule also requires commercial users to follow existing regulations and best practices to prevent the release to water of PIP (3:1) and products containing PIP (3:1) during use. These requirements will result in lower amounts of PIP (3:1) being manufactured, processed, distributed in commerce, used and disposed, thereby reducing exposures to humans and the environment.
