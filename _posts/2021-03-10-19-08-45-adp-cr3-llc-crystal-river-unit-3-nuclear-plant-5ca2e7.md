## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing an exemption in response to a January 19, 2021, request from ADP CR3, LLC (ADP CR3) for the Crystal River Unit 3 Nuclear Plant, from the requirement to investigate and report to the NRC when ADP CR3 does not receive notification of receipt of a shipment, or part of a shipment, of low-level radioactive waste within 20 days after transfer from the Crystal River facility. ADP CR3 requested that the time period for it to receive acknowledgement that the shipment has been received by the intended recipient be extended from 20 to 45 days to avoid an excessive administrative burden as operational experience indicates that rail or mixed mode shipments may take more than 20 days to reach their destination.
