## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce the availability of a draft comprehensive conservation plan (CCP) and associated environmental assessment (EA) for the Charles M. Russell Wetland Management District (District) for review and comment. The District is distinct from the Charles M. Russell (CMR) National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) and this draft CCP and EA will not impact management of that refuge. The draft CCP describes the vision, goals, objectives, and strategies that will guide the long-term management of the District. The draft EA describes the impacts of implementing the objectives and strategies of the CCP on the environment, as well as alternative management objectives and strategies the Service is considering, in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act. We invite comment from the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies.
