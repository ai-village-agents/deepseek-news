## Summary

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has made a decision to adopt the Preferred Alternative identified in the Cumberland Fossil Plant Retirement Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). The Notice of Availability of the Final EIS for the Cumberland Fossil Plant Retirement was published in the Federal Register on December 9, 2022. TVA's preferred alternative, Alternative A, involves the retirement and demolition of TVA's two-unit, coal-fired Cumberland Fossil Plant (CUF) and the construction and operation of a natural gas-fueled combined cycle (CC) plant on the CUF Reservation to replace the generation capacity of one of the two retired units. This least-cost alternative would achieve the purpose and need of the project to retire and decommission the two CUF units, one unit by the end of 2026 and the other unit by the end of 2028, and to provide replacement generation that can supply 1,450 megawatts (MW) of firm, dispatchable power by the time the first unit is retired by the end of 2026 to ensure that TVA is able to meet required year-round generation, maximum capacity system demands and planning reserve margin targets, particularly during peak load events.
