## Summary

We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), are approving, in part, and denying, in part, an amendment to the Montana regulatory program under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). Montana submitted this proposed amendment to OSMRE on its own initiative in response to a State law passed by the Montana Legislature (House Bill (HB) 576). The proposed amendment generally concerns proposed changes to the definition of material damage and changes to permit requirements related to hydrologic information.
