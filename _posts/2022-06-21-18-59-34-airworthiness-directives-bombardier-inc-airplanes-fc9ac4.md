# Airworthiness Directives; Bombardier, Inc., Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-2A12 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a lateral offset observed on the head-up display (HUD) of several airplanes between the synthetic vision system (SVS) and actual runway due to mechanical misalignment of the HUD during manufacturing and assembly. This proposed AD would require revising the existing Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to prohibit steep approach landing (SAL) and enhanced flight vision system (EFVS) operations. This proposed AD would also require calibrating the HUD. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
