## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping duty (AD) order on certain cold-drawn mechanical tubing of carbon and alloy steel (cold-drawn mechanical tubing) from Italy with respect to one exporter/producer of subject merchandise. The period of review (POR) is June 1, 2021, through May 31, 2022. Commerce preliminarily finds that sales of cold- drawn mechanical tubing from Italy were made at less than normal value (NV) during the POR. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.
