## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited Model DHC-8-400 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of a quality escape in the manufacturing of advanced pneumatic detector (APD) switches, which consisted of the presence of contamination on the switch contact pin. This AD requires identification and testing, and reidentification or replacement if necessary, of affected APDs. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
