## Summary

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) invites public comment on one currently approved Information Collection Request (ICR), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number 1652-0040, abstracted below that we will submit to OMB for an extension in compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected burden. This ICR involves three broad categories of affected populations operating under a security program: aircraft operators, foreign air carriers, and indirect air carriers. The collections of information that make up this ICR include security programs, security threat assessments (STA) on certain individuals, known shipper data via the Known Shipper Management System (KSMS), Indirect Air Carrier Management System (IACMS), and evidence of compliance recordkeeping.
