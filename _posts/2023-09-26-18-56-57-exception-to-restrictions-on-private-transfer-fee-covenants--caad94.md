## Summary

The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is proposing to amend its regulation that restricts its regulated entities--the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) (collectively, the Enterprises), and the Federal Home Loan Banks (Banks)--from purchasing, investing in, accepting as collateral, or otherwise dealing in mortgages on properties encumbered by certain types of private transfer fee covenants (PTFCs), and in related securities, subject to certain exceptions (PTFC Regulation). The proposed rule would establish an additional exception to the restrictions for loans on properties with PTFCs, and related securities, if the loans meet certain shared equity loan program requirements for Resale Restriction Programs in FHFA's Duty to Serve Underserved Markets Regulation (Duty to Serve Regulation).
