## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing Revision 3 to Regulatory Guide (RG) 3.54, "Spent Fuel Heat Generation in an Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation." This RG includes methods acceptable to the NRC staff for calculating spent nuclear fuel heat generation rates for use for an Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation. Revision 3 incorporates corrections to Appendix A, Table A-1 that were erroneously recorded in the previous revision (Revision 2 to this RG). In general, this revision presents an up-to-date methodology for determining heat generation rates and it also allows loading of higher burnup fuel by using more accurate methods for decay heat calculations.
