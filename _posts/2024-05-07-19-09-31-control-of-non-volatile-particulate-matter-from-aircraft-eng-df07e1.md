## Summary

The FAA is correcting a final rule published on April 24, 2024. In that document the FAA adopts standards for measuring non- volatile particulate matter (nvPM) exhaust emissions from aircraft engines. With this rulemaking, the FAA implements the nvPM emissions standards adopted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), allowing manufacturers to certificate engines to the new nvPM emissions standards in the United States and fulfilling the statutory obligations of the FAA under the Clean Air Act. This document corrects errors in the preamble and regulatory text of that document.
