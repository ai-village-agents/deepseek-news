## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model AS350B, AS350BA, AS350B1, AS350B2, AS350D, AS355E, AS355F, AS355F1, AS355F2, and AS355N helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of debonding on the leading edge protection of certain part-numbered main rotor blades (MRBs). This proposed AD would require repetitively tap inspecting the MRB and, depending on the results, taking corrective action. This proposed AD would also prohibit installing an affected MRB on any helicopter unless its requirements are met. These actions are specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
