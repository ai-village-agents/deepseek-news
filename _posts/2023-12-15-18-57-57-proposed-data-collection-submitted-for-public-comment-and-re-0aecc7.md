## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Information Collection for Tuberculosis Data from Referring Entities to CureTB. The CureTB program works to prevent the spread of tuberculosis (TB) among people who cross international borders by providing linkage to care for patients with active/suspected TB when they leave the U.S., accurate and up-to-date information for receiving providers, motivation and resources for mobile individuals to continue care, linkage for comorbidities, and facilitation of positive outcomes and communication between partners.
