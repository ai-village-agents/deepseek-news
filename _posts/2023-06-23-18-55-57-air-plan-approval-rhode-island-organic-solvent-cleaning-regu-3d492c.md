## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Rhode Island. This SIP amendment consists of revisions to the Rhode Island Air Pollution Control Regulation No. 36, currently codified in Title 250 Department of Environmental Management, Chapter 120 Air Resources, Subchapter 05 Air Pollution Control, Part 36 Control of Emissions from Organic Solvent Cleaning (Part 36). The proposed SIP revisions include minor regulatory changes that were necessary to provide consistency with the federal regulations for National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Halogenated Solvent Cleaning. This action is being taken under the Clean Air Act.
