# Pacific Island Fisheries; Annual Catch Limits and Accountability Measures for Main Hawaiian Islands Kona Crab for Fishing Years 2024-2026

## Summary

This final rule implements an annual catch limit (ACL), annual catch target (ACT), and accountability measures (AM) for main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) Kona crab for fishing years 2024, 2025, and 2026. NMFS will close Federal waters to Kona crab fishing for the remainder of the fishing year if NMFS projects the fishery will reach the ACT. NMFS will reduce the ACT and ACL in the subsequent fishing year by the overage amount if landings exceed the ACL in a fishing year. NMFS intends this final rule to support the long-term sustainability of MHI Kona crab.
