## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) (together, the Services), have received two separate incidental take permit (ITP) applications from the Oregon Department of State Lands (ODSL; applicant), associated with ODSL's Elliott State Research Forest habitat conservation plan (HCP). The applications, including the HCP, have been submitted pursuant to the Endangered Species Act. ODSL is seeking authorization from the Services for the incidental take of three species (two under FWS jurisdiction, and one under NMFS jurisdiction), expected to result from research and management activities on the Elliott State Forest in Coos and Douglas Counties, Oregon. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), this notice also announces the availability of a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS). FWS is the lead Federal agency under NEPA, and NMFS is a cooperating agency. We invite public comments on the HCP and DEIS from the public and Federal, Tribal, State, and local governments.
