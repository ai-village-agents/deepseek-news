## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-04- 12, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. AD 2023-04-12 required repetitive detailed inspections of affected cargo sealing tapes and applicable corrective actions. Since the FAA issued AD 2023-04-12, additional locations have been identified that are subject to the unsafe condition. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2023-04-12 and expands the inspection area, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
