## Summary

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) requests public comment on Werner Enterprises' (Werner) application for an exemption from the requirement that certain data fields be included in electronic records of duty status (RODS) files presented by electronic logging devices (ELDs). Specifically, Werner requests that, during the first eight days that each of its drivers transitions to an ELD from its new supplier, Platform Science, five specific data fields in the RODS files accessible through the in-cab ELD unit be left blank due to file compatibility issues between the suppliers' systems.
