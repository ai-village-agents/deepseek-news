## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action on Colorado and North Dakota's Clean Air Act (CAA) state implementation plan (SIP) submissions with respect to infrastructure requirements for the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Specifically, the EPA is approving Colorado's September 17, 2018, infrastructure SIP in full, and approving North Dakota's November 6, 2018 infrastructure SIP in part (and disapproving in part). We are also approving a portion of North Dakota's May 2, 2019, submission of Chapter 33.1-15-15, the air pollution control rules of the State of North Dakota, that updates the date of incorporation by reference (IBR) of Federal rules.
