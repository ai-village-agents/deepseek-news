## Summary

The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law or BIL, created the Rural and Tribal Assistance Pilot Program (the Program) to provide early-stage development assistance for rural and tribal infrastructure projects. The Program will award grants for either the hiring of staff or the procurement of expert firms to provide financial, technical, and legal assistance; assistance with development-phase activities; and information regarding innovative financing best practices and case studies. Entities eligible for award include rural local governments or political subdivisions, states, Tribes, and the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. The Build America Bureau (Bureau) will administer the Program. This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) makes $3.4 million available for awards under the Program. Assistance will be provided in the form of direct monetary grants for recipients to hire staff or procure advisory assistance. Procurements for and contracts with grantee-contracted advisors procured for this award must comply with the requirements set forth in the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, as further described below.
