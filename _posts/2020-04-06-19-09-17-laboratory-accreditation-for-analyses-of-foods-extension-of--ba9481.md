## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is extending for a second time the comment period for the proposed rule, and for the information collection related to the proposed rule, entitled "Laboratory Accreditation for Analyses of Foods" that appeared in the Federal Register of November 4, 2019. We are taking this action in response to a request from several food industry associations to extend open comment periods while their members focus on continuity of critical infrastructure operations due to the recent COVID-19 public health declaration. We also are taking this action to keep the comment period for the information collection provisions associated with the rule consistent with the comment period for the proposed rule.
