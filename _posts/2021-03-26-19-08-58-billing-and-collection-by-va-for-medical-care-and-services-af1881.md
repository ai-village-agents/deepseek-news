## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) adopts as final, with nonsubstantive changes, a proposed rule to revise its regulations concerning collection and recovery by VA for medical care and services provided to an individual for treatment of a nonservice-connected disability. Specifically, this rulemaking will revise the provisions of VA regulations that determine the charges VA will bill third-party payers for non-VA care provided at VA expense, will include a time limit for which third-party payers can request a refund, and will clarify that third-party payers cannot reduce or refuse payment because of the billing methodology used to determine the charge.
