## Summary

Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on May 5, 2022, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. of Santa Clara, California and ATI Technologies ULC of Canada. A supplement to the complaint was filed on May 18, 2022. The complaint alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain graphics systems, components thereof, and digital televisions containing the same by reason of the infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 7,742,053 ("the '053 patent"), U.S. Patent No. 8,760,454 ("the '454 patent"), U.S. Patent No. 11,184,628 ("the '628 patent"), U.S. Patent No. 8,468,547 ("the '547 patent"), and U.S. Patent No. 8,854,381 ("the '381 patent"). The complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists and is in the process of being established as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The complainants request that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a limited exclusion order and cease and desist orders.
