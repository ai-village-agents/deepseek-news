## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Region 9 is proposing to reissue a general National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for water discharges from facilities classified as low threat located in the Navajo Nation (Permit No. NNG990001). The permit will be reissued upon completion of the notice and comment period and after due consideration has been given to all comments received. The permit, upon issuance, will be valid for five years. Use of a general NPDES permit in the location described above allows EPA and dischargers to allocate resources in a more efficient manner, obtain timely permit coverage, and avoid issuing resource intensive individual permits to each facility, while simultaneously providing greater certainty and efficiency to the regulated community and ensuring consistent permit conditions for comparable facilities. This notice announces the availability of the proposed general NPDES permit and the corresponding fact sheet for public comment which can be found at EPA Region 9's website at: https://www.epa.gov/npdes-permits/npdes- permits-epas-pacific-southwest-region-9.
