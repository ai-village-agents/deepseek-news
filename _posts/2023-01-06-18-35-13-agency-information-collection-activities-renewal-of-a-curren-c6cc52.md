## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FMCSA announces its plan to submit the Information Collection Request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review and approval and invites public comment. FMCSA requests approval to renew an existing ICR titled, "Hazardous Materials Safety Permits." This ICR requires companies holding safety permits to develop communications plans that allow for the periodic tracking of the shipments. A record of the communications that includes the time of the call and location of the shipment may be kept by either the driver (e.g., recorded in the log book) or the company. These records must be kept, either physically or electronically, for at least 6 months at the company's principal place of business or readily available to the employees at the company's principal place of business. This ICR is being renewed only to the extent that the number of motor carriers with an active Hazardous Materials (HM) Safety Permit has increased from 987 to 1065.
