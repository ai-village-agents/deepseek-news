## Summary

The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) revises the regulation providing guidance for domestic manufacturers that consume Upland Cotton and voluntarily participate in the Economic Adjustment Assistance for Textile Mills Program. The revisions add definitions and codify certain participant responsibilities currently outlined in the existing user Agreement. The changes made by this rule are intended to strengthen management controls that have been added into the Agreement to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse. This action provides the necessary legal support for program administration.
