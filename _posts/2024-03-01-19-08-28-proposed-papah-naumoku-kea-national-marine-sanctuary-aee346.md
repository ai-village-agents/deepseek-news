## Summary

NOAA proposes to designate marine portions of Papah[amacr]naumoku[amacr]kea Marine National Monument as Papah[amacr]naumoku[amacr]kea National Marine Sanctuary (proposed sanctuary) to protect nationally significant biological, cultural, and historical resources and to manage this special place as part of the National Marine Sanctuary System. The proposed sanctuary consists of an area of approximately 582,570 square statute miles (439,910 square nautical miles) of Pacific Ocean waters surrounding the Northwest Hawaiian Islands and the submerged lands thereunder. NOAA proposes to establish the terms of designation for the proposed sanctuary and proposes regulations to implement the designation of the national marine sanctuary. NOAA is also publishing a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS), prepared in coordination with the State of Hawai[revaps]i, and a draft management plan (DMP). NOAA is soliciting public comments on the proposed rule, the DEIS and the DMP.
