## Summary

NASA is proposing to amend the NASA Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (NFS) to reflect updates to NASA's Mentor Prot[eacute]g[eacute] Program (MPP) including: the requirement of Small Business Specialists' concurrence on the signed letter of endorsement; requirements associated with credit received towards subcontracting goals; the change of the MPP reporting requirement from semi-annually to annually; identified the NASA Mentor Prot[eacute]g[eacute] Program Office; and clerical, semantic improvements. NASA also proposes to amend the NFS language to reflect the annual negotiation of its small business percentage goals. Lastly, the NFS will be amended to emphasize collaboration amongst representatives from the Office of Small Business Programs, Office of Procurement, and Program Offices to reduce barriers to entry and to opportunities for all small business concerns and Historically Black Colleges and Universities or Minority Institutions.
