# Radio Broadcasting Services; Various Locations

## Summary

This document amends the Table of FM Allotments, of the Federal Communications Commission's (Commission) rules, by removing certain vacant FM allotment channels that were auctioned through our FM competitive bidding process and are no longer considered vacant FM allotments. The FM allotments are currently authorized licensed stations. FM assignments for authorized stations and reserved facilities will be reflected solely in Media Bureau's Licensing Management System (LMS). These FM allotment channels have previously undergone notice and comment rule making. This action constitutes an editorial change in the FM Table of Allotments. Therefore, we find for good cause that further notice and comment are unnecessary.
