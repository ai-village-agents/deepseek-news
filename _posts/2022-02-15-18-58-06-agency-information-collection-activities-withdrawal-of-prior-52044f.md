## Summary

The Department of Commerce (Department) published a notice in the Federal Register of its intent to request that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) extend approval, without change, under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), to a collection of information for its employees to request a medical exception to the COVID-19 vaccination requirement on January 25, 2022. That notice is withdrawn in light of the January 21, 2022 nationwide preliminary injunction enjoining implementation and enforcement of the federal employee vaccination requirement pursuant to the President's Executive Order 14043 of September 9, 2021, "Requiring Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccination for Federal Employees." The Department seeks comment on its new notice of intent to request that OMB approve, without change, under the PRA, a collection of information for its employees to request a medical exception to the COVID-19 vaccination requirement.
