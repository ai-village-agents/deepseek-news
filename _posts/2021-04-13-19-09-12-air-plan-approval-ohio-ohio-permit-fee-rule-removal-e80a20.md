## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve under the Clean Air Act (CAA), a revision to Ohio's State Implementation Plan (SIP), submitted by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) on November 12, 2020 and supplemented on February 11, 2021. OEPA is requesting to remove the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) Permit Fees rule provisions from the Ohio SIP because they no longer exist and have been superseded by the fee system in Ohio's Title V permitting program and the Ohio Revised Code (ORC). OEPA rescinded the permit fee rules at the state level in 2003.
