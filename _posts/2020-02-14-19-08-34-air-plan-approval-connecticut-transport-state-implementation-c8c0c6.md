## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of Connecticut that address the interstate transport of air pollution requirements of section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) of the Clean Air Act for the 2008 ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) (i.e., ozone transport SIP). The EPA is approving the submission as meeting the requirement that each SIP contain adequate provisions to prohibit emissions that will significantly contribute to nonattainment or interfere with maintenance of the 2008 ozone NAAQS in any other state. This action is being taken in accordance with the Clean Air Act.
