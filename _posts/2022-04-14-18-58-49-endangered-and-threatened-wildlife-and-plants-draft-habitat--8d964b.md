## Summary

On April 8, 2022, we, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, published a notice announcing the availability for public comment of a draft habitat conservation plan (HCP) and draft categorical exclusion (CatEx) for activities associated with an application for an incidental take permit. Our notice inadvertently did not give the correct web address for obtaining documents for review. In addition, it published with out-of-date telecommunications relay services information. In this notice, we correct those errors.
