## Summary

HUD's regulations provide for HUD to periodically publish in the Federal Register a notice that lists sources of income specifically excluded by any Federal statute from consideration as income for purposes of determining eligibility or benefits in a HUD program. HUD last published a notice that listed federally mandated exclusions from consideration of income on May 20, 2014. This notice replaces the previously published version, adds new exclusions, and removes exclusions that are now codified in HUD regulations.
