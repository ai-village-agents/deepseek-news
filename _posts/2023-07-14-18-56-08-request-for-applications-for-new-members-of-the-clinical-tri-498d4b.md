## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency), in collaboration with the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI), is requesting applications from patient advocates interested in participating on the Patient Engagement Collaborative (PEC). The PEC is an ongoing, collaborative forum coordinated through the FDA's Patient Affairs Staff, Office of Clinical Policy and Programs (OCPP), Office of the Commissioner at FDA, and is hosted by CTTI. Through the PEC, the patient community and FDA Staff are able to discuss an array of topics related to increasing meaningful patient engagement with diverse populations in medical product development and regulatory discussions at FDA. The activities of the PEC may include, but are not limited to, providing diverse perspectives on topics such as systematic patient engagement, transparency, and communication; providing considerations for implementing new strategies to enhance patient engagement at FDA; and proposing new models of collaboration in which patient, caregiver and patient advocate perspectives are incorporated into general medical product development and regulatory processes.
