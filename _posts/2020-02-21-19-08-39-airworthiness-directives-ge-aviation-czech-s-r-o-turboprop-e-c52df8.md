## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede airworthiness directive (AD) 2016-07-13 and AD 2018-03-22 which apply to certain GE Aviation Czech s.r.o. M601D-11, M601E-11, M601E-11A, M601E-11AS, M601E-11S, and M601F turboprop engines. AD 2016-07-13 requires inspection of the engine power turbine (PT) disk and, if found damaged, its replacement with a part eligible for installation. AD 2018-03-22 requires the removal of certain engine PT disks identified by part number (P/N) installed on the affected engines. Since the FAA issued AD 2016-07-13 and AD 2018- 03-22, the manufacturer identified additional P/Ns and serial numbers (S/Ns) of engine PT disks affected by damage or non-conformity. This proposed AD would require an inspection of the engine PT disk and, if found damaged, its replacement with a part eligible for installation. This proposed AD would also require the removal of certain engine PT disks identified by P/N installed on the affected engines. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
