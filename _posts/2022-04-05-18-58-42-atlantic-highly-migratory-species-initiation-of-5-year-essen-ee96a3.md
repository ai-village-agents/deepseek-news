## Summary

NMFS announces the initiation of a 5-year review of EFH for Atlantic highly migratory species (HMS) under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act). Consistent with the regulatory provision stating that NMFS should periodically review and revise or amend the EFH provisions as warranted based on available information, the purpose of the 5-year review is to evaluate the EFH provisions of the 2006 Consolidated Atlantic HMS Fishery Management Plan (FMP) and determine whether updates to Atlantic HMS EFH are warranted. The review will be based on the best information or data available regarding Atlantic HMS and their habitats. NMFS requests public submissions of information that was not previously included in recent updates to Atlantic HMS EFH or has become available since publication of Final Amendment 10 to the 2006 Consolidated Atlantic HMS FMP (Amendment 10), which reviewed and updated HMS EFH in 2017.
