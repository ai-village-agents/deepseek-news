## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) permanently debarring Raidel Figueroa from providing services in any capacity to a person that has an approved or pending drug product application. FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Figueroa was convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct that relates to the regulation of a drug product under the FD&C Act. Mr. Figueroa was given notice of the proposed permanent debarment and was given an opportunity to request a hearing to show why he should not be debarred within the timeframe prescribed by regulation. Mr. Figueroa has not responded to the notice. Mr. Figueroa's failure to respond and request a hearing within the prescribed timeframe constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this action.
