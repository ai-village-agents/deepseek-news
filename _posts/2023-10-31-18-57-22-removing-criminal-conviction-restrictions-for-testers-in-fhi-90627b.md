## Summary

Through this proposed rule, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) seeks to eliminate the tester restrictions for Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) grantees and for Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP) agencies that forbid FHIP and FHAP recipients from using fair housing testers with prior felony convictions or convictions of crimes involving fraud or perjury. This proposed rule would make HUD's programs as inclusive as possible for people with criminal records, consistent with Secretary Marcia Fudge's April 12, 2022 Memorandum, "Eliminating Barriers That May Unnecessarily Prevent Individuals with Criminal Histories from Participating in HUD Program," and ensure that FHIP and FHAP funded entities are able to fully investigate criminal background screening policies that are potentially discriminatory under federal civil rights laws by using testers with actual criminal backgrounds.
