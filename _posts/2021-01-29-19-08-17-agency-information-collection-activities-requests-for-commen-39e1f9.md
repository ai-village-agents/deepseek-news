## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves the gathering of information necessary for the FAA to ensure proposed outdoor laser operations will not interfere with air traffic operations. The information to be collected will be used to and/or is necessary because the FAA must evaluate proposed outdoor laser operations requiring a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) variance from a laser light show, display, or device.
