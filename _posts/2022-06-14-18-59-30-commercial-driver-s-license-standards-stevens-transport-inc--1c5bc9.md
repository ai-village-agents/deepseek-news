## Summary

FMCSA announces that Stevens Transport, Inc. (Stevens) has applied for an exemption from the provisions in our regulations that require a commercial learner's permit (CLP) holder to be accompanied by a commercial driver's license (CDL) holder with the proper CDL class and endorsements seated in the front seat of the vehicle while the CLP holder performs behind-the-wheel training on public roads or highways. The exemption would allow a CLP holder who has passed the skills test but not yet received the CDL document to drive a Stevens commercial motor vehicle (CMV) accompanied by a CDL holder who is not necessarily in the passenger seat, provided the driver has documentation of passing the skills test. FMCSA requests public comment on the applicant's request for exemption.
