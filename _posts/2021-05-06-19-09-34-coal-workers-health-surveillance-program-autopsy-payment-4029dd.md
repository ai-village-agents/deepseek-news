## Summary

With this final rule, HHS amends existing regulatory text to allow compensation for pathologists who perform autopsies on coal miners at a market rate, on a discretionary basis as needed for public health purposes. HHS has determined that the agency needs additional time to consider the public comments received on the addition of procedures for suspending or revoking B Reader certification, as proposed in the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding this final rule; those procedures will be finalized at a later date.
