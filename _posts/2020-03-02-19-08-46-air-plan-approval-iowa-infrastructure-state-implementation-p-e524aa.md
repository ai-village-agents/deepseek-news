## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve certain elements of a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submission from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) addressing the applicable requirements of section 110 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) for the 2015 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Section 110 requires that each state adopt and submit a SIP revision to support the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of each new or revised NAAQS promulgated by the EPA. These SIPs are commonly referred to as "infrastructure" SIPs. The infrastructure requirements are designed to ensure that the structural components of each state's air quality management program are adequate to meet the State's responsibilities under the CAA. In this action, the EPA is proposing to approve the interstate transport portions of the State's 2015 Ozone NAAQS infrastructure SIP submittal.
