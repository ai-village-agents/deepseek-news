## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing the results of the residual risk and technology review (RTR) for the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for the Cyanide Chemicals Manufacturing source category as required under the Clean Air Act (CAA). We are proposing to find that risk from emissions of air toxics from this source category is acceptable, and that the current standards provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health. We are also proposing to find that there are no developments in practices, processes, and control technologies, and, as such, we are not proposing any development-based changes to the current standards pursuant to the technology review. The EPA is, however, proposing new emissions standards to address emissions from process wastewater at existing sources. We are proposing to amend provisions addressing startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM), to add electronic reporting, and to update the reporting and recordkeeping requirements. We do not expect these proposed amendments to result in changes in emissions from the source category but anticipate improved monitoring, compliance, and implementation of the existing standards.
