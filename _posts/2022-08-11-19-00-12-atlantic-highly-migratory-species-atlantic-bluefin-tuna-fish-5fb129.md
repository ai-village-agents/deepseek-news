## Summary

NMFS closes the General category fishery for large medium and giant (i.e., measuring 73 inches (185 cm) curved fork length or greater) Atlantic bluefin tuna (BFT) for the remainder of the June through August subquota time period. This action applies to Atlantic Tunas General category (commercial) permitted vessels and HMS Charter/ Headboat permitted vessels with a commercial sale endorsement when fishing commercially for BFT. This action also waives the previously- scheduled restricted fishing days (RFDs) for the remainder of the June through August subquota time period. With the RFDs waived during the closure, fishermen aboard General category permitted vessels and HMS Charter/Headboat permitted vessels may tag and release BFT of all sizes, subject to the requirements of the catch-and-release and tag- and-release programs. The fishery will reopen automatically and previously scheduled RFDs for September will resume.
