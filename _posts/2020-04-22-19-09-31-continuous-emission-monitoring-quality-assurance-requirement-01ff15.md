## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is amending the emissions reporting regulations applicable to sources that monitor and report emissions under the Acid Rain Program, the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), and/or the NO<INF>X</INF> SIP Call. The amendments provide that if an affected unit fails to complete a required quality-assurance, certification or recertification, fuel analysis, or emission rate test by the applicable deadline under the regulations because of travel, plant access, or other safety restrictions implemented to address the current COVID-19 national emergency and if the unit's actual monitored data would be considered valid if not for the delayed test, the unit may temporarily continue to report actual monitored data instead of substitute data. Sources must maintain documentation, notify EPA when a test is delayed and later completed, and certify to EPA that they meet the criteria for using the amended reporting procedures. Substitute data must be reported if those criteria are not met or if monitored data are missing or are invalid for any non-emergency-related reason. Units are required to complete any delayed tests as soon as practicable after relevant emergency-related restrictions no longer apply, and the emergency period for which a unit can report valid data under the amendments is limited to the duration of the COVID-19 national emergency plus a grace period of 60 days to complete delayed tests, but no later than the date of expiration of the amendments. This action is necessary during the COVID-19 national emergency to protect on-site power plant operators and other essential personnel from unnecessary risk of exposure to the coronavirus. The amendments do not suspend emissions monitoring or reporting requirements or alter emissions standards under any program, and EPA expects the amendments not to cause any change in emissions levels. The rule therefore will not result in any harm to public health or the environment that might occur from increased emissions, and to the extent that the amendments facilitate plant operators' efforts to comply with travel and plant access restrictions imposed to protect public health during the COVID- 19 emergency, the amendments will have a positive impact on public health by assisting efforts to slow the spread of the disease. EPA finds good cause to promulgate this rule without prior notice or opportunity for public comment and to make the rule effective immediately upon publication in the Federal Register. The amendments promulgated in this rule will expire in 180 days. EPA is also requesting comment on this rule.
