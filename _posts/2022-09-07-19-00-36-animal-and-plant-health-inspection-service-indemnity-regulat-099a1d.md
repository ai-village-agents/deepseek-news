# Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Indemnity Regulations

## Summary

We are soliciting public comment on a new approach to indemnity value determination and a new framework for the indemnity regulations. These parts address payment of indemnity for the destruction and disposition of animals the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) classifies as infected with, suspect of, or exposed to diseases of concern, to eradicate and control foreign animal diseases, emerging diseases, and program diseases. The current regulations for valuing animals for the purpose of indemnification vary from species to species and, in some cases, disease to disease within a species. The new approach would harmonize how APHIS determines animal values and deals with costs associated with transportation, cleaning, disposal, and other points at which variations occur in how APHIS manages indemnity and compensation.
