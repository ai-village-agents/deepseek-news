## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce findings that one species is not warranted for delisting and six species are not warranted for listing as endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). After a thorough review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that it is not warranted at this time to delist the southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis). We also find that is not warranted at this time to list the Cascades frog (Rana cascadae), plains spotted skunk (Spilogale interrupta, formerly recognized as one of three subspecies of eastern spotted skunk (Spilogale putorius interrupta)), sicklefin chub (Macrhybopsis meeki), sturgeon chub (Macrhybopsis gelida), Tennessee cave salamander (Gyrinophilus palleucus), and Yazoo crayfish (Faxonius hartfieldi, formerly Orconectes hartfieldi). However, we ask the public to submit to us at any time any new information relevant to the status of any of the species mentioned above or their habitats.
