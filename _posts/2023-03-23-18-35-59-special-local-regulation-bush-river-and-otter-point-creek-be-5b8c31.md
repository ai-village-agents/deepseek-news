## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary special local regulation for certain waters of the Bush River and Otter Point Creek, in Maryland. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters located at Edgewood, MD, during a high-speed power boat race on May 13, 2023 and May 14, 2023. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels (other than those already at berth at the time the regulation takes effect) from being in the regulated area unless authorized by the Captain of the Port, Sector Maryland-National Capital Region (COTP), or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
