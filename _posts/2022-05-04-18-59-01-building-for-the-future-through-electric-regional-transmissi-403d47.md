## Summary

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) proposes to reform both the pro forma Open Access Transmission Tariff and the pro forma Large Generator Interconnection Agreement to remedy deficiencies in the Commission's existing regional transmission planning and cost allocation requirements. Specifically, the proposal would require public utility transmission providers to; conduct long- term regional transmission planning on a sufficiently forward-looking basis to meet transmission needs driven by changes in the resource mix and demand; more fully consider dynamic line ratings and advanced power flow control devices in regional transmission planning processes; seek the agreement of relevant state entities within the transmission planning region regarding the cost allocation method or methods that will apply to transmission facilities selected in the regional transmission plan for purposes of cost allocation through long-term regional transmission planning; adopt enhanced transparency requirements for local transmission planning processes and improve coordination between regional and local transmission planning with the aim of identifying potential opportunities to "right-size" replacement transmission facilities; and revise their existing interregional transmission coordination procedures to reflect the long- term regional transmission planning reforms proposed in this NOPR. In addition, the proposal would not permit public utility transmission providers to take advantage of the construction-work-in-progress incentive for regional transmission facilities selected for purposes of cost allocation through long-term regional transmission planning and would permit the exercise of federal rights of first refusal for transmission facilities selected in a regional transmission plan for purposes of cost allocation, conditioned on the incumbent transmission provider with the federal right of first refusal for such regional transmission facilities establishing joint ownership of the transmission facilities.
