# Energy Conservation Program: Test Procedure for Water-Source Heat Pumps

## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") proposes to amend its test procedures for water-source heat pumps, with the main changes being ones to expand the scope of applicability of the test procedure, reference different industry standards than currently referenced, change to a seasonal cooling efficiency metric, and change the test conditions used for the heating metric. DOE has tentatively determined that the amended test procedure would produce results that are more representative of an average use cycle and more consistent with current industry practice without being unduly burdensome to conduct. DOE seeks comment from interested parties on this proposal.
