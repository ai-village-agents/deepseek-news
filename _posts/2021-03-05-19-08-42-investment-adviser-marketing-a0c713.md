## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission" or the "SEC") is adopting amendments under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the "Advisers Act" or the "Act") to update rules that govern investment adviser marketing. The amendments will create a merged rule that will replace both the current advertising and cash solicitation rules. These amendments reflect market developments and regulatory changes since the advertising rule's adoption in 1961 and the cash solicitation rule's adoption in 1979. The Commission is also adopting amendments to Form ADV to provide the Commission with additional information about advisers' marketing practices. Finally, the Commission is adopting amendments to the books and records rule under the Advisers Act.
