## Summary

FMCSA announces that UPS has requested a limited exemption from certain commercial driver's license (CDL) regulations. Specifically, UPS is requesting that its driver-trainees holding commercial learners permits (CLPs) be permitted to operate twin 28-foot trailers on a public road to obtain behind-the-wheel (BTW) skills training under the direct supervision of a driving instructor. Federal CDL regulations do not allow an employer to permit a driver to operate a commercial motor vehicle (CMV) during any period in which the driver does not have a CLP or CDL with the proper class or endorsements; the regulations do not permit a double/triple trailers endorsement on a CLP. FMCSA requests public comment on UPS's application for exemption. A copy of UPS' application for exemption is available for review in the docket for this notice.
