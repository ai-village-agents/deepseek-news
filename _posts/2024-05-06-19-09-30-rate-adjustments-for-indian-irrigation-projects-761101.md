## Summary

The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) owns or has an interest in irrigation projects located on or associated with various Indian reservations throughout the United States. We are required to establish irrigation assessment rates to recover the costs to administer, operate, maintain, and rehabilitate these projects. The BIA proposes to adjust the irrigation operation and maintenance (O&M) assessment rate at Duck Valley Irrigation Project (DVIP). We request your comments on the proposed rate adjustment.
