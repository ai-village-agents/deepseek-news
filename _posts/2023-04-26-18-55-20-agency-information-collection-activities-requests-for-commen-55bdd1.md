## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew Information Collection 2120-0768. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on January 6, 2023 (88 FR 91105). The FAA proposes renewal of the collection of information related to requests made under 14 CFR part 107 to operate small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) in controlled airspace. FAA will use the collected information to make determinations whether to authorize or deny the requested operation of UAS in controlled airspace. The proposed information collection is necessary to issue such authorizations or denials consistent with the FAA's mandate to ensure safe and efficient use of national airspace. The FAA received no comments to the 60-day notice. This is a corrected Federal Register Notice to update a Federal Register Notice posted on April 20, 2023 under Docket Number 2022-0176. This corrected Federal Register Notice updates the Docket Number to FAA-2023-1035.
