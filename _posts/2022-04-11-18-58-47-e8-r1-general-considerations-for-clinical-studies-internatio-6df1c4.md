## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled "E8(R1) General Considerations for Clinical Studies." The guidance was prepared under the auspices of the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH), formerly the International Conference on Harmonisation. The guidance describes internationally accepted principles and practices for the design and conduct of clinical studies of drug and biological products. In addition, the guidance provides an overview of the types of clinical studies that may be performed and data sources used during the product's life cycle. The guidance is intended to promote the quality of the studies submitted to regulatory authorities, while allowing for flexibility. This guidance revises the guidance for industry "E8 General Considerations for Clinical Trials" issued in December 1997.
