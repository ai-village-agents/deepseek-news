## Summary

The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) is proposing to issue regulations to be followed when an NEH employee receives a demand or request to provide testimony or produce records in a legal proceeding. These procedures are designed to promote economy and efficiency in NEH's programs and operations, to minimize the possibility of involving NEH in controversial issues not related to its functions, to maintain the impartiality of NEH among private litigants, and to protect sensitive, confidential information and the deliberative process.
