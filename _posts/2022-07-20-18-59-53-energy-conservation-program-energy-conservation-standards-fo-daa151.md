## Summary

On May 19, 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE or the Department) published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking and announcement of public meeting regarding energy conservation standards for commercial water heaters. DOE received three requests to extend the public comment period by 60 days. DOE has reviewed and denied these requests. But, considering the particular circumstances of DOE's denial of these petitions, the Department is reopening the public comment period to allow comments to be submitted until August 1, 2022.
