# Energy Conservation Program: Test Procedure for Direct Heating Equipment

## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) proposes to amend the test procedure for direct heating equipment (DHE) to incorporate by reference the most recent versions of the industry consensus test standards currently referenced in the Federal test procedure. DOE also proposes to update definitions regarding unvented heaters, account for multiple operational modes, specify the allowable measurement error for oil pressure, specify the use of manufacturer values for gas supply pressure in certain circumstances, reduce the number of thermocouples required in the thermocouple grid for models with small flues, and clarify instructions for calculations regarding condensate mass measurements. DOE welcomes written comment from the public on any subject within the scope of this document (including topics not raised in this proposal), as well as submission of data and other relevant information.
