## Summary

On July 15, 2020, HUD published a notice ("HCV Mobility Demonstration Notice") implementing the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) mobility demonstration ("HCV mobility demonstration") authorized by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019. Through that Notice, HUD is making available up to $50,000,000 to participating Public Housing Agencies ("PHAs") throughout the country to implement housing mobility programs by offering mobility-related services to increase the number of voucher families with children living in opportunity areas. HUD now supplements the July 15, 2020 notice to partially restrict participation in both the HCV mobility demonstration program and the Moving to Work demonstration expansion ("MTW expansion") program. These restrictions are necessary to ensure the integrity of the Congressionally-mandated evaluations of both demonstrations. This notice also provides two minor technical corrections to definitions provided in the July 15, 2020, HCV Mobility Demonstration Notice.
