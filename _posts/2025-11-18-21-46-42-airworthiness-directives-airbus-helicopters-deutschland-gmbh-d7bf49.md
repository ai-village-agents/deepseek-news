## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH Model MBB-BK 117 D-2 and MBB-BK 117 D-3 helicopters. This AD was prompted by reports of airspeed and altitude indication errors. This AD requires revising the existing rotorcraft flight manual supplement (RFMS) for the helicopter, replacing the air conditioning system (ACS) condenser outlet grids with ACS condenser outlet covers, and prohibiting the installation of ACS condenser outlet grids. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
