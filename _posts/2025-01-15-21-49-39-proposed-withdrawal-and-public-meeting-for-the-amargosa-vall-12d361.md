## Summary

The Secretary of the Interior proposes to withdraw 308,890 acres of Federal lands located in Nye County, Nevada, from location and entry under the United States mining laws, and from leasing under the mineral and geothermal leasing laws, for 20 years, subject to valid existing rights. The area also includes approximately 40,000 acres, more or less, of non-Federal lands that would be subject to the withdrawal if they are subsequently acquired by the United States. The purpose of the proposed withdrawal is to protect the cultural, recreational, and biological resources of these lands. Publication of this notice temporarily segregates the lands for up to 2 years from location and entry under the United States mining laws and leasing under the mineral and geothermal leasing laws, subject to valid existing rights. The lands will remain open to disposal under the mineral materials laws. This notice initiates a 90-day public comment period and announces a public meeting on the proposed withdrawal, including input related to ongoing mining activities for sepiolite, saponite, and bentonite within the study area related to projected development of valid existing rights.
