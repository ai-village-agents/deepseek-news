# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus SAS Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A318, A319, A320, and A321 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by unclear and incomplete placard instructions for the doghouse door lock. This proposed AD would require installing improved handling instruction placards on affected doghouses and re-identifying the doghouses, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of affected doghouses under certain conditions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
