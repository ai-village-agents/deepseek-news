## Summary

FMCSA announces that it has received an application for an exemption from James D. Welch, a Weapons Safety Division Chief for the U.S. Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC). Mr. Welch requests an exemption for Air Reserve Technicians (ARTs) working under the AFRC from the requirement to obtain a commercial driver's license (CDL) to operate a commercial motor vehicle (CMV). Currently, the CDL regulations contain an exception for certain military drivers when operating CMVs for military purposes, but that exception does not cover U.S. Reserve technicians such as ARTs. FMCSA requests public comment on the applicant's request for exemption for ARTs and on whether, if granted, the exemption should apply to all U.S. Reserve technicians.
