## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Emerging Infections Program (EIP). The EIP is a population-based surveillance program that collects data via active, laboratory case findings and is used for detecting, identifying, and monitoring emerging pathogens.
