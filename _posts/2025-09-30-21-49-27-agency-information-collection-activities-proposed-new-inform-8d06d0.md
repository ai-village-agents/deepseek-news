## Summary

The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), as part of its obligations under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), invites the general public and other Federal agencies to take this opportunity to comment on a proposed information collection, a Survey of the Costs of Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) Compliance. The survey seeks to gather information on the direct compliance costs incurred by non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), described below, with AML/CFT compliance requirements and, to the extent these expenses overlap with those of other activities (such as fraud monitoring), the amount attributable to AML/CFT compliance. FinCEN is seeking a new Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Control Number for this information collection.
