## Summary

As a result of the determinations by the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) orders on steel wire garment hangers (hangers) from Taiwan and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (Vietnam), and the countervailing duty (CVD) order on hangers from Vietnam would likely lead to the continuation or recurrence of dumping, countervailable subsidies, and material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation of these AD orders and this CVD order.
