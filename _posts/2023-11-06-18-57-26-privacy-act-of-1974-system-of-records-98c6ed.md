## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA or Agency) Personnel Security Branch (PSB) is giving notice that it proposes to modify a system of records pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. The Personnel Security System (PSS) 2.0 is being modified to include a new module, which the Agency will use to administer its Insider Threat Program. The new module will collect records about individuals to assist the Agency with insider threat inquiry management and coordination. The module will retain insider threat inquiry-related data and help EPA personnel coordinate responses to those inquiries. Collecting this data ensures the effective and timely processing of records.
