## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled "Research Involving Children as Subjects and Not Otherwise Approvable by an IRB: Process for Referrals to FDA and OHRP." This guidance is intended to assist institutional review boards (IRBs), institutions, investigators, and sponsors in understanding the processes used for review of research involving children as subjects that is not otherwise approvable by an IRB and has been referred to FDA, the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), or both, for review. When final, this guidance will replace the final guidance issued by FDA in December 2006 entitled, "Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards and Sponsors: Process for Handing Referrals to FDA Under 21 CFR 50.54: Additional Safeguards for Children in Clinical Investigations" and the guidance issued by the OHRP entitled "Children as Research Subjects and the HHS `407' Process," issued on May 26, 2005. This draft guidance is not final nor is it in effect at this time.
