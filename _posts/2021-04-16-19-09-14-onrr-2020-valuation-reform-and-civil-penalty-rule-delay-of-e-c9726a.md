## Summary

ONRR is delaying the effective date of the final rule entitled "ONRR 2020 Valuation Reform and Civil Penalty Rule" ("2020 Rule") from April 16, 2021 to November 1, 2021. The purpose of this second delay is to avoid placing undue regulatory burdens on lessees caused by allowing the 2020 Rule to go into effect while ONRR considers whether it will revise or withdraw some or all of that rule due to apparent defects in that rule.
