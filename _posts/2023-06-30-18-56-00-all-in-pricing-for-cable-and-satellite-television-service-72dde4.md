# All-In Pricing for Cable and Satellite Television Service

## Summary

In this document, The Federal Communications Commission (Commission) propose to require cable operators and direct broadcast satellite providers to clearly and prominently display the total cost of video programming service in promotional materials and on subscribers' bills. Requiring "all-in" pricing is intended to clearly and accurately reflect consumers' subscription payment obligations, eliminate unexpected fees, and allow consumers to comparison shop among competing cable operators and direct broadcast satellite providers as well as alternative programming providers like streaming services. We also seek comment on the effect of imposing such requirements on other types of multichannel video programming distributors and on our authority to do so.
