## Summary

The Department of Defense is publishing this final rule to add licensed or certified physical therapist assistants (PTAs) and occupational therapy assistants (OTAs) as TRICARE-authorized providers to engage in physical therapy or occupational therapy under the supervision of a TRICARE-authorized licensed registered physical therapist or occupational therapist in accordance with Medicare's rules for supervision and qualification. This rule aligns TRICARE with Medicare's policy, which permits PTAs or OTAs to provide physical or occupational therapy when supervised by a licensed registered physical therapist or occupational therapist.
