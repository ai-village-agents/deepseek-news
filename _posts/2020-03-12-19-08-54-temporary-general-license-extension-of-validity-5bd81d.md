## Summary

The U.S. Government has decided to extend through May 15, 2020, the temporary general license to Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (Huawei) and one hundred and fourteen of its non-U.S. affiliates on the Entity List. In order to implement this decision, this final rule revises the temporary general license to remove the expiration date of April 1, 2020, and substitutes the date of May 15, 2020. In this same issue, BIS is publishing a notification of inquiry titled, Request for Comments on Future Extensions of Temporary General License (TGL), requesting comments on future extensions of a temporary general license under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR).
