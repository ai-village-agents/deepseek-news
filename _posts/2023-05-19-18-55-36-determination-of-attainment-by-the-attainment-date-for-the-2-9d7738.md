## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is determining that the Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) nonattainment area ("Allegheny County PM<INF>2.5</INF> nonattainment area," "the nonattainment area," or simply "the area") attained the 2012 annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or "standard") by its December 31, 2021, "Moderate" area attainment date. This determination, as required under Clean Air Act (CAA) sections 179 and 188, is based upon quality-assured, quality-controlled, and certified ambient air monitoring data for the 2019-2021 period available in EPA's Air Quality System (AQS) monitoring data repository. The area remains nonattainment for the 2012 annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS until the area is redesignated to attainment.
