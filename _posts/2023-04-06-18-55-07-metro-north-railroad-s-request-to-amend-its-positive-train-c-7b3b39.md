## Summary

This document provides the public with notice that, on March 3 and 15, 2023, Metro-North Railroad (MNR) submitted a request for amendment (RFA) to its FRA-certified positive train control (PTC) system, the Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System II (ACSES II), in order to support the construction of a new interlocking at Control Point 243 and associated adjacent signal system changes on MNR's New Haven Line in the vicinity of Norwalk, CT. The RFA proposes to establish an ACSES II Construction Zone (CZ) through the installation of transponders during the interlocking construction. This RFA does not propose any changes to safety critical elements of the ACSES II PTC system.
