## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. This revision was submitted by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP), on behalf of the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD), to establish and require reasonably available control technology (RACT) for sources at PPG Industries Springdale Plant (PPG Springdale), a major source of volatile organic compounds (VOC), pursuant to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's conditionally approved RACT regulations. In this action, EPA is approving source-specific RACT determinations (case-by-case or CbC) submitted by PADEP for certain VOC sources at PPG Springdale, a facility in Allegheny County. This RACT evaluation was submitted to meet RACT requirements for the 2008 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS). EPA is approving this revision to the Pennsylvania SIP in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and EPA's implementing regulations.
