## Summary

The National Institute of Justice (NIJ) is soliciting information in an upcoming Criminal Justice Testing and Evaluation Consortium (CJTEC) report that will provide a functional overview of how criminal justice stakeholders (i.e., law enforcement, courts, and correctional agencies) can implement chatbots. This report is a follow- on to Chatbots in the Criminal Justice System; a report that provides an overview of chatbot technology and examples in the criminal justice system. This RFI is seeking information about best practices for the development and implementation of chatbots in the criminal justice system. The resulting report will educate criminal justice agencies on implementation pathways and will highlight selected chatbot developers and providers with previous experience specific to the criminal justice system or local government. The goal of the report is to be a resource for stakeholders to reference when considering their chatbot development plans.
