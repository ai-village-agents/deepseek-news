## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC" or "Commission") is announcing an opportunity for public comment on the proposed renewal of the collection of certain information by the agency. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act ("PRA"), Federal agencies are required to publish notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of information and to allow 60 days for public comment. This notice solicits comments in connection with information collection requirements under certain rules and related forms (the "final rules") that the Commission adopted to enhance its identification of futures and swap market participants.
