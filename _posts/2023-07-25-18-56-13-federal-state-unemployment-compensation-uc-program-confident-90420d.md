## Summary

The U.S. Department of Labor (Department or USDOL) invites interested parties to provide information relating to the disclosure of confidential wage records under the Department's regulations governing the confidentiality and disclosure of State UC information. The Department is considering comprehensive updates to the UC confidentiality regulations and the information received in response to this RFI will inform and be considered by the Department as it reviews the UC confidentiality regulations, which may result in the development of a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to revise the regulations in a manner that would address the evolution of both information technology (IT) and the public workforce system as these changes relate to the required and permissible disclosure of confidential UC data.
