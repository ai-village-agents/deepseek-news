## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD or "the District") portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) as SIP strengthening. This revision concerns emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) and particulate matter (PM) from indirect sources associated with warehouses. The EPA is proposing to approve SCAQMD Rule 2305, "Warehouse Indirect Source Rule--Warehouse Actions and Investments to Reduce Emissions (WAIRE) Program," to regulate these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act). The EPA is taking comments on this proposal and plans to follow with a final action.
