## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice announces the intention of the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) to request revision and extension of a currently approved information collection, the Agricultural Resources Management Survey (ARMS), phases 1 and 2 as well as Chemical Use Surveys. All phases of the Agricultural Resources Management Survey(s) are included in the current OMB Control Number 0535-0218, but this information collection renewal request will only include the ARMS phases 1 and 2 as well as Chemical Use Surveys. The ARMS phase 3 surveys will be moved to a separate information collection request. Splitting these surveys across multiple information collections will allow USDA and cooperators more flexibility for changes to best address current trends in the farming industry. A revision to burden hours will be needed due to this separation as well as changes in the size of the target population, sampling design, and/or questionnaire length.
