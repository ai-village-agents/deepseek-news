# Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Removal of Virginia Sneezeweed From the List of Endangered and Threatened Plants

## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to remove Virginia sneezeweed (Helenium virginicum) from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Plants. Our review indicates that the threats to Virginia sneezeweed have been eliminated or reduced to the point that the species no longer meets the definition of an endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Accordingly, we propose to delist Virginia sneezeweed. If we finalize this rule as proposed, the prohibitions and conservation measures provided by the Act, particularly through sections 7 and 9, would no longer apply to Virginia sneezeweed.
