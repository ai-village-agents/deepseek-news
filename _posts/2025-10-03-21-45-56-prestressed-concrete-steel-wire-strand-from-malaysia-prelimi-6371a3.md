## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping duty (AD) order on prestressed concrete steel wire strand (PC strand) from Malaysia for the period of review (POR) June 1, 2023, through May 31, 2024. Commerce preliminarily finds that Kiswire Sdn. Bhd. (Kiswire) and Wei Dat Steel Wire Sdn. Bhd. (Wei Dat) did not make sales of subject merchandise at prices below normal value (NV) during the POR. Additionally, we are rescinding this review, in part, with respect to one company for which there were no reviewable entries of subject merchandise during the POR. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.
