## Summary

The Federal Maritime Commission ("Commission") is revoking certain exemptions that allow for rates, charges, classifications, rules or regulations to become effective with less than thirty (30) days' notice. These exemptions have been granted to some controlled carriers. This revocation will apply to exemptions that were granted to entities that have since been removed from the Commission's list of controlled carriers. Exemptions that have been granted to controlled carriers that remain on this list will continue to be valid but may be reviewed in the future. No comments were received from the notice of intent to revoke, and no changes have been made in this final notice. Commission Orders to the individual carriers whose exemptions are revoked are available in the Commission's electronic Reading Room at https://www2.fmc.gov/readingroom/ under Docket Numbers 25-17 through 25-23.
