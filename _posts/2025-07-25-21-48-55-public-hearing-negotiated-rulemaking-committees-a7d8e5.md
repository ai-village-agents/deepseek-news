## Summary

We announce our intention to establish two negotiated rulemaking committees to prepare regulations for the Federal student financial assistance programs authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act (HEA) of 1965, as amended (Title IV, HEA programs). One committee will consider changes to the Federal student loan programs and the other committee will consider changes to institutional and programmatic accountability, the Pell Grant Program, and other changes to the Title IV, HEA programs. This rulemaking is necessary to implement recent statutory changes to the Title IV, HEA programs included in Pub. L. 119-21, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, that President Trump signed into law on July 4, 2025, as well as to implement other Administration priorities. Prior to submitting draft regulations to the negotiated rulemaking process, the Department invites the public to provide advice and recommendations addressing the implementation of the changes to the Title IV, HEA programs included in Pub. L. 119-21 during a virtual public hearing that will be held on August 7, 2025, from 9:00 a.m. to noon and 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., Eastern time. As part of the hearing record, the Department will also accept written comments providing advice and recommendations on the implementation of the changes to the Title IV, HEA programs included in Pub. L. 119-21 through August 25, 2025.
