## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) gives notice of updated guidance for the Energy Policy Act of 2005 Hydroelectric Production Incentives. The guidance describes the hydroelectric production incentive payment requirements and explains the type of information that owners or authorized operators of qualified hydroelectric facilities must provide DOE when applying for hydroelectric production incentive payments. The hydroelectric production incentive payments are a benefit available for electric energy generated and sold for a specified 10-year period as authorized under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. In the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, DOE received $125 million to support this hydroelectric production incentive. At this time, DOE is only accepting applications from owners and authorized operators of qualified hydroelectric facilities for hydroelectricity generated and sold in calendar year 2023.
