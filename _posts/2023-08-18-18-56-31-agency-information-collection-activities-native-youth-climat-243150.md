## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, on March 10, 2023, we, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, published a notice announcing that we are proposing to revise a currently approved information collection (IC). The notice opened a public comment period, which closed on May 9, 2023. We subsequently identified additional proposed changes to the IC that were not included in the original notice; therefore, we are now republishing the notice in full, including the original and newly identified proposed changes, and reopening the comment period.
