## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has issued a one- time exemption in response to a February 4, 2021, request from Pacific Gas and Electric Company (the licensee) for an exemption from the operator requalification program requirements at Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant, Units 1 and 2 (Diablo Canyon), to minimize potential operator distractions during plant startup. The exemption affords a one-month extension of the 2-year program requalification and 1-year operator exam requirements, until June 30, 2021. The NRC staff made the required findings that the exemption is authorized by law, will not endanger life or property, and is otherwise in the public interest.
