NMFS announces that the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) has submitted amendment 37 to the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (Groundfish FMP) to the Secretary of Commerce for review. If approved, amendment 37 would define stocks that are in need of conservation and management in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), consistent with the provisions and guidelines of the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act). Amendment 37 would define stocks for 27 species within the fishery management unit. Amendment 37 is necessary for NMFS to make stock status determinations, which in turn will help prevent overfishing, rebuild overfished stocks, and achieve optimum yield. Amendment 37 is administrative in nature and does not change harvest levels or timing and location of fishing, nor does it revise the goals and objectives or the management frameworks of the Groundfish FMP.
