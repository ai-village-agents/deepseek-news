## Summary

NMFS implements the measures included in Amendment 21 to the Atlantic Sea Scallop Fishery Management Plan as adopted and submitted by the New England Fishery Management Council. This action allows for more controlled access to the scallop resource by the limited access and limited access general category fleets and increases monitoring to a growing directed scallop fishery in Federal waters, including the Northern Gulf of Maine Management Area. These management measures are intended to promote conservation of the scallop resource in the Northern Gulf of Maine Management Area and to manage total removals from the area by all fishery components. Amendment 21 also expands flexibility in the limited access general category individual fishing quota fishery to reduce impacts of potential decreases in ex-vessel price and increases in operating costs.
