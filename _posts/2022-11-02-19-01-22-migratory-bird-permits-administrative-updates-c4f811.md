# Migratory Bird Permits; Administrative Updates

**Published:** February 05, 2026 19:01 UTC

## Summary

On January 7, 2022, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) published a final rule to renumber, rename, and rearrange certain subparts and sections in our regulations. In that rule, we incorrectly presented an amendatory instruction, which prevented the complete codification of the regulatory text we set forth for one section of the regulations. In this document, we correctly set forth the amendatory instruction and the relevant regulatory text. This technical amendment is a purely administrative action; it simply corrects one amendatory instruction to codify regulations we previously published in our January 7, 2022, final rule.
