## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("Commission" or "CFTC") is proposing revisions to the Commission regulations that set forth the swap data recordkeeping and reporting requirements for swap data repositories ("SDRs"), derivatives clearing organizations ("DCOs"), swap execution facilities ("SEFs"), designated contract markets ("DCMs"), swap dealers ("SDs"), major swap participants ("MSPs"), and swap counterparties that are neither SDs nor MSPs. The Commission is proposing revisions that, among other things, streamline the requirements for reporting new swaps, define and adopt swap data elements that harmonize with international technical guidance, and reduce reporting burdens for reporting counterparties that are not SDs or MSPs.
