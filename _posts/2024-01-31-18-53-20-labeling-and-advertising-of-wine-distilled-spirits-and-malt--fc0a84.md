## Summary

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) is announcing virtual listening sessions to receive input from the public on labeling of wine, distilled spirits, and malt beverages to disclose per-serving alcohol and nutritional information, major food allergens, and/or ingredients. The Department of the Treasury's February 2022 report on "Competition in the Markets for Beer, Wine, and Spirits" recommended that TTB revive or initiate rulemaking in these areas. These listening sessions are intended to engage the public, including consumers, public health stakeholders, and industry members of all sizes, and facilitate the public's ability to provide input to inform rulemaking. This notice sets forth the dates and times of the virtual listening sessions and instructions for registration. It also opens a docket for submitting written comments on the issues to be discussed in the listening sessions.
