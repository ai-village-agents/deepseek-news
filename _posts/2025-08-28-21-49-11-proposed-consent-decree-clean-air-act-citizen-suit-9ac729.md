## Summary

In accordance with the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA or the Act), notice is given of a proposed consent decree in Center for Biological Diversity and Center for Environmental Health v. Lee Zeldin, No. 4:25-cv-03143-HSG (N.D. Cal). On April 8, 2025, Plaintiffs the Center for Biological Diversity and the Center for Environmental Health filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) failed to perform its mandatory duties in accordance with the Act to determine whether the Mariposa County, California, and Phoenix-Mesa, Arizona non-attainment areas attained the 2015 ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) by the Moderate attainment date. The EPA is providing notice of this proposed consent decree, which would resolve all claims in the case by establishing deadlines for the EPA to take final action as specified in the decree.
