## Summary

The DoD, with the concurrence of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE), proposes to amend the Supplemental Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Department of Defense (DoD Supplemental Regulation). The amendments revise and update the DoD Supplemental Regulation originally written in 1993, to supplement the OGE Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (OGE Standards). Amendments include changes in the following areas: designation of separate agency components for the purposes of gifts and teaching, speaking, and writing; additional exceptions for gifts from outside sources; additional limitations on gifts between DoD employees; and authority to waive any of the provisions of the DoD Supplemental Regulation.
