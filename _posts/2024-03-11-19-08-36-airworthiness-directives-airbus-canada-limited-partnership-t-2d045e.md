## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-09-03, which applies to certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500-1A11 airplanes. AD 2021-09-03 requires repetitive replacements of the emergency locator transmitter (ELT) antenna and repetitive inspections of the exterior fuselage skin around the ELT antenna attachment area. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-09-03, it has been reported that there was an in-service failure of an ELT antenna that occurred before the repetitive replacement interval required by AD 2021-09-03, and that a terminating action was developed. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2021-09-03 and would require replacement of the ELT antenna with a new ELT antenna, inspection of the exterior fuselage skin around the ELT antenna attachment holes, and repair if necessary, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
