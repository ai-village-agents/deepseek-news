## Summary

NMFS is proposing to modify the Letter of Authorization (LOA) that was issued to the United States Navy (Navy) on January 26, 2022 in association with construction activities related to bulkhead replacement and repairs at Naval Station Newport (NAVSTA Newport) over the course of five years (2022-2027). Necessary additions to the Navy's construction plan include vibratory driving of 30-inch (in) steel pipe piles and Down-The-Hole (DTH) driving when technically required for repairs to the S45 bulkhead facility. Pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), NMFS is proposing to modify the Navy's LOA to increase authorized take by Level B harassment for harbor seal, gray seal, and harp seals. NMFS is also proposing to include appropriate, additional shutdown mitigation provisions for all species in the modified LOA. The monitoring and reporting measures remain the same as prescribed in the initial LOA. NMFS will also consider public comments on the requested modification prior to making any final decision and agency responses will be summarized in the final notice of our decision.
