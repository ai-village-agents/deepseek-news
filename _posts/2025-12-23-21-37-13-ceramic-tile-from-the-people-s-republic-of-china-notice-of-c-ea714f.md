## Summary

On October 20, 2025, the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) issued its final judgment in Elysium Tiles, Inc. et al v. United States, Court No. 23-00041, sustaining the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce)'s second remand redetermination pertaining to the scope ruling for the antidumping duty and countervailing duty orders on ceramic tile from the People's Republic of China. Commerce is notifying the public that the CIT's final judgment is not in harmony with Commerce's scope ruling, and that Commerce is amending the scope ruling to find that Elysium Tiles, Inc. and Elysium Tile Florida, Inc. (collectively, Elysium)'s composite tile is not covered by the scope of the Orders.\1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
