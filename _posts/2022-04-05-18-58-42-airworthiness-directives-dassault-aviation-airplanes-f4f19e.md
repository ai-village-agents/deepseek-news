## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Dassault Aviation Model FALCON 7X airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a weak point identified in the Falcon 7X `EASy' avionics architecture, which, coupled with theoretical generic input/output (I/O) card failure, could lead to misleading data on display units. This proposed AD would require revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to provide emergency procedures for inconsistent or unreliable flight data and emergency and abnormal operations procedures for the GEN I/O internal module failure, and revising the operator's existing FAA-approved minimum equipment list (MEL) items for the multi-function probe heating, air data, and inertial reference systems, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. This proposed AD would also require revising the existing AFM to incorporate additional information in the emergency procedures. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
