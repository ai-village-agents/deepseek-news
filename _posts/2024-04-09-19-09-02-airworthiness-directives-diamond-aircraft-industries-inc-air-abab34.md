## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Diamond Aircraft Industries Inc. Model DA 62 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that certain revisions of the airplane maintenance manual (AMM) specified incorrect torque values for the horizontal stabilizer attachment bolts. This AD requires reviewing the airplane maintenance records to determine the torque values for the horizontal stabilizer attachment bolts and torquing the horizontal stabilizer attachment bolts to the correct torque value if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
