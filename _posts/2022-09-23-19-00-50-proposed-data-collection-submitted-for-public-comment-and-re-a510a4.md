## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Youth Outreach Generic Clearance for the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The goal of this Generic Clearance is to facilitate outreach efforts in the fields of math and science to young people (grades K through college) and those who support them.
