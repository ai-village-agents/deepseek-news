# Health Center Program Performance Period Extensions

## Summary

HRSA is extending health center grantees' performance periods to a total of 4 years. The change from a 3-year performance period to a 4-year performance period will provide current health centers additional time to serve their service area before they apply for a new award and will provide a funding amount consistent with what would have been made available through the Service Area Competition (SAC). The extended performance period supports HRSA's commitment to continuity in access to comprehensive primary care and will not impact HRSA's ability to ensure that health centers comply with Health Center Program requirements. This update will not change the statutory requirement that health centers that fail to comply with Health Center Program requirements will receive a 1-year performance period if a new project period is awarded.
