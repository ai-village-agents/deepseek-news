## Summary

In accordance with the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended, we, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, after consideration of comments received from the public, have revised the marine mammal stock assessment reports (SAR) for two West Indian manatee stocks, the Florida manatee stock (Trichechus manatus latirostris) and the Puerto Rico stock of the Antillean manatee (Trichechus manatus manatus). We now make both final revised SARs available to the public.
