## Summary

The Department of the Army (Army) announces the availability of a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (Draft EIS) regarding its Proposed Action--i.e., the Army's retention of up to approximately 23,000 acres of land the Army presently leases from the State of Hawai[revaps]i. This land is located at P[omacr]hakuloa Training Area (PTA) on the island of Hawai[revaps]i. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Hawai[revaps]i Environmental Policy Act (HEPA), the Draft EIS analyzes the potential direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of a range of reasonable alternatives that meet the purpose of and need for the Proposed Action. The Draft EIS also analyzes the potential impacts of the No-Action Alternative, under which Army use of the land would cease altogether when the lease runs out in 2029. Because the proposed retention involves state-owned land, the EIS is a joint NEPA-HEPA document. Therefore, the public review process runs concurrently and meets NEPA and HEPA requirements.
