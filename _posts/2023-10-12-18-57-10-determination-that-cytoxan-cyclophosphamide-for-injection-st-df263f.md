## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency) has determined that the sterile dry powder excipient-free formulation of CYTOXAN (cyclophosphamide) for Injection, 500 milligrams (mg)/vial, 1 gram (g)/vial, and 2 g/vial, and the sterile dry powder with sodium chloride formulation of CYTOXAN (cyclophosphamide) for Injection, 500 mg/vial, 1 g/vial, and 2 g/vial, were not withdrawn from sale for reasons of safety or effectiveness. This determination means that FDA will not begin procedures to withdraw approval of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) that refer to the sterile dry powder excipient- free formulation or the sterile dry powder with sodium chloride formulation of these drug products, and it will allow FDA to continue to approve ANDAs that refer to these formulations of CYTOXAN as long as they meet relevant legal and regulatory requirements.
