## Summary

The Department of Commerce (Commerce) continues to find that the respondents selected for individual examination, Bioparques De Occidente, S.A. de C.V. and its affiliates (Bioparques), Del Campo Y Asociados SA de CV and its affiliates (Del Campo), and Productora Agricola Industrial del Noroeste, SA de CV and its affiliates (Productora Agricola), (collectively mandatory respondents), were generally in compliance with the terms of the Agreement Suspending the Antidumping Duty Investigation on Fresh Tomatoes from Mexico (2019 Agreement) during the period of review (POR) from September 19, 2019, through August 31, 2020, with the exception of certain instances of non-compliance. Commerce continues to find such instances of non- compliance to be inconsequential and/or inadvertent, and thus not violations under the 2019 Agreement, and that the 2019 Agreement is meeting the statutory requirements under sections 734(c) and (d) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act).
