## Summary

This document amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regulations to reflect an extension of import restrictions on certain categories of archaeological and ethnological materials of Libya. The Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States Department of State, has made the requisite determinations for extending the import restrictions and no cause for suspension exists. The restrictions, originally imposed by CBP Decision (CBP Dec.) 18-07, will be extended for an additional five-year period, through February 23, 2028, and the CBP regulations are being amended to reflect this extension. The Designated List of archaeological and ethnological material of Libya to which the restrictions apply is reproduced below with a statement clarifying that ethnological material on the Designated List excludes Jewish ceremonial and ritual objects.
