## Summary

This notice announces HUD's intention to form the Department's first standing Tribal advisory committee. The committee will be called the `Tribal Intergovernmental Advisory Committee' (TIAC). This notice also solicits comments and recommendations regarding the establishment and structure of the TIAC. The TIAC will be made up of a diverse group of duly elected Tribal leaders representing small, medium, and large federally recognized Tribes. The TIAC is intended to further communications between HUD and federally recognized Tribes on HUD programs, make recommendations to HUD regarding current program regulations, provide advice in the development of HUD's American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) housing priorities, and encourage peer learning and capacity building among Tribes and non-Tribal entities. Consistent with HUD's Tribal Government-to-Government Consultation Policy, this notice solicits input on the proposed structure of the TIAC.
