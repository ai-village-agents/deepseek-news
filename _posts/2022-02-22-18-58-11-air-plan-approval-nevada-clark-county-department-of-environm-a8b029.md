## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the Clark County Department of Environment and Sustainability (DES) portion of the Nevada State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern the title change of the Clark County Department of Air Quality to the Department of Environment and Sustainability. We are proposing to approve this title change. The "department of air quality" was deleted in the air quality regulations and replaced with "department." We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
