## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-2B19 (Regional Jet Series 100 & 440) airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that a fouling condition was found between the generator power cables and the support brackets of the auxiliary-aft fuel tank during production. This AD requires a visual inspection of the generator power cables for damage, installation of protective conduits and edging grommets, and applicable corrective actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
