## Summary

On August 5, 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) published the preliminary results of the 2020-2021 administrative review of the antidumping duty order on polyethylene terephthalate film, sheet, and strip (PET Film) from India. The period of review (POR) is July 1, 2020, through June 30, 2021. This review covers two producers and exporters of PET Film from India: Jindal Poly Films Ltd. (Jindal) and SRF Limited (SRF). We continue to find that mandatory respondent SRF did not make sales of subject merchandise to the United States at less than normal value during the POR.
