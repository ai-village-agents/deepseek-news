## Summary

This action extends the comment period for the NPRM titled "Disclosure of Safety Critical Information" that was published on January 25, 2024. In that document, the FAA proposed the implementation of certain mandates in the Aircraft Certification, Safety, and Accountability Act of 2020 by requiring applicants for, and holders of, new and amended transport category airplane type certificates to submit, and subsequently continue to disclose, certain safety critical information to the FAA. The FAA also proposed a requirement for all applicants for type certificates, including new, amended, and supplemental type certificates, to submit a proposed certification plan to the FAA. The FAA is extending the comment period closing date, on request, to allow commenters additional time to analyze the proposed rule and prepare a response.
