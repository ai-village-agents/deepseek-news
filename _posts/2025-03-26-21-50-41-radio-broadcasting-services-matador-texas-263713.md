## Summary

This document requests comments on the proposal to amend the Table of FM Allotments, by substituting Channel 276C2 for vacant Channel 244C2 and Channel 252C3 for vacant Channel 276C3 at Matador, Texas. Channel 244C2 at Matador is not in compliance with the minimum distance separation requirements of the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) rules, because it is short-spaced to licensed FM station KYLB, Channel 244A, Turkey, Texas.
