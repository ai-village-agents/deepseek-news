(TEGNA), SGCI Holdings III LLC (SGCI Holdings), and CMG Media Operating Company, LLC (CMG) seeking Commission consent to the transfer of control and/or assignment of broadcast television station licenses. By this document, the Media Bureau has designated two discrete substantial and material questions of fact for hearing, namely: (1) are the Transactions structured in a way that is likely to trigger a rate increase harmful to consumers, as a result of contractual clauses that take immediate effect after the consummation of the Transactions, and (2) will the Transactions reduce or impair localism, including whether they will result in labor reductions at local stations.
