## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) and accompanying environmental assessment (EA) for a license amendment request from ProTechnics, a division of Core Laboratories LP (ProTechnics), byproduct material license no. 42-26928-01, to authorize discharge of well completion fluids containing very small amounts of short-lived radioactive tracers in offshore waters in the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Based on the analysis in the EA, the NRC staff has concluded that there would be no significant impacts on the quality of the human environment from ProTechnics' proposed license amendment request, and therefore, a FONSI is appropriate.
