## Summary

NMFS announces closures for the 2020 fishing season for the red snapper private angling component in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off Texas in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) through this temporary rule. The red snapper recreational private angling component in the Gulf EEZ off Texas closes on April 1, 2020 until 12:01 a.m., local time, on June 1, 2020, and will close again at 12:01 a.m., local time, on August 3, 2020 until 12:01 a.m., local time, on January 1, 2021. This closure is necessary to prevent the private angling component from exceeding the Texas regional management area annual catch limit (ACL) and to prevent overfishing of the Gulf red snapper resource.
