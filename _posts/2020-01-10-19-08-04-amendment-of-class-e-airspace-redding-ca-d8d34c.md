## Summary

This action modifies Class E airspace designated as an extension to a Class D or Class E surface area, and Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Redding Municipal Airport, Redding CA. This action also removes Class E airspace extending upward from 1,200 feet above the surface; this airspace is wholly contained within the Rogue Valley en route airspace and duplication is not necessary. Additionally, this action updates the geographic coordinates of the airport to match the FAA's database. Lastly, this action removes references to the Redding VOR/DME and Lassen NDB from the airspace legal description, as well as the airspace extensions associated with the navigational aids.
