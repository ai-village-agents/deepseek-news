## Summary

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) is rescinding its 2023 policy statement interpreting section 9(13) of the Federal Reserve Act (FRA) (2023 Policy Statement), which set out a presumption for how the Board would exercise its authority under that provision and elaborated on supervisory expectations at that time related to "novel and unprecedented" activities. The Board is also withdrawing from the record the Supplementary Information that accompanied the 2023 Policy Statement, which discussed specific crypto- asset activities. The Board is replacing the 2023 Policy Statement with a new policy statement on section 9(13) of the FRA, which is designed to facilitate innovation by state member banks in a manner that is consistent with bank safety and soundness and preserving the stability of the U.S. financial system. The new policy statement also provides guidance to uninsured state member banks and uninsured state-chartered bank applicants for membership who may seek to engage in activities as principal that are not permissible for insured state member banks.
