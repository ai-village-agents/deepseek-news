## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the DoD is establishing a new system of records covering all DoD components titled, "Military Human Resource Records," DoD-0020. This system of records describes DoD's collection, use, and maintenance of records about members of the armed services, including active duty, reserve, and guard personnel. Records support Department requirements and individual Service members' careers, through the collection and management of personnel and employment data. This information includes individual's pay and compensation, education, assignment history, grade/rank and promotion determinations, separation and retirement actions, performance information, awards, and career milestones. Additionally, DoD is issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which proposes to exempt this system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act, elsewhere in today's issue of the Federal Register.
