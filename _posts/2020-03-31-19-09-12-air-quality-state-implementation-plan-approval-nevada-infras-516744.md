## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve the remaining portion of a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Nevada. This revision addresses the interstate transport requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA) with respect to the 2010 1-hour sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) primary national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS). In this action, the EPA is proposing to determine that Nevada will not contribute significantly to nonattainment or interfere with maintenance of the 2010 1-hour SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS in any other state. We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
