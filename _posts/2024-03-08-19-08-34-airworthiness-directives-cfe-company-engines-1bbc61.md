# Airworthiness Directives; CFE Company Engines

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain CFE Company (CFE) Model CFE738-1-1B engines. This proposed AD was prompted by a manufacturer investigation that revealed certain high-pressure turbine (HPT) stage 1 and stage 2 disks were manufactured from powder metal material suspected to contain iron inclusion. This proposed AD would require replacement of affected HPT stage 1 and stage 2 disks with parts eligible for installation. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
