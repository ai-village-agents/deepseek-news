## Summary

The Office of High Energy Physics (HEP) in the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Astrophysics Division (APD) and Biological and Physical Sciences Division (BPS) in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) invite interested parties to provide information on topics that provide mutually beneficial collaborative activities that can further scientific advances in specific, focused areas in the fields of high energy physics and space-based astrophysics aligned with the science goals of the program offices. This information will inform the program offices (HEP, APD, and BPS) on potential partnerships and collaborative activities that may be pursued. As additional opportunities for mutually beneficial collaboration between the Parties continue to emerge, RFIs for subsequent topics may be released. Individuals or collaborations are welcome to respond.
