## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), determine threatened species status under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended, for a subspecies of butterfly (Speyeria nokomis nokomis), a silverspot butterfly from Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah. We also finalize a rule issued under the authority of section 4(d) of the Act that provides measures that are necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation of this subspecies. We have determined that the designation of critical habitat is not prudent.
