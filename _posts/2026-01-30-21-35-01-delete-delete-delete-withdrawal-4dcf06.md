# Delete, Delete, Delete; Withdrawal

**Published:** February 04, 2026 21:35 UTC

**Document Number:** 2026-01884

## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission published a direct final rule in the Federal Register on December 12, 2025, concerning the elimination of certain outdated, obsolete, and unnecessary rules. The Commission identified rules for repeal that plainly no longer serve the public interest because they are duplicative, outdated, or unnecessary. However, this document identifies certain rule deletions from the direct final rule that either drew "significant adverse" public comments or that the Commission itself has determined require additional notice and comment procedures. This document provides notice that the repeal instructions for these specific rules and rule parts are withdrawn, and the rules are retained.
