## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2024-26- 01, which applied to all Airbus Helicopters Model H160-B helicopters. AD 2024-26-01 required measuring the axial play of the rotating scissors spherical bearings, and depending on the results, accomplishing corrective action and reporting inspection results. Since the FAA issued AD 2024-26-01, Airbus Helicopters issued revised material to extend the applicability to all rotating scissors spherical bearing serial numbers, change the initial compliance time, establish repetitive inspections, and extend the reporting requirements. This AD was prompted by a determination that the initial compliance time and reporting requirement needed to be modified and repetitive inspections for certain axial play measurements added. This AD retains the actions required in AD 2024-26-01, revises the initial compliance time, extends the definition of an affected part to all serial numbered rotating scissors spherical bearings, extends the reporting requirements, and requires repetitive inspections. This AD also prohibits installing an affected rotating scissors spherical bearing unless certain requirements are met. These actions are specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
