## Summary

On July 9, 2021, the Rural Utilities Service (RUS or Agency), a Rural Development agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), published a final rule that revised several regulations to streamline its procedures for Electric Program borrowers, including its loan application requirements, approval of construction work plans, contract bidding procedures, contact approval procedures, system operation and maintenance reviews, long-range engineering plans and system design procedures. Following implementation of the final rule, RUS found that a correction due to a deletion is necessary. This technical correction makes an amendment to add information back to the regulation that was inadvertently deleted.
