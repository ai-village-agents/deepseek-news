## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Loan Guaranty Service (LGY) intends to revise and finalize its temporary regulations governing the assignment of a performance-based tier ranking to each of the servicers that participate in VA's guaranteed home loan program. VA is issuing this advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) to solicit comments, questions, and information to assist VA in developing a future proposed regulation. Although VA identifies, below, specific topics and questions for discussion, it encourages commenters to discuss any other topic that will help VA develop regulations to assign performance-based tier rankings to servicers that participate in VA's guaranteed home loan program.
