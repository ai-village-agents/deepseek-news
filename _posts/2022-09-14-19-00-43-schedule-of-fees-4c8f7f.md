# Schedule of Fees

**Published:** February 05, 2026 19:00 UTC

**Document Number:** 2022-19560

## Summary

This document proposes fees for Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 and future FYs relating to the registration of importers and the importation of motor vehicles not certified as conforming to the Federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSS). In addition to proposing new fee amounts, this document also proposes three modifications to existing provisions of part 594. The first seeks to modify our assessment of the administrative costs of registered importer (RI) renewals by authorizing collection of inspection costs as part of the inspected entity's monthly invoice instead of adding those costs to its annual renewal fee. The second proposal would seek to adjust how a vehicle inspection fee is determined in cases where an RI requests inspection of a vehicle subject to an eligibility petition. Finally, the third proposal would clarify circumstances in which NHTSA (the Agency) would charge additional fees for submission of conformity packages with errors or omissions. The fees in this update are mandated by statute and are necessary to maintain the RI program.
