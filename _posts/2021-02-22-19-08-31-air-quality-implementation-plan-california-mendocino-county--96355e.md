## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve two rule revisions to the Mendocino County Air Quality Managment District (MCAQMD or "District") portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern the District's prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) permitting program for new and modified stationary sources of air pollution. We are proposing action on these local rules pursuant to requirements under Part C of Title I of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (CAA or the "Act"). We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
