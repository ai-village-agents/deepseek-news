## Summary

The Coast Guard announces the availability of the final policy letter that describes type-approval testing methods, and the acceptance process for such methods, for ballast water management systems (BWMS) that render organisms nonviable in ballast water. At this time, the Coast Guard does not accept any type-approval testing methods for ballast water management systems that render organisms in ballast water nonviable (meaning "permanently incapable of reproduction"). In consideration of public comments on the draft policy letter, this final policy letter establishes the mechanism for reviewing and integrating viability testing methods into the existing Coast Guard type-approval testing program. The Coast Guard invites submissions of viability testing methods in accordance with the policy letter at any time following publication. The Coast Guard will review any provided information responsive to the policy letter and enclosure. This final policy letter is subject to revision, in coordination with the Environmental Protection Agency, contingent on any Coast Guard determination that a viability testing method is acceptable.
