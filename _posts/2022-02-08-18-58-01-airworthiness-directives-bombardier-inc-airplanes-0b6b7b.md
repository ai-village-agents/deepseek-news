## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-1A11 (600), CL-600-2A12 (601), and CL-600-2B16 (601-3A, 601-3R, and 604 Variants) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of smoke in the aft cabin during a maintenance activity, which an investigation determined was caused by a faulty drain line ribbon heater. This proposed AD would require a general visual inspection of all affected potable water-line ribbon heater installations and corrective actions and other specified actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
