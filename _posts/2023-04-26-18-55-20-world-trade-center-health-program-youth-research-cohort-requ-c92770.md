## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), in the Department of Health and Human Services, announces an opportunity for the public to provide information about approaches to establishing a new World Trade Center (WTC) Health Program research cohort of persons who were exposed to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and were aged 21 years or younger at the time of their exposure. This research cohort will be designed to allow the WTC Health Program to conduct future research studies on the health and educational impacts in the population of persons aged 21 years or younger at the time of their exposures to airborne toxins, or any other hazard or adverse condition, resulting from the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Once established, this new WTC Health Program "youth cohort" would serve as the basis for future WTC Health Program research into the health and educational impacts of this potentially vulnerable group, hereafter referred to as "WTC Youth." Information is requested on specific adverse health, social, and educational effects that are of interest for future research; desired characteristics of the proposed cohort and associated control groups (e.g., size and demographics), and methods for identifying, recruiting, and obtaining informed consent from members; as well as data collection, storage, and management methods necessary for future research investigations.
