## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-02- 03, which applied to all The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. AD 2019-02-03 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2019-02-03 and requires incorporation of an airworthiness limitation that applies only to certain airplanes. This AD also requires replacing or modifying certain engine fire control panels, which terminates the revised airworthiness limitation added in this final rule when a certain condition is met. Since the FAA issued AD 2019-02-03, the manufacturer has developed a new fire handle design that will eliminate the need for the airworthiness limitations required by AD 2019-02-03. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
