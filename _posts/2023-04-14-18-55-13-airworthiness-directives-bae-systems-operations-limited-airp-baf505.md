# Airworthiness Directives; BAE Systems (Operations) Limited Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all BAE Systems (Operations) Limited Model 4101 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by in-service cracking of the passenger door edge member, seal carrier, and inner skin, adjacent to the roller guide bracket. This proposed AD would require a one-time inspection of the external visible surface of the inner skin, door edge member, and seal carrier adjacent to the roller bracket attachment brackets; and the inner skin, door edge member, and seal carrier at the roller bracket attachment bore, and repair if necessary. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
