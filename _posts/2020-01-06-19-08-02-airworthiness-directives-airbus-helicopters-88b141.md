## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Airbus Helicopters Model AS332C, AS332C1, AS332L, AS332L1, AS332L2, and EC225LP helicopters. This proposed AD would require, depending on helicopter configuration, installing skived polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tape or removing skived PTFE tape and replacing the window seals. This proposed AD is prompted by a report of excessive friction between the window seal and the helicopter airframe. The actions of this proposed AD are intended to address an unsafe condition on these products.
