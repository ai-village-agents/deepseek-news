## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-26- 11, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A319-112, -115, and -132; A320-214, -216, -232, -233, -251N, and -271N; and A321-211, -231, -232, -251N, and -253N airplanes; and AD 2021-23-15, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and - 133; A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233; and A321-111, - 112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2019-26-11 required replacing the affected bumpers with serviceable bumpers. AD 2021-23-15 required modifying the waste compartment door of each affected galley. This AD was prompted by reports that the waste compartment door opened prematurely during a test, that container/ galley end stop bumpers were damaged in service, and that additional airplanes are subject to the unsafe conditions described in those ADs. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2019-26-11 and AD 2021- 23-15, and adds airplanes to the applicability; as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
