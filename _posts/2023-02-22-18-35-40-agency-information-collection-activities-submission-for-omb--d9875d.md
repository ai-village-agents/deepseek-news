The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will submit the information collection abstracted below to the Office of Management and Budget for review and clearance in accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The submission seeks comments concerning the removal of use of the FEMA Form FF-USFA-FY-21-108 (formerly 119-17-2), Request for Use of National Emergency Training Center Facilities, due to its antiquated information collection method and requirement. There is no longer a need to formally require the use of this form in order for a requestor to receive support for special groups using the National Emergency Training Center.
