The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA or Agency) is proposing a Clean Water Act (CWA) rule to extend deadlines, promulgated in the 2024 "Supplemental Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source Category" (2024 rule), update the transfer provisions to allow facilities to switch between compliance alternatives, and create authority for an alternative applicability dates and paperwork submission dates, based on site-specific factors.
