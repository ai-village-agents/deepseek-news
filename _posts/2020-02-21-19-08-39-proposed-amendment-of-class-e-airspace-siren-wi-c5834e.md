## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Burnett County Airport, Siren, WI. The FAA is proposing these actions as the result of an airspace review caused by the decommissioning of the Siren VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) navigation aid, which provided navigation information for the instrument procedures at this airport, as part of the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program. The geographic coordinates of the airport would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database. Airspace redesign is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at this airport.
