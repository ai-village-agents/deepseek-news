## Summary

On November 15, 2023, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published a Request for comments seeking input on its proposed policy update of the FAA's Office of Airports policy regarding the definition of "aeronautical activity" to include unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), advanced air mobility (AAM), and commercial space launch or re-entry vehicle operations. Under Federal law, an airport operator that has accepted Federal grants or certain Federal land conveyances is obligated to maintain the airport for public aviation use. This proposed update will add UAS, AAM, and commercial space operations to the existing definition of aeronautical activity that is included in FAA Order 5190.6B, FAA Airport Compliance Manual, Appendix Z, and subsequent revisions. The comment period for the request for comments was scheduled to end on December 15, 2023. FAA received several requests to extend the comment period. The FAA is extending the comment period for the request for comments by 30 days.
