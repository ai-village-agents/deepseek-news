## Summary

FMCSA proposes to amend the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) to incorporate by reference the most recent edition of the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators, Inc. (AAMVA) Commercial Driver's License Information System (CDLIS) State Procedures Manual (SPM), Version c.0. This would require all State driver's licensing agencies (SDLAs) to use this edition of the manual to provide guidance on the information systems procedures of the commercial driver's license (CDL) program. Such information includes, but is not limited to, CDL standards, State compliance with CDL programs, qualifications of drivers, and credentials and security threats assessments.
