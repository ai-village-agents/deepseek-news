## Summary

This interim rule with request for comment establishes technical guidelines for quantifying, reporting, and verifying the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with agricultural production of biofuel feedstock commodity crops grown in the United States in the context of environmental service markets. Specifically, the rule establishes guidelines for the reporting and verification of practices and technologies used in the production of certain commodity crops that result in lower greenhouse gas emissions or increases in carbon storage. These practices are referred to in the context of this rule as climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices. The guidelines established through this rule articulate an approach for farm producers to quantify the GHG emissions associated with crops produced using one or more CSA practices. The guidelines also articulate a framework for how information regarding GHG emissions, resulting from the production of biofuel feedstock commodity crops, could be reported and tracked throughout the supply chain.
