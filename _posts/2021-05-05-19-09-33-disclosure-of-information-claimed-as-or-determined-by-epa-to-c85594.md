## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA" or "Agency") is providing notice of disclosure to all obligated parties under the Renewable Fuel Standard ("RFS") program that have petitioned for a small refinery exemption and to all parties whose RFS information otherwise resides in EPA's Moderated Transaction System ("EMTS"). In response to a request by the U.S. Government Accountability Office ("GAO"), EPA will disclose information to GAO which has been submitted to the Agency that is claimed to be, or has been determined to be, confidential business information (collectively "CBI"). The information to be disclosed includes all documents, information, and data related to all small refinery exemption petitions received by EPA from the start of the RFS program through the present. These records include, but are not limited to: (a) All materials submitted by the small refineries as part of its petition; (b) any documentation sent by the Department of Energy ("DOE") to EPA stating DOE's findings and score(s) associated with the petition(s) and any EPA responses thereto; (c) any EPA record addressing the subject of the exemption petition(s), including any analysis that EPA conducted in addition to DOE's findings; and (d) EPA's final exemption decision sent to the refinery. EPA also intends to disclose to GAO all RFS related transaction-level data contained in EMTS, including Renewable Identification Number ("RIN") transactions under the RFS. This information is being produced to GAO pursuant to EPA's regulations pertaining to disclosure.
