## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission's Media Bureau substitutes channel * 24 for channel * 4 at Jacksonville, Oregon in the Table of TV Allotments (table) in response to a Petition for Rulemaking filed by theDove Media, Inc. (TDM or Petitioner), the permittee of a new NCE television station to serve Jacksonville, Oregon (Jacksonville), with Facility ID No. 791569 (Station). The staff engineering analysis finds that the proposal is in compliance with the Commission's principal community coverage and technical requirements. The substitution of channel * 24 for channel * 4 in the table will allow TDM to construct its new facility on a UHF channel and avoid the known viewer reception issues on its currently authorized VHF channel.
