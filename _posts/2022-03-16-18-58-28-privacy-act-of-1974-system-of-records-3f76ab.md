## Summary

To fulfill its conflict resolution and training mission, Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) uses Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft Outlook, and a case records management system new to FMCS to enable mediators and managers to manage cases, manage reporting requirements, provide data for research and training, store recorded trainings and meetings, and collect information on Agency operations. The Agency's internal drives, SharePoint, Outlook, Cloud- based services such as Zoom.gov and Microsoft Teams, and a case records management system are used to store electronic case tracking information, electronic case files (including mediation agreements), and recorded meetings and trainings, permitting the accurate and timely collection, retrieval, and retention of information maintained by offices of the Agency. Inter-Agency Agreements (IAA), agreements for reimbursable services, and requests for mediation and training are also stored in these locations. IAAs and agreements for reimbursable services allow FMCS to provide requested services, such as training and labor dispute resolution, to other federal agencies. The notice amendment includes administrative updates to refine details published under summary, dates, supplementary information, system name, system location, authority for maintenance of the system, purpose of the system, categories of individuals covered by the system, categories of records in the system, record source categories, routine uses, policies and practices for storage of records, policies and practices for retrieval of records, policies and practices for retention and disposal of records, administrative safeguards, record access procedures, and contesting records procedures. These sections are amended to refine previously published information about the system of records. The addresses, for further information contact, security classification, system location, system manager, notification procedures, exemptions promulgated, and history remain unchanged. This amended SORN deletes and supersedes the SORN published in the Federal Register on September 21, 2021.
