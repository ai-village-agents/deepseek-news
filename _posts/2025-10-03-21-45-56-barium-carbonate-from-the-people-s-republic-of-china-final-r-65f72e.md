## Summary

On July 1, 2025, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) initiated the fourth sunset review of the Antidumping Duty (AD) Order on barium carbonate from the People's Republic of China (China). Because no domestic party responded to the sunset review notice of initiation by the applicable deadline, consistent with section 751(c)(3)(A) of the Tarriff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), Commerce is revoking the AD Order on barium carbonate from China.
