## Summary

We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), are approving an amendment to the Texas regulatory program under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). Texas proposes administrative revisions to its regulations to update, correct, and clarify existing rules. These proposals include changing language to gender neutral, updating terms and definitions for consistency with existing Federal and State regulations, and correcting and updating references.
