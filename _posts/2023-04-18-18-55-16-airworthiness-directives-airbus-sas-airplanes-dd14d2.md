## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-16-18, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A330-200 Freighter, A330-200, A330-300, A330-800, A330-900, A340-200, A340-300, A340-500, and A340-600 series airplanes. AD 2021-16-18 requires repetitive inspections of certain fuel pumps for cavitation erosion, replacement if necessary, revision of the existing operator's minimum equipment list (MEL), and accomplishment of certain maintenance actions related to defueling and ground fuel transfer operations. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-16-18, new, more erosion resistant pumps were developed and the FAA determined that affected fuel pumps must be replaced with new, more erosion resistant pumps. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2021-16-18 and would require replacement of affected parts, which would terminate the repetitive inspections, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of certain affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
