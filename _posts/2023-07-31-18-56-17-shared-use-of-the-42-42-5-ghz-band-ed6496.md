## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission or FCC) seeks comment on how innovative, non-exclusive spectrum access models might be deployed in the 42 GHz band (42-42.5 GHz) to provide increased access to high-band spectrum, particularly by smaller wireless service providers, and to support efficient, intensive use of the band. The Commission also seeks comment on how potential sharing and licensing regimes might lower barriers to entry for smaller or emerging wireless service providers, encourage competition, and prevent spectrum warehousing.
