# Airworthiness Directives; ATR-GIE Avions de Transport Régional Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA is revising an earlier proposal to supersede Airworthiness Directives (AD) 2000-23-04 R1 and AD 2018-20-14, which apply to certain ATR-GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42-500 airplanes. This action revises the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) by including new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since this action would impose an additional burden over those in the NPRM, the FAA is reopening the comment period to allow the public the chance to comment on these changes.
