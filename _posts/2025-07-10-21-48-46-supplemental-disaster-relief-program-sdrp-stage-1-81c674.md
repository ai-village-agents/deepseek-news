## Summary

The Farm Service Agency (FSA) is issuing this final rule announcing SDRP, which provides assistance to eligible producers for losses to crops, trees, bushes, and vines due to wildfires, hurricanes, floods, derechos, excessive heat, tornadoes, winter storms, freeze (including a polar vortex), smoke exposure, excessive moisture, qualifying drought, and related conditions occurring in calendar years 2023 and 2024. SDRP assistance will be provided in two stages, referred to as Stage 1 and Stage 2. This document provides the eligibility requirements, application process, and payment calculations for SDRP Stage 1 only, which will provide payments for eligible crop, tree, and vine losses calculated using data already on file with USDA from previously issued Federal crop insurance indemnities and Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) payments. FSA anticipates announcing SDRP Stage 2 in a later rule.
