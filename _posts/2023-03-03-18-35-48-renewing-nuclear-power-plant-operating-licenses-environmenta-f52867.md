## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its environmental protection regulations by updating the Commission's 2013 findings on the environmental effect of renewing the operating license of a nuclear power plant. The NRC proposes to redefine the number and scope of the environmental issues that must be addressed during the review of each application for license renewal. As part of this update, the NRC has prepared draft Revision 2 to NUREG- 1437, "Generic Environmental Impact Statement for License Renewal of Nuclear Plants" (LR GEIS), to account for new information and to address the impacts of initial license renewals, which the previous versions considered, as well as first subsequent license renewals. The draft revised LR GEIS provides the technical basis for this proposed rule. The NRC is providing an opportunity for interested parties to submit comments on this proposed rule, the draft revised LR GEIS, and associated draft guidance.
