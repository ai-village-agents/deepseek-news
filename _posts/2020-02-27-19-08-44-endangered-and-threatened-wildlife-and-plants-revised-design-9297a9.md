## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), revise the proposed critical habitat for the western distinct population segment of the yellow-billed cuckoo (western yellow-billed cuckoo) (Coccyzus americanus) under the Endangered Species Act. In total, approximately 493,665 acres (199,779 hectares) are now being proposed for designation as critical habitat in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Texas, and Utah. If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would extend the Act's protections to this species' critical habitat.
