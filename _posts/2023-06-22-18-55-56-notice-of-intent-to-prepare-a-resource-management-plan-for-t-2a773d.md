## Summary

In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (NEPA), and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, as amended, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) New Mexico State Director intends to develop a Resource Management Plan (RMP) with an associated Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument (Monument) and by this notice is announcing the beginning of the scoping period to solicit public comments and identify issues, is providing the planning criteria for public review, and is issuing a call for nominations for areas of critical environmental concern (ACECs). The Mimbres RMP currently provides for BLM management in this new planning area. The RMP revision would replace the existing Mimbres RMP within the now-established National Monument.
