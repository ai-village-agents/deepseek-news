## Summary

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing final regulations to allow certain current and former employees of a land management agency to compete for a permanent position at such agency, when the agency is accepting applications from individuals within the agency's workforce under promotion and internal placement (i.e., merit promotion) procedures; or at any hiring agency when the agency is accepting applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures. The intended effect of this hiring authority is to provide a pathway for current and former land management employees currently serving (or served) under time-limited appointments, who have not received a permanent appointment in the competitive service, to compete for vacant permanent Federal positions in the competitive service under merit promotion procedures.
