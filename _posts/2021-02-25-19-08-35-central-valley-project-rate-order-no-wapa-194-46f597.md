## Summary

This Rate Order confirms, approves, and places into effect Provisional Formula Rates for the Central Valley Project's (CVP) Energy Imbalance Market (EIM) Services, Sale of Surplus Products (SSP), and revisions to the existing Energy Imbalance (EI) and Generator Imbalance (GI) formula rates (collectively, Provisional Formula Rates). The Provisional Formula Rates are associated with three events: Participation in the California Independent System Operator's (CAISO) EIM; alignment of CVP's SSP with other Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) regions; and revision of existing EI and GI rate schedules.
