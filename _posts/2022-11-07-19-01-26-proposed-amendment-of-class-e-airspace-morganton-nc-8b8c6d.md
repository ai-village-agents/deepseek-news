## Summary

This action proposes to amend Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface for Foothills Regional Airport, Morganton, NC, by updating the airport's name and geographic coordinates. Additionally, the geographic coordinates of Fiddlers NDB would be updated. Also, Grace Hospital would be removed from the descriptor, as all instrument approaches into the hospital have been canceled. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.
