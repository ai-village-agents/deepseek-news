## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of potassium polyaspartate (CASRN 64723-18- 8) when used as an inert ingredient (complexing agent), at a maximum of 10% in formulation, pre-harvest. Rosen's Inc., submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of potassium polyaspartate, when used in accordance with the terms of the exemptions.
