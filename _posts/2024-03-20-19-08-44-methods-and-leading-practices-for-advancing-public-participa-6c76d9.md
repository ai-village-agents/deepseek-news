## Summary

The Federal Government is committed to making it easier for the American people to engage with their Government, and to harnessing their knowledge, needs, and lived experiences to improve how Government works for them and with them. Federal laws and Executive directives require agencies to frequently consult with the public to inform regulations, policies, program and service design, and other actions. However, these consultation efforts may be perceived as inaccessible, convoluted, or disconnected from the interests and priorities of impacted stakeholders. According to the 2023 Partnership for Public Service (PPS) survey on trust in government, only about 1 in 5 Americans believe that the Federal Government "listens to the public" or "is transparent." The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in partnership with Federal agencies and the public, is working to develop a government- wide framework, common guidelines, and leading practices for public participation and community engagement (PPCE or "participation and engagement"). This framework will enable agencies to more frequently, effectively, broadly, and meaningfully involve the public, including underserved communities, in government decision-making. Through this Request for Information (RFI), OMB seeks input on the experiences of individuals and organizations, including from underserved communities, with informing Federal Government decision- making and participating in engagement activities with government agencies; examples of leading practices in this space; and other recommendations on available methods, approaches, and tools that could assist in the effort to develop and implement a Federal framework for participation and engagement. OMB welcomes input from a wide and diverse array of stakeholders in the public, private, advocacy, not- for-profit, and philanthropic sectors, including State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments. OMB will review and consider the usability and applicability of responses to this RFI as OMB develops a Federal framework for PPCE and supports agencies in their work to ensure that their policies and actions are responsive to all Americans.
