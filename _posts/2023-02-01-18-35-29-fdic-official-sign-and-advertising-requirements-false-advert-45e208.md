## Summary

On December 21, 2022, the FDIC published in the Federal Register a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) seeking comment on proposed changes to the FDIC's regulations relating to the FDIC's official sign, the FDIC's official advertising statement, and misrepresentations of deposit insurance coverage. The NPR provided for a 60-day comment period, which would have closed on February 21, 2023. The FDIC is extending the comment period until April 7, 2023, to allow interested parties additional time to analyze the proposal and prepare comments.
