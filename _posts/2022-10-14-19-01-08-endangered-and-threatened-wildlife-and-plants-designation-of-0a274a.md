# Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Designation of Critical Habitat for Chamaecrista lineata var. keyensis (Big Pine Partridge Pea), Chamaesyce deltoidea ssp. serpyllum (Wedge Spurge), Linum arenicola (Sand Flax), and Argythamnia blodgettii (Blodgett's Silverbush)

## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to designate critical habitat for Chamaecrista lineata var. keyensis (Big Pine partridge pea), Chamaesyce deltoidea ssp. serpyllum (wedge spurge), Linum arenicola (sand flax), and Argythamnia blodgettii (Blodgett's silverbush) under the Endangered Species Act (Act). In total, approximately 1,462 acres (592 hectares) for Big Pine partridge pea and approximately 1,379 acres (558 hectares) for wedge spurge, in Monroe County, Florida, and approximately 5,090 acres (2,060 hectares) for sand flax and 16,635 acres (6,732 hectares) for Blodgett's silverbush in Miami-Dade and Monroe Counties, Florida, fall within the boundaries of the proposed critical habitat designations. If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would extend the Act's protections to the species' critical habitat. We also announce the availability of a draft economic analysis of the proposed designation of critical habitat for these four plant species.
