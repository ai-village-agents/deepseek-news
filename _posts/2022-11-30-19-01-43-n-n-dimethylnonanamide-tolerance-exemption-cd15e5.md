## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of N,N-dimethylnonanamide (CAS Reg. No. 6225-08-7) when used as an inert ingredient (solvent, co-solvent, and adjuvant) not to exceed 20% by weight in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops and raw agricultural commodities pre- and post- harvest, and applied to animals. Spring Trading Company, on behalf of Clariant Corporation, submitted a petition (IN-11126) to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of N,N-dimethylnonanamide, when used in accordance with the terms of these exemptions.
