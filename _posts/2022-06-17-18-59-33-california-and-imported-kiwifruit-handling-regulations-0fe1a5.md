## Summary

This proposed rule would implement a recommendation from the Kiwifruit Administrative Committee (Committee) to modify the handling regulations prescribed under the Federal marketing order for kiwifruit grown in California. This action would revise the size and uniformity requirements for all varieties of Actinidia chinensis species kiwifruit, which is commonly known as golden kiwifruit, regulated under the marketing order. A corresponding change would be made to the kiwifruit import regulation as required under section 8e of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937.
