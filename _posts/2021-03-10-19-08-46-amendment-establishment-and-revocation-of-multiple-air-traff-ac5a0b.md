## Summary

This action amends Jet Route J-134, Area Navigation (RNAV) route Q-67, and VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-45 and V-119; establishes RNAV route Q-176; and removes Jet Route J-91 and VOR Federal airway V-174 in the vicinity of Henderson, WV. The Air Traffic Service (ATS) route modifications are necessary due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Henderson, WV, VOR/ Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) navigation aid (NAVAID). The Henderson VORTAC provides navigation guidance for portions of the affected air traffic service (ATS) routes and the VOR portion is being decommissioned as part of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
