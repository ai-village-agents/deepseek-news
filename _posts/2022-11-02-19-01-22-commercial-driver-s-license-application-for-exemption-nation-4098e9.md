## Summary

FMCSA corrects the October 27, 2022, notice of final disposition in which the Agency announced its decision to grant the exemption requested by the National School Transportation Association (NSTA). Although the exemption expiration date is correctly stated in the DATES section of the notice, Section VII of the notice incorrectly identifies the expiration date. Today's correction notice is being published to remedy that error.
