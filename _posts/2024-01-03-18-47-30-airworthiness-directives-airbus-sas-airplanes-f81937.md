## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-07- 15, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A318, A319, A320, and A321 series airplanes. AD 2022-07-15 required replacing affected braking and steering control units (BSCUs) and revising the operator's existing FAA-approved minimum equipment list (MEL). This AD was prompted by a determination that a type 1 relay combined with an affected BSCU would induce BSCU freezing. This AD removes certain airplanes from the applicability, retains the requirements of AD 2022-07-15, requires an inspection for the relay type installed and replacement of type 1 relays with type 2 relays, limits the installation of affected BSCUs on certain airplanes and prohibits the installation of affected BSCUs for certain other airplanes as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
