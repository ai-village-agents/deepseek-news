## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Transportation (DOT) proposes to rename, update, and reissue an existing system of records notice currently titled DOT Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) system of records DOT/FAA 811, "Employee Health Record System." This system of records notice (hereafter referred to as "Notice") previously covered FAA employees only. FAA employee occupational health care records and Health Awareness Program records are currently covered under the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)/ Government (GOVT)--10 Employee Medical File System Records SORN (80 FR 74815--November 30, 2015). The updated Notice covers the FAA's collection, use, and maintenance of non-occupational health records on federal employees, as well as FAA contractors and members of the public, such as students, interns and training and research participants, who receive emergency medical services at either the Civil Aerospace Medical Institute (CAMI) Occupational Health Clinic located at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC) in Oklahoma City, OK, or the FAA Headquarters (HQ) Health Unit located in the HQ building in Washington, DC. Additionally, it covers FAA's collection of participation status (i.e., eligible, ineligible) on members of the public who engage in research and training programs at the agency. Any medical records collected in the course of these research or training programs is outside the scope of this Notice. The data collected in the system is a combination of health information and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) which is used to provide proper medical care and case management.
