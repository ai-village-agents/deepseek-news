## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Mooney International Corporation (Mooney) Model M20V airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of short circuit and arcing of the alternator main power cable in the engine compartment. This condition, if unaddressed, could result in a fire hazard, loss of engine thrust control, and reduced control of the airplane. This proposed AD would require inspecting the alternator main power cable and the exhaust crossover tube for damage, replacing damaged parts as necessary, and installing an additional alternator cable clamp. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
