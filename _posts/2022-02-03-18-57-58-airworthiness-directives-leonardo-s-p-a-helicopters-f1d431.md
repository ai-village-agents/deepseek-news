## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-17-18, which applies to all Leonardo S.p.a. Model A109C, A109K2, A109E, A109S, and AW109SP helicopters. AD 2021-17-18 requires an inspection of certain tail rotor (TR) sleeve assemblies for discrepancies, an inspection of certain TR shaft assemblies for discrepancies, a repetitive measurement of the position of the bushing of the TR sleeve assembly in relation to the pitch change slider assembly, and corrective actions if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-17-18, the FAA has determined that it is necessary to require repetitive inspections of certain TR sleeve assemblies and corrective actions. This proposed AD would retain the requirements of AD 2021-17- 18; and would also require repetitive inspections of the TR sleeve assemblies, and corrective actions if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
