NAVAL STATION NEWPORT R.I. --- In a strategic move to enhance the core competencies of the Navy’s Surface Warfare Officers, Surface Warfare Schools Command (SWSC) ushered in a new era of maritime training with the establishment of the Mariner Skills Training Centers (MSTCs). The MSTCs, one located in San Diego, California (MSTCPAC) and the other in Norfolk, Virginia (MSTCLANT), are state-of-the-art facilities and represent a significant investment in the professional development of our Sailors. The creation of these centers was a direct result of the Vice Chief of Naval Operations' Surface Force Comprehensive Review, which identified critical gaps in seamanship and navigation skills following the fatal collisions involving the USS Fitzgerald and USS John S. McCain in 2017.
