## Summary

This action proposes to amend Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Tahlequah Municipal Airport in Tahlequah, OK. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of an airspace review caused by the decommissioning of the Tahlequah non- directional radio beacon (NDB). The geographic coordinates for the airport in the associated airspace would be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database. Airspace redesign is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at this airport.
