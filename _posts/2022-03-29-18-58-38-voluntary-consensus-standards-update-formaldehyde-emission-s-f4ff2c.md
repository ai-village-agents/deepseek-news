## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to update the incorporation by reference of several voluntary consensus standards in the Agency's formaldehyde standards for composite wood products regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) that have since been updated, superseded, or withdrawn by the issuing organizations. In addition, EPA is proposing to address remote inspections for third-party certifiers (TPCs) required to conduct on- site inspections in the event of unsafe conditions such as the on-going COVID-19 pandemic or other unsafe conditions such as natural disasters, outbreaks, political unrest, and epidemics. Finally, EPA is proposing certain technical corrections and conforming changes including updating standards within the definitions section, clarifying language as it relates to production, and creating greater flexibilities for the third-party certification process.
