## Summary

FinCEN is issuing this advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) to solicit public comment on questions pertinent to the implementation of the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA), enacted into law as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (NDAA). This ANPRM seeks initial public input on procedures and standards for reporting companies to submit information to FinCEN about their beneficial owners (the individual natural persons who ultimately own or control the reporting companies) as required by the CTA. This ANPRM also seeks initial public input on FinCEN's implementation of the related provisions of the CTA that govern FinCEN's maintenance and disclosure of beneficial ownership information subject to appropriate protocols.
