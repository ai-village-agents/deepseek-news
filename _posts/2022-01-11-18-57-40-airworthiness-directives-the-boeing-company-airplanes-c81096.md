## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-03- 26, which applied to certain The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, - 700C, -800, -900, and -900ER series airplanes. AD 2019-03-26 required modifying the passenger service units (PSUs) and life vest panels by replacing the existing inboard lanyard and installing two new lanyards on the outboard edge of the PSUs and life vest panels; measuring the distance between the hooks of the torsion spring of the lanyard assembly; replacing discrepant lanyard assemblies; and re-identifying serviceable lanyard assemblies. This AD was prompted by a determination that certain airplanes are listed in the wrong configuration and certain PSUs have not been correctly re-identified. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2019-03-26, and, for certain airplanes, requires an inspection to determine if the re-identified PSU part number is correct, and further re-identification if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
