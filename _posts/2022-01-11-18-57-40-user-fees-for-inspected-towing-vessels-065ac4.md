# User Fees for Inspected Towing Vessels

## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to update its user fees for seagoing towing vessels that are 300 gross tons or more and to revise user fees for other inspected towing vessels. The Coast Guard is proposing these updates because we are required to establish and maintain a fair fee for our vessel inspection services and to separate the fees for inspection options that involve third-party auditors and surveyors from inspection options that do not involve third parties. Under this proposed rule, vessels using the Alternate Compliance Program, Streamlined Inspection Program, or the Towing Safety Management System options would pay a lower fee than vessels that use the traditional Coast Guard inspection option.
