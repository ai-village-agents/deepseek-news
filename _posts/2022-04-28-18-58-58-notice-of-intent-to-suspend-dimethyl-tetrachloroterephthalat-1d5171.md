## Summary

This notice, pursuant the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), publishes a Notice of Intent to Suspend a pesticide registration issued by EPA containing dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate (DCPA). The Notice of Intent to Suspend was issued following the Agency's January 21, 2013, issuance of a Data Call-In Notice (DCI), which required the registrant of the affected pesticide product containing DCPA to take appropriate steps to secure certain data. Following the registrant's failure to submit these data or to take other appropriate steps to secure the required data, the agency is unable to fully evaluate the risks associated with DCPA. Data for DCPA were determined to be required to maintain the existing registration of the affected product. In particular, due to the lack of complete data examining thyroid toxicity of DCPA, the Agency is not able to complete a scientifically robust and defensible human health risk assessment. Preliminary data evaluated by EPA provides evidence that, in animal studies, the fetus is potentially more sensitive to DCPA's effect on thyroid function compared to the mother. Given this potential fetal sensitivity, EPA has concerns for exposures to pregnant females and effects on the developing fetus. Based on EPA's review of the preliminary data, applying a standard uncertainty factor (typically a ten-fold factor) to account for these missing data may not be adequate to account for these effects. The failure of the registrant to comply with the thyroid toxicity and other data requirements of the DCPA DCI is a basis for suspension of the affected registration under FIFRA.
