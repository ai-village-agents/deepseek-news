## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing an exemption from the regulation that would otherwise require the application for subsequent renewal of Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-19 and DPR-25 for Dresden Nuclear Power Station, Unit Nos. 2 and 3, respectively, to be referred to the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) for a review and report, with any report being made part of the record of the application and made available to the public, except to the extent that security classification prevents disclosure. The NRC finds that the required criteria are met due to the special circumstance presented by Executive Order (E.O.) 14300, "Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission," section 4(b) (stating that "[r]eview by ACRS of permitting and licensing issues shall focus on issues that are truly novel or noteworthy").
