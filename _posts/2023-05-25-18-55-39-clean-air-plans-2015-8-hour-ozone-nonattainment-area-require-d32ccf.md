## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a revision to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) concerning the provisions for Clean Fuels for Fleets (CFF) for the 2015 ozone national ambient air quality standards ("2015 ozone NAAQS") in the Riverside County (Coachella Valley), Sacramento Metro, San Joaquin Valley, Los Angeles--South Coast Air Basin (South Coast), Ventura County, and Los Angeles--San Bernardino Counties (West Mojave Desert) nonattainment areas (NAAs). The SIP revision includes the "California Clean Fuels for Fleets Certification for the 70 ppb Ozone Standard" ("Clean Fuels for Fleets Certification"), a multi-district certification that California's Low-Emission Vehicle (LEV) program achieved emissions reductions at least equivalent to the reductions that would be achieved by the EPA's Clean Fuels for Fleets Program, submitted on February 3, 2022. We are approving the revision under the Clean Air Act (CAA or "the Act"), which establishes clean fuels for fleets requirements for "Serious," "Severe," and "Extreme" ozone NAAs.
