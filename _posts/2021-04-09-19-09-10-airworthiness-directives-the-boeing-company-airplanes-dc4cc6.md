# Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 757-200, -200PF, -200CB, and -300 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by crack indications found in the lower aft wing skin bolt holes where the flap tracks attach to the track support fitting. This proposed AD would require repetitive high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections for cracking of the lower aft wing skin aft edge at certain flap tracks, and repair if necessary. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
