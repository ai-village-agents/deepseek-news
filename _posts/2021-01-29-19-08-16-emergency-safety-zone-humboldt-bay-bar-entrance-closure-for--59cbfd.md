## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone in the navigable waters of the Humboldt Bay Bar Channel and the Humboldt Bay Entrance Channel, of Eureka, CA. This emergency safety zone is in support of the safe navigation of piloted vessels transiting and is needed to protect life, vessels, and the maritime environment from potential hazards posed by the wreckage of a fishing vessel that sank near the Channel on January 24, 2021. The location of the wreckage is currently unknown. Due to heavy weather conditions, a proper survey of the wreckage cannot be immediately completed. Unauthorized piloted vessels are prohibited from entering into, transiting through, or remaining in the safety zone without permission from the Captain of the Port San Francisco or a designated representative.
