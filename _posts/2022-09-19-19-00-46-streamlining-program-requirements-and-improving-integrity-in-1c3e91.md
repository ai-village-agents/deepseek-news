## Summary

This rulemaking amends the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) regulations to strengthen program integrity by clarifying, simplifying, and streamlining program administration to facilitate compliance with program requirements. Through this final rule, USDA is codifying changes to the regulations that will streamline requirements among Child Nutrition Programs, simplify the application process, enhance monitoring requirements, offer more clarity on existing requirements, and provide more discretion at the State agency level to manage program operations.
