## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-20- 06, which applied to certain Bell Helicopter Textron Canada Limited (now Bell Textron Canada Limited) Model 429 helicopters. AD 2020-20-06 required repetitive inspections of certain cyclic and collective assembly bearings. This AD was prompted by new bellcrank assemblies, which have been upgraded with corrosion resistant steel bearings. This AD retains certain requirements of AD 2020-20-06, and depending on the inspection results, requires removing certain parts from service and installing the upgraded cyclic and collective bellcrank assemblies. This AD also requires installing the upgraded collective and cyclic bellcrank assemblies on certain helicopters if not already installed, and prohibits installing certain bellcrank assemblies. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
