## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the State of Missouri. This final action will amend the SIP to approve revision submitted by the State of Missouri on March 7, 2019, to a State regulation for the Restriction of Particulate Matter to the Ambient Air Beyond the Premises of Origin. These revisions include adding definitions that are specific to the rule, restructures the rule into the standard rule organization format, and removes unnecessary words. The revisions are administrative in nature and do not impact the stringency of the SIP or air quality. The EPA's approval of this rule revision is in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
