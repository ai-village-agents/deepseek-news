## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) invites nominations from a diverse range of qualified candidates to serve on a new subcommittee of the Farm, Ranch, and Rural Communities Advisory Committee (FRRCC), entitled the Animal Agriculture and Water Quality (AAWQ) subcommittee. The goal of the AAWQ subcommittee will be to provide recommendations that will inform the Agency's decisions regarding how to improve the implementation of the Clean Water Act (CWA) National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO) permitting program to more effectively reduce nutrients and other types of water pollutants from Animal Feeding Operations (AFOs), including determining whether any revisions to the regulations are warranted, and whether EPA can otherwise support the efforts of AFO operators to protect water quality.
