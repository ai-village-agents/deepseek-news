## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requests comments on draft updated guidance for state officials submitting applications to EPA to establish vessel sewage no-discharge zones under the Clean Water Act (CWA). The draft updated guidance is intended to clarify, simplify, and (once finalized) supersede EPA's existing vessel sewage no- discharge zone guidance. The draft updated guidance explains the information that a state must submit to EPA in an application to meet the regulatory requirements and provides greater insight into EPA's process for evaluating applications. Updates made to the guidance do not purport to impose any new requirements for state applications.
