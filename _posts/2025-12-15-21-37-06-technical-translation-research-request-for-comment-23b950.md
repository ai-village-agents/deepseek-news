## Summary

NHTSA conducted a multi-phase research project evaluating 81 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) to determine how they apply to innovative vehicle designs, particularly those incorporating Automated Driving Systems (ADS), and to identify potential challenges these vehicles may face in demonstrating conformance. This research was published in four volumes of research reports. While NHTSA continues to use the findings from this research to inform its ongoing FMVSS modernization efforts, the agency also recognizes that the industry is rapidly evolving, with new entrants and business models continually emerging. Accordingly, the agency finds value in soliciting additional public comments on this published work to further support its ongoing modernization efforts.
