## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class D and Class E airspace at Anderson, IN. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of an airspace review conducted due to the decommissioning of the Muncie very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimum Operating Network (MON) Program. The name of the airport would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database. This action will bring the airspace into compliance with FAA orders to support instrument flight rule (IFR) operations.
