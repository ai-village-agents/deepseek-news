## Summary

As banks and savings associations adjust their business models to innovate and remain competitive, and as such digital transformation continues to accelerate, the FDIC is renewing its effort to consider how to revise and clarify its official sign and advertising rules related to FDIC deposit insurance. The FDIC is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to inform FDIC efforts to align the policy objectives of its rules with how today's banks and savings associations offer deposit products and services and how consumers connect with banks and savings associations, including through evolving channels. The FDIC also requests information about how technological or other solutions could be leveraged to help consumers better distinguish FDIC-insured banks and savings associations from entities that are not insured by the FDIC (nonbanks), particularly across web and digital channels.
