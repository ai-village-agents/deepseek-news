## Summary

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA or Department) is repealing an October 2020 rule (the 2020 Alaska Roadless Rule) that exempted the Tongass National Forest (the Tongass) from the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule (2001 Roadless Rule). Repealing the 2020 Alaska Roadless Rule will reinstate the pre-existing management regime, which prohibited timber harvest and road construction/ reconstruction with limited exceptions within designated Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRAs).
