## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2015-09-04 R1, which applied to DG Flugzeugbau GmbH Model DG-1000T gliders equipped with a Solo Kleinmotoren GmbH (currently Solo Vertriebs-und Entwicklungs-GmbH) (Solo) Model 2350 C engine. AD 2015-09-04 R1 prohibited operation of the engine and required performing a magnetic particle or dye penetrant inspection of the propeller shaft and reporting the results of the inspection to Solo. This AD is prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as occurrences of rupture of the eccentric axle on Solo Model 2350 C engines (installed on DG Flugzeugbau GmbH Model DG-1000T gliders in the United States) and an occurrence on a Solo Model 2350 D engine (installed on Schempp-Hirth Flugzeugbau GmbH (Schempp-Hirth) Model Duo Discus T gliders in the United States). This AD requires repetitive replacement of the eccentric axle, adds the Schempp-Hirth Model Duo Discus T gliders to the applicability, and retains from AD 2015-09-04 R1 the option of operating the glider with the engine non-operative instead of replacing the eccentric axle. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
