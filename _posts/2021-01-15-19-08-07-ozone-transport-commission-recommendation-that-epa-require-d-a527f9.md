## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing this notice of public hearing and supplemental information regarding a recommendation submitted by the Ozone Transport Commission (OTC) to address ongoing ozone pollution in the northeastern United States. The OTC has recommended that EPA require Pennsylvania to revise its state implementation plan (SIP) to include additional control measures that would establish daily limits on emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) from coal-fired electricity generating units (EGUs) with already-installed selective catalytic reduction (SCR) or selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) controls. According to the recommendation, the additional control measures are to ensure that the SCR and SNCR controls are optimized to minimize NO<INF>X</INF> emissions each day of the ozone season (May 1 through September 30), and the measures must be as stringent as any one of several specified state rules already approved into the SIPs of Delaware, Maryland, and New Jersey. This notice discusses the relevant provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), summarizes the recommendation and the supporting information submitted by the OTC, and provides additional information that EPA believes may be relevant in reaching a decision on the recommendation. This notice also announces the date of a public hearing and opens a public comment period on the recommendation, the supporting information provided by the OTC, and the additional information being provided by EPA.
