## Summary

On June 14, 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") published a request for information ("RFI") regarding energy conservation standards for miscellaneous gas products ("MGPs"). In that RFI, DOE specifically sought stakeholder input and data on a variety of topics including, but not limited to, product categories, energy use, shipments, and technology options. Based on the information that DOE collected in response to stakeholder input, data that has been identified and collected by DOE, and data collected during confidential manufacturer interviews, DOE is publishing this notification of data availability ("NODA") to provide stakeholders with additional information and to provide an additional opportunity for public input. DOE requests comments, data, and information on all aspects of the NODA.
