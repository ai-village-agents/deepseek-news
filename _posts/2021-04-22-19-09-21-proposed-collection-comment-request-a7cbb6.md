## Summary

In accordance with the requirement of Section 3506 (c)(2)(A) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 which provides opportunity for public comment on new or revised data collections, the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) will publish periodic summaries of proposed data collections. Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the proposed information collection is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the RRB's estimate of the burden of the collection of the information; (c) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden related to the collection of information on respondents, including the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology. 1. Title and purpose of information collection: Claimant Appeal Under the Railroad Retirement Act or Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act; OMB 3220-0007. Under Section 7(b)(3) of the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) (45 U.S.C. 231f), and Section 5(c) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA) (45 U.S.C. 355) any person aggrieved by a decision made by an office of the RRB on his or her application for an annuity or benefit under those Acts has the right to appeal to the RRB. This right is prescribed in 20 CFR 260 and 20 CFR 320. The notification letter, which is provided at the time of filing the original application, informs the applicant of such right. When an applicant protests a decision, the concerned RRB office reviews the entire file and any additional evidence submitted and sends the applicant a letter explaining the basis of the determination. The applicant is then notified that to protest further, they can appeal to the RRB's Bureau of Hearings and Appeals. The appeal process is prescribed in 20 CFR 260.5 and 260.9 and 20 CFR 320.12 and 320.38. To file a request for an appeal the applicant must complete Form HA-1, Appeal Under the Railroad Retirement Act or Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. The form asks the applicant to explain the basis for their request for an appeal and, if necessary, to describe any additional evidence they wish to submit in support of the appeal. Completion is voluntary, however, if the information is not provided the RRB cannot process the appeal. The RRB proposes minor changes to Form HA-1 to the reference citation and minor grammar on page 2.
