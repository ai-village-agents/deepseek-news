## Summary

The Department of Justice is proposing to promulgate regulations ("proposed rule" or "rule") concerning the Child Protection Improvements Act of 2018 ("CPIA"). The CPIA provides a means by which authorized qualified entities can have access to national criminal history background checks for determinations of whether covered individuals have been convicted of, or are under pending indictment for, a crime that bears upon their fitness to have responsibility for the safety and well-being of children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities. As required by the CPIA, these proposed regulations would establish the criteria to be utilized by an entity designated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to make these determinations.
