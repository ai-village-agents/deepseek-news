## Summary

The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is amending the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to expand license requirements on exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of items intended for military end use or military end users in the People's Republic of China (China), Russia, or Venezuela. Specifically, this rule expands the licensing requirements for China to include "military end users," in addition to "military end use." It broadens the list of items for which the licensing requirements and review policy apply and expands the definition of "military end use." Next, it creates a new reason for control and the associated review policy for regional stability for certain items exported to China, Russia, or Venezuela, moving existing text related to this policy. Finally, it adds Electronic Export Information filing requirements in the Automated Export System for exports to China, Russia, and Venezuela. This rule supports the objectives discussed in the National Security Strategy of the United States.
