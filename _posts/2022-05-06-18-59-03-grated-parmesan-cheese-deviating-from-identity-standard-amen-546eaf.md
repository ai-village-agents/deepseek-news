## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is amending the temporary permit issued to Kraft Foods Inc. to market test a product designated as "100% Grated Parmesan Cheese" that deviates from the standards of identity for parmesan cheese and grated cheeses. Kraft Foods Inc.'s temporary permit is amended to identify Lactalis Heritage Dairy, Inc. (LHD) as the permit holder. This amendment will allow the permit holder to continue to test market the product and collect data on consumer acceptance.
