The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) is implementing this voluntary program for manufacturers of CDER-regulated drug products to gain experience with the prototype assessment protocol and to evaluate whether use of the protocol, as designed, will enable a meaningful assessment of the establishment's quality management practices while providing useful feedback for the establishment. This notice outlines the types of establishments FDA is seeking for participation and the process for submitting a request to participate in the program.
