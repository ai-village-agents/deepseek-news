## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a state implementation plan (SIP) revision formally submitted by the District of Columbia Department of Energy and the Environment (DOEE). Under the Clean Air Act (CAA), a state's SIP must include an emission statement regulation that requires stationary sources in ozone nonattainment areas classified as marginal or above to report annual emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) and volatile organic compounds (VOC). This SIP revision provides the District's certification that its existing emissions statement program satisfies the emissions statement requirements of the CAA for the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). EPA is proposing to approve the District's emissions statement program certification for the 2015 ozone NAAQS as a SIP revision in accordance with the requirements of the CAA.
