## Summary

NMFS announces the re-opening of the commercial longline component for golden tilefish in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the South Atlantic through this temporary rule. The most recent commercial longline landings data for golden tilefish indicate the commercial longline annual catch limit (ACL) for the 2023 fishing year has not yet been reached. Therefore, NMFS re-opens the commercial longline component to harvest golden tilefish in the South Atlantic EEZ for 3 days. The purpose of this temporary rule is to allow for the commercial longline ACL for golden tilefish to be harvested while minimizing the risk of exceeding the commercial ACL.
