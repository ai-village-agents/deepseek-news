## Summary

The Department of the Air Force (DAF) is issuing this Notice of Intent (NOI), in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) to evaluate the potential environmental impacts associated with transformation of the 492nd Special Operations Wing (492 SOW) into an Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) Power Projection Wing (PPW) at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base (AFB), Arizona. This PPW would include the 492 SOW, the 6th and 319th Special Operations Squadrons, an MC-130J squadron, activation of an Intelligence Squadron (IS) under the Air Combat Command (ACC) 361st Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Group (361 ISRG), and Special Tactics and Special Operations Theater Air Operations Squadrons. The beddown of the 492 SOW is planned as a replacement mission for the A-10 aircraft at Davis- Monthan as they retire. There will likely be a short-term temporary overlap of the 492 SOW mission with the A-10s until their retirement is complete.
