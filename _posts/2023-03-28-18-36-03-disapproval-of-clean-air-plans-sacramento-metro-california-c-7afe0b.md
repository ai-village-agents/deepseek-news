## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to disapprove under the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act") state implementation plan (SIP) submissions from the State of California that address contingency measures requirements for the 2008 ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or "standards") in the Sacramento Metro, California ozone nonattainment area. The SIP revisions include the portions of the following documents that address the contingency measures requirements: the "Sacramento Regional 2008 NAAQS 8-hour Ozone Attainment and Reasonable Further Progress Plan," submitted in 2017 ("2017 Sacramento Regional Ozone Plan"), and the Sacramento Metro portion of the "2018 Updates to the California State Implementation Plan" ("2018 SIP Update"). The EPA is proposing this disapproval because the SIP revisions do not provide for contingency measures that would be triggered if the area fails to attain the NAAQS or make reasonable further progress (RFP).
