## Summary

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) provides science to support the mission of the Department of the Interior. In the FY22 budget, Congress charged the USGS with developing an assessment of the linkages between biodiversity and climate change. The USGS, in collaboration with Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) and Mexico's La Comisi[oacute]n Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad (CONABIO), and with assistance from the Morris K. Udall and Stewart L. Udall Foundation's John S. McCain III National Center for Environmental Conflict Resolution (National Center), will undertake a two-year (2023- 2025) regional assessment of biodiversity and climate change, culminating in the first-ever assessment report addressing these two challenges together for the United States, Canada, Mexico, U.S. territories, and Freely Associated States. This notice announces the opportunity for the public to comment on the draft prospectus for the assessment, provide nominations for membership on the assessment authoring team (administered by the USGS), and provide expressions of interest in serving on the Biodiversity and Climate Change Assessment Guidance Committee (Guidance Committee) which will be convened by the National Center.
