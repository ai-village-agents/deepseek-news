## Summary

EIA has submitted an information collection request for extension as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The information collection requests a three-year extension of its Oil and Gas Reserves System Surveys, OMB No. 1905-0057: Extension without changes of Form EIA-64A, Annual Report of the Origin of Natural Gas Liquids Production; Revision of Form EIA-23L, Annual Report of Domestic Oil and Gas Reserves, County Level Report; and continued suspension of Form EIA-23S, Annual Survey of Domestic Oil and Gas Reserves, Summary Level Report. Form EIA-23L is the only form that EIA proposes to change. There are no proposed changes to Forms EIA-64A and EIA-23S. The proposed collection will be used to prepare electronic annual reports of U.S. proved reserves data that fulfill EIA's congressional mandate to provide accurate annual estimates of U.S. proved crude oil and natural gas reserves. The U.S. Government also uses the resulting information in EIA's reports to develop national and regional estimates of proved reserves of domestic crude oil and natural gas to facilitate national energy policy decisions.
