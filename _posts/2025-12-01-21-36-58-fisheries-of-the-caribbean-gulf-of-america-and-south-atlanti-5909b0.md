## Summary

NMFS implements an accountability measure for the commercial harvest of gag in South Atlantic Federal waters. NMFS projects that commercial landings of gag will reach the commercial annual catch limit (ACL) for 2025. Therefore, NMFS closes the commercial sector of gag in South Atlantic Federal waters to protect the gag resource from overfishing.
