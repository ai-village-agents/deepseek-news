## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited Model DHC-8-401 and - 402 airplanes. This AD was prompted by an investigation of incorrectly manufactured sleeves that were potentially installed in the main landing gear (MLG) forward door linkage assembly. This AD requires review of technical records and inspections to determine if a discrepant sleeve is installed, replacement of any discrepant sleeve and re-identification of the MLG forward door linkage assembly. This AD also prohibits the installation of affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
