## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report indicating that the vertical stop support fitting (VSSF) of certain captain's, first officer's, and third occupant's seats could fail. This proposed AD would require modifying or replacing each affected seat, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. This proposed AD would also limit the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
