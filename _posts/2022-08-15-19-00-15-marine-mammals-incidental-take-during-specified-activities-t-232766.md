## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in response to a request from the United States Coast Guard, propose to issue regulations authorizing the nonlethal, incidental, unintentional take by harassment of small numbers of northern sea otters during marine construction and pile driving in the Gulf of Alaska coastal waters. Take may result from marine construction and pile-driving activities. This proposed rule would authorize take by harassment only. No lethal take would be authorized. If this proposed rule is finalized, we will issue letters of authorization, upon request, for specific proposed activities in accordance with the final rule for a period of 5 years. Therefore, we request comments on these proposed regulations.
