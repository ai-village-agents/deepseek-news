The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving the redesignation of the Salt Lake City, Utah and Provo, Utah nonattainment areas (NAAs) to attainment for the 2006 24-hour fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 2.5 microns (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), and also approving multiple related State Implementation Plan (SIP) submissions. We are approving SIP revisions submitted by the State of Utah on January 19, 2017; February 4 and 15, 2019; January 13, 2020; December 17, 2020; and July 15, 2025.
