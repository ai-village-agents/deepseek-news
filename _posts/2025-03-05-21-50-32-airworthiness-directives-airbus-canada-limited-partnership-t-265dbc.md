## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500- 1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that the nose radome lightning diverter strips on certain aircraft were painted in production; paint on the diverter strips can compromise the nose radome lightning protection. This AD requires inspecting for paint on the diverter strips on the nose radome, and replacing the nose radome if necessary, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
