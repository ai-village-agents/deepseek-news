## Summary

In this document, the Wireline Competition Bureau (Bureau) grants, in part, the Petition for Waiver filed by a group of Emergency Connectivity Fund Program stakeholders by waiving and extending the service delivery date to June 30, 2023 for all applicants who applied for Emergency Connectivity Fund support for equipment, other non- recurring services, and recurring services during the first and second application filing windows. The Bureau finds that due to the concurrent timing of the funding request processing and other factors beyond Emergency Connectivity Fund Program participants' control, certain first and second window applicants may not be able to use their committed funding to the full extent possible. The Bureau modifies the procedural rule and directs the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), the Administrator of the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program, to use June 30, 2023 as the service delivery date for all requests for equipment, other non-recurring services, and recurring services submitted during the first and second Emergency Connectivity Fund Program application filing windows.
