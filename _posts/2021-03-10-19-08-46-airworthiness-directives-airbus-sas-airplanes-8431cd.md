## Summary

The FAA is correcting an airworthiness directive (AD) that published in the Federal Register. That AD applies to all Airbus SAS Model A330-200 series airplanes, Model A330-200 Freighter series airplanes, Model A330-300 series airplanes, Model A330-900 series airplanes, Model A340-200 series airplanes, Model A340-300 series airplanes, Model A340-500 series airplanes, Model A340-600 series airplanes, Model A380-800 series airplanes; and Model A350-941 and - 1041 airplanes. As published, multiple references to a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD number are incorrect throughout the AD. This document corrects those errors. In all other respects, the original document remains the same.
