## Summary

The Commission hereby gives notice of the scheduling of the final phase of countervailing duty investigation No. 701-TA-757 (Final) pursuant to the Tariff Act of 1930 to determine whether an industry in the United States is materially injured or threatened with material injury, or the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded, by reason of imports of polypropylene corrugated boxes ("PC boxes") from China, provided for in subheadings 3923.10.90 and 3923.50.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, preliminarily determined by the Department of Commerce ("Commerce") to be subsidized by the Government of China. Commerce's preliminary determinations with respect to PC boxes from China and Vietnam, alleged to be sold in the United States at less than fair value, are pending.
