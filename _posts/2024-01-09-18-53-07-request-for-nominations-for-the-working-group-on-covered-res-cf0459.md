The Working Group will conduct a study on access to covered resources for infrastructure projects. In carrying out the study, the Working Group shall analyze the use of covered resources in transportation projects funded with Federal dollars; how the proximity of covered resources to such projects affects the cost and environmental impact of those projects; whether and how State, Tribal, and local transportation and planning agencies consider covered resources when developing transportation projects; and any challenges for transportation project sponsors regarding access and proximity to covered resources. The Working Group shall submit to the Secretary of Transportation the findings of its study and any recommendations to preserve access to and reduce the costs and environmental impacts of covered resources in infrastructure projects.
