## Summary

Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-108, notice is hereby given that the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office), a component within the United States Department of Justice (DOJ or Department), proposes to develop a new system of records notice titled COPS Management System: NexGen (CMS:NxG), JUSTICE/COPS-003. The COPS Office proposes to establish this system of records to consolidate its various business databases, applications, and web applications under one umbrella to support the grant-making and grant management processes from the pre-award phase, including posting solicitations and administering applications for COPS Office funding, to the post-award phase, including budget modifications and award monitoring activities. Previously, grant-making and grant management was handled by a legacy system covered under the DOJ-003 Correspondence Management Systems (CMS) SORN. Because certain aspects of NexGen are more consistent with a separate system of records, COPS is issuing a new SORN to make that clear.
