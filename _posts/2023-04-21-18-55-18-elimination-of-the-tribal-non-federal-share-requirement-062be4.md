## Summary

OCSE proposes to eliminate the non-Federal share of program expenditures requirement for Tribal child support enforcement programs including the 90/10 and 80/20 cost sharing rates. Based upon the experiences of and consultations with Tribes and Tribal organizations, we have determined that the non-Federal share requirement limits growth, causes disruptions, and creates instability.
