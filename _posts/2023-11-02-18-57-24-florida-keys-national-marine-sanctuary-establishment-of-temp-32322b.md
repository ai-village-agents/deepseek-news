## Summary

On September 6, 2023, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued a final temporary rule establishing a special use area of a 0.07 square mile area approximately five miles southeast of the community of Tavernier, on the island of Key Largo, within Federal waters of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) from September 6, 2023, through November 6, 2023. This document extends the temporary special use area an additional 60 days. The special use area prohibits all entry except for restoration activities under a valid Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS) permit, continuous transit without interruption, and for law enforcement purposes from November 6, 2023, to January 5, 2024. This temporary extension is necessary to prevent or minimize destruction of, loss of, or injury to sanctuary resources, specifically to facilitate restoration activities to improve or repair living habitats through protecting coral nursery stock at this site from potential impacts caused by anchor damage and/or fishing gear. This extension is necessary to protect the corals in the temporary special use area until all of the corals are moved back to the original in-shore permitted nursery site. This temporary special use area will expire within 120 days from the date it was established.
