## Summary

This notice announces that the Designated Federal Officer of the Department of the Treasury Tribal Advisory Committee (TTAC), established pursuant to the Tribal General Welfare Exclusion Act of 2014 (TGWEA), seeks nominations on behalf of the Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary) for the appointment of one member to the TTAC. Under section 3 of the TGWEA, the TTAC was established to advise the Secretary on matters related to the taxation of Indians, training and education for Internal Revenue Service (IRS) field agents who administer and enforce internal revenue laws with respect to Indian tribes, and training and technical assistance for tribal financial officers. Nominations should describe the candidate's qualifications for TTAC membership. Submittal of an application and resume is required. This request for nominations, particularly from tribal leaders, is in furtherance of the objectives of the Presidential Memorandum of January 26, 2021 (Tribal Consultation and Strengthening Nation-to-Nation Relationships), which requires each agency to prepare and periodically update a detailed plan of action to implement the policies and directives of an Executive Order under which the Department of the Treasury consults with tribal officials in the development of Federal policies that have Tribal implications, to reinforce the United States government-to-government relationships with Indian tribes, and to reduce the imposition of unfunded mandates upon Indian tribes.
