## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A320-214, -216, -231, -232, -233, -251N, and -271N airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that following the installation of a second cargo fire extinguishing bottle, insufficient clearance between the cargo compartment fire extinguishing pipes was found. This proposed AD would require inspection and modification of the cargo compartment fire extinguishing pipes, and on- condition actions if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which will be incorporated by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
