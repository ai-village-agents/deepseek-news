## Summary

The FAA is revising a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that would have applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A319-115 airplanes; Model A320-214, -216, -232, -251N, and -271N airplanes; and Model A321- 211, -231, -251N, -251NX, -252NX, -253N, -253NX, -271N, -271NX, and - 272N airplanes. This action revises the NPRM by adding Model A321-213 airplanes, which were inadvertently left out of the applicability. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive (AD) to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over those in the NPRM, the FAA is requesting comments on this SNPRM.
