## Summary

This proposed rule would add species or groups of species to the Seafood Import Monitoring Program (SIMP) established pursuant to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA). In addition, this proposed rule would amend SIMP regulations to clarify the responsibilities of the importer of record; amend the definition of importer of record to more closely align with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) definition; amend the language requiring chain of custody records to be made available for audit or inspection to add a requirement that such records be made available through digital means if requested by NMFS; clarify the Aggregated Harvest Report criteria; and clarify the application of SIMP requirements to imports into the Pacific Insular Areas.
