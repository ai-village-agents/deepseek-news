## Summary

The FAA proposes to amend the flight instructor certificate renewal requirements by changing the existing renewal requirements to recent experience requirements and adding a new method for persons to establish recent flight instructor experience. This rulemaking would also allow a flight instructor whose recent experience has lapsed by no more than three calendar months to reinstate flight instructor privileges by taking an approved flight instructor refresher course rather than completing a flight instructor certification practical test. Additionally, the FAA proposes to amend the qualification requirements for flight instructors seeking to provide training to initial flight instructor applicants by adding two new methods under which a flight instructor may become qualified to provide this training. Lastly, the FAA proposes to relocate and codify the requirements of a Special Federal Aviation Regulation into the regulations.
