## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-1A10 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report indicating that the clearance between therapeutic flexible oxygen hoses and electrical harnesses may be non-compliant to design requirements, and that positive separation mechanisms and appropriate protective barriers may not have been installed in accordance with the applicable installation standards. This AD requires a detailed inspection of the therapeutic flexible oxygen hose for damage and protection, and the electrical harnesses for damage; a detailed inspection for the clearance between the therapeutic oxygen rigid tube to oxygen hose elbow fitting (also referred to as elbow fitting), if applicable, and the nearest electrical harness, and between the therapeutic flexible oxygen hose and electrical harness; and applicable related investigative and corrective actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
