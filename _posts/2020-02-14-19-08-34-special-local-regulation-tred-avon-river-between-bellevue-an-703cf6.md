## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish temporary special local regulations for certain waters of the Tred Avon River. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters located between Bellevue, MD, and Oxford, MD, during a swim event on June 6, 2020. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from entering the regulated area unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Maryland-National Capital Region or the Coast Guard Patrol Commander. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
