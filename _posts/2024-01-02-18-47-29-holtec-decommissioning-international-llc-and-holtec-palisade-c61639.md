## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has issued an exemption in response to a request from Holtec Decommissioning International, LLC (HDI), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Holtec International, that would allow HDI and Holtec Palisades, LLC, regarding certain emergency planning (EP) requirements. The exemption eliminates the requirements to maintain an offsite radiological emergency preparedness plan and reduce the scope of onsite EP activities at the Palisades Nuclear Plant, based on the reduced risks of accidents that could result in an offsite radiological release at a decommissioning nuclear power reactor.
