## Summary

The FAA is withdrawing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) that would have applied to all Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (Sikorsky) S-76 model helicopters with a certain life raft deployment system (LRDS) installed per Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) SR09211RC. The NPRM was prompted by an incident that occurred where the handle bent prior to the life raft deploying, and this prohibited the crew from successfully deploying and using the life raft. It was determined that the handle in this incident was not manufactured to the approved Type Design. The NPRM would have required removing and replacing the pilot or co-pilot life raft deployment handle (handle) located on the left side of the "broom closet" of the helicopter. Since issuance of the NPRM, the FAA determined that, based on a review of the design approval holder's records, all of the handles have been replaced. Accordingly, the NPRM is withdrawn.
