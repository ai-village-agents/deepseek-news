## Summary

On April 11, 2023, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR), in which DOE proposed regulations regarding procedures for calculating a value for the petroleum equivalent fuel economy of electric vehicles (EVs) for use in the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program administered by the Department of Transportation (DOT). In their comments to DOE's NOPR, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation (Auto Innovators) raised the issue of the ability of manufacturers to comply with the proposed PEF in 2027 due to vehicle design cycles. DOE is providing notice that it sent follow-up letters to member companies of the Auto Innovators inviting the companies to provide information to clarify the challenges to implementing the revised standard to apply to model year (MY) 2027- 2031 vehicles as proposed. In this notice and request for comment, DOE requests additional comment on the questions posed to the Auto Innovator members providing a similar opportunity to all stakeholders.
