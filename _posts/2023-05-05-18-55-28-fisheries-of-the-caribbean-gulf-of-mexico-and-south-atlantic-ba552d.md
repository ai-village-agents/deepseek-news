## Summary

NMFS proposes to implement management measures described in a framework action under the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP) as prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council). If implemented for gray triggerfish in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf), this proposed rule would increase the commercial trip limit from 16 fish to 25 fish. The purpose of this action is to increase the gray triggerfish commercial trip limit to allow commercial fishermen the opportunity to harvest the commercial annual catch target (ACT).
