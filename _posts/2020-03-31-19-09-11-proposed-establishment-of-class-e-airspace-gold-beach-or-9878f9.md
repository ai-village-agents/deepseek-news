## Summary

This action proposes to establish Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet or more at Gold Beach Municipal Airport, Gold Beach, OR. The airspace is designed to accommodate a new IFR area navigation (RNAV) approach and IFR departure procedures at the airport, which will support the airport's transition from VFR to IFR operations. The first area will extend upward from 700 feet above the surface and the second area will extend upward from 1,200 feet above the surface. This action would ensure the safety and management of IFR operations at the airport.
