## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-23- 06, which applied to certain The Boeing Company Model 757-200, -200CB, and -300 series airplanes. AD 2019-23-06 required, depending on configuration, a general visual inspection for any previous repair, such as any reinforcing repair or local frame replacement repair, repetitive open hole high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections for any crack of the fuselage frame web fastener holes, on the left and right side of the airplane, and applicable on-condition actions. This AD was prompted by a determination that certain compliance times must be reduced. This AD requires the actions specified in AD 2019-23-06 with reduced compliances times for certain actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
