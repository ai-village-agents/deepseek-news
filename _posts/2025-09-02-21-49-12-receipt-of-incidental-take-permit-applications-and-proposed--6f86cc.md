## Summary

We, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce receipt of four separate applications from each of the following applicants for an incidental take permit (ITP) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA): Lindsey and Associates, LLC; Seahaven Farms, LLC; Emmer Holdings, LLC; and Greg Smith (applicant/applicants). Each applicant requests an ITP to take the federally listed Alabama beach mouse incidental to the construction of single-family homes in Baldwin County, Alabama. We request public comment on the applications, which include each applicants' proposed habitat conservation plans (HCPs) and on the Service's preliminary determination that the proposed permitting actions may be eligible for a categorical exclusion pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Department of Interior's (DOI) NEPA regulations, and the DOI Departmental Manual (DM). To make these preliminary determinations, we prepared a draft screening form and NEPA statement for each application, which are available for public review. We invite comment from the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies.
