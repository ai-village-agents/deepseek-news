## Summary

The Department of Energy (DOE or the Department) is publishing its intended allocation formula that will be used to distribute funds to Indian Tribes through the $225 million Tribal Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates program. The purpose of the Tribal Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates program is to help Tribal households to reduce energy bills, increase home comfort, improve indoor air quality, and reduce emissions by providing direct funding for energy efficiency and electrification home upgrades. This notice provides the tentative allocation formula developed by the Department to distribute funds to Tribes, as well as the allocation amounts and data used to calculate allocations. This notice also describes how Tribes may partner with other Tribes through consortia to submit a single application to DOE, and how Tribes may authorize a third-party agent to handle the application and administration of a grant award.
