## Summary

NMFS received a request from Phillips 66 for the renewal of their currently active incidental harassment authorization (IHA) (hereinafter, the "initial IHA") to take marine mammals incidental to Ferndale Refinery Dock Maintenance and Pile Replacement Activities in Ferndale, Washington. Activities described in the initial IHA will not be completed prior its expiration. IHA Renewal activities are nearly identical to those covered in the initial authorization. Pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), prior to issuing the initial IHA, NMFS requested comments on both the proposed IHA and the potential for renewing the initial IHA if certain requirements were satisfied. The renewal requirements have been satisfied, and NMFS is now providing an additional 15-day comment period to allow for any additional comments on the proposed renewal not previously provided during the initial 30-day comment period.
