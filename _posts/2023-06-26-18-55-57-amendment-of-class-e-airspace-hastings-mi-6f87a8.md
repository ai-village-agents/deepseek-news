This action amends the Class E airspace at Hastings, MI. This action is the result of an airspace review caused by the decommissioning of the Grand Rapids very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimum Operating Network (MON) Program. The name and geographic coordinates of the airport are also being updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
