## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace at New Lexington, OH. The name and geographic coordinates of Ed Newlon Field, New Lexington, OH, would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of airspace reviews conducted due to the decommissioning of the Zanesville very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program. This action would bring the airspace into compliance with FAA orders and support instrument flight rule (IFR) procedures and operations.
