## Summary

On October 24, 2022, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (together, the agencies) published in the Federal Register an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) to solicit public input regarding whether an extra layer of loss-absorbing capacity could improve optionality in resolving a large banking organization or its insured depository institution, and the costs and benefits of such a requirement. The agencies have determined that an extension of the comment period until January 23, 2023, is appropriate, and are therefore making that extension.
