## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is amending its Microloan Program regulations to reflect statutory changes to the Microloan Program contained in the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act. The changes increase the total amount an Intermediary may borrow under the Microloan Program per year and in aggregate, expand eligibility for Intermediaries to receive a bonus grant and add the necessary definitions, and revise the eligible base grant award amount for Intermediaries under certain circumstances. This direct final rule conforms the regulations to the Act by adopting the new statutory requirements without change.
