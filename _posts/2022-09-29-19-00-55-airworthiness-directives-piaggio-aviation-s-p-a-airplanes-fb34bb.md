## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Piaggio Aviation S.p.A. (Piaggio) Model P-180 airplanes. This AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as accumulation of water and subsequent freezing in the pitot-tube, which results in pitot-tube blockage. This AD requires modifying the total air temperature (TAT) probe heater electrical circuit and revising your existing airplane flight manual (AFM). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
