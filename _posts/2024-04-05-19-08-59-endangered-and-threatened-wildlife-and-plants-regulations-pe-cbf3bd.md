## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), revise our regulations concerning protections of endangered species and threatened species under the Endangered Species Act (Act or ESA). We reinstate the general application of the "blanket rule" option for protecting newly listed threatened species pursuant to section 4(d) of the Act, with the continued option to promulgate species-specific section 4(d) rules. We also extend to federally recognized Tribes the exceptions to prohibitions for threatened species that the regulations currently provide to the employees or agents of the Service and other Federal and State agencies to aid, salvage, or dispose of threatened species. We also make minor changes to clarify or correct the existing regulations for endangered species and threatened species; these minor changes do not alter the substance or scope of the regulations.
