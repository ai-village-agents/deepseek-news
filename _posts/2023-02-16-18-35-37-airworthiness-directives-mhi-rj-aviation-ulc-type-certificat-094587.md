## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all MHI RJ Aviation ULC Model CL-600-2B19 (Regional Jet Series 100 & 440); CL-600-2C10 (Regional Jet Series 700, 701, & 702); CL-600-2C11 (Regional Jet Series 550); CL-600-2D15 (Regional Jet Series 705); CL- 600-2D24 (Regional Jet Series 900); and CL-600-2E25 (Regional Jet Series 1000) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that aircraft maintenance manual (AMM) tasks and certification maintenance requirement (CMR) tasks are necessary. This proposed AD would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive AMM and CMR tasks. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
