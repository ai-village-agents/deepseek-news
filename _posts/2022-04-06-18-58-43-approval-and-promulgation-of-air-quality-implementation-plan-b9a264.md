## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a state implementation plan (SIP) revision, made in two separate submittals, by the State of Delaware. This revision removes requirements for gasoline vapor recovery systems installed on gasoline dispensers, the purpose of which are to capture emissions from vehicle refueling operations, otherwise known as Stage II vapor recovery. This revision also strengthens Delaware's requirements for gasoline vapor recovery systems that capture emissions from storage tank refueling operations, otherwise known as Stage I vapor recovery. Specifically, this action would remove from the approved SIP prior-approved Stage II requirements applicable to new and existing gasoline dispensing facilities (GDFs). New and existing GDF's will be required to decommission their Stage II vapor recovery systems (VRS) and to install, maintain, and periodically test Stage I enhanced vapor recovery systems (EVRS). Delaware's SIP revision establishes a compliance schedule for these changes and includes a demonstration that removal of Stage II requirements is consistent with the Clean Air Act (CAA) and meets all relevant EPA guidance.
