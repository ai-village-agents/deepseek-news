## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain International Aero Engines AG (IAE) V2522-A5, V2524-A5, V2525- D5, V2527-A5, V2527E-A5, V2527M-A5, V2528-D5, V2530-A5, and V2533-A5 model turbofan engines. This emergency AD was sent previously to all known U.S. owners and operators of these engines. This AD requires removal of affected high-pressure turbine (HPT) 1st-stage disks from service. This AD was prompted by investigative findings from an event involving an uncontained failure of a HPT 1st-stage disk that resulted in high-energy debris penetrating the engine cowling. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
