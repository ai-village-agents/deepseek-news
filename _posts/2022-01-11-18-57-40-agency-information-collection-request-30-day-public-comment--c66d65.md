## Summary

In compliance with the requirement of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the Office of the Secretary (OS), Department of Health and Human Services, is publishing the following summary of a proposed collection for public comment. Since March 29, 2020, the U.S. government has been collecting data from hospitals and states to understand health care system stress, capacity, capabilities, and the number of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. As the COVID-19 response continues to evolve, Federal needs for data are also evolving. The data elements within the collection are being altered to best meet the needs of the current response to COVID-19. This alteration includes the addition of data elements collecting more detailed information on pediatric hospitalizations, which will help to better understand pediatric hospital surge as well as inform epidemiologic surveillance to inform potential response actions. The alteration also includes making various data elements inactive for federal data collection based on current and anticipated future federal response needs, as well as reduce burden where possible. While inactive, these data elements will still be considered as remaining part of the data collection to allow jurisdictions to continue collecting the information if it is needed for their unique response needs.
