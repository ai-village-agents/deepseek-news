## Summary

This final rule updates the prospective payment rates, the outlier threshold, and the wage index for Medicare inpatient hospital services provided by Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities (IPF), which include psychiatric hospitals and excluded psychiatric units of an acute care hospital or critical access hospital. This final rule establishes a permanent mitigation policy to smooth the impact of year- to-year changes in IPF payments related to decreases in the IPF wage index. In addition, this final rule includes responses to public comments received on the results of the data analysis of the IPF Prospective Payment System (PPS) adjustments. These changes will be effective for IPF discharges occurring during the Fiscal Year (FY) beginning October 1, 2022, through September 30, 2023 (FY 2023). Lastly, this final rule includes public comments received in response to requests for information that appeared in the FY 2023 IPF PPS proposed rule.
