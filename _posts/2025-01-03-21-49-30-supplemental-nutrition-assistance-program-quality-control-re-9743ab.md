## Summary

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (the Department) is issuing this proposed rule to formally incorporate by reference the FNS Handbook 310 into SNAP regulations. By doing so, the Department is ensuring that the public receives a notice and comment period prior to implementation of revisions to the Handbook, which is the standard operating procedure manual for conducting quality control (QC) reviews of SNAP cases. The Department also proposes to remove reference to FNS Handbook 311 until it can be incorporated by reference. The Department requests comment on these proposed provisions.
