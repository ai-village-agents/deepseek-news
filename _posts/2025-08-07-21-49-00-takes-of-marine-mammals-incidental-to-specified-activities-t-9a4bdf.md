## Summary

NMFS has received a request from the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities (ADOT&PF) for the reissuance of a previously issued incidental harassment authorization (IHA) with the only change being effective dates. The initial IHA authorized take of eleven species of marine mammals, by harassment only, incidental to construction activities associated with the Auke Bay East Ferry Terminal in Juneau, Alaska. The project has been delayed and none of the work associated with the initial IHA has been conducted. The initial IHA was effective from October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025. ADOT&PF has requested reissuance with new effective dates of October 1, 2026 through September 30, 2027. The scope of the activities and anticipated effects remain the same, authorized take numbers are not changed, and the required mitigation, monitoring, and reporting remains the same as included in the initial IHA. NMFS is, therefore, issuing a second identical IHA to cover the incidental take analyzed and authorized in the initial IHA.
