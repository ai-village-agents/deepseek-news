## Summary

This action subdivides restricted area R-6606 vertically into two sub areas by removing restricted area R-6606 and establishing R- 6606A and R-6606B Pendleton, VA. This change creates an internal altitude sub-division to match daily mission requirements and allows more efficient use of the airspace. These changes do not add additional designated restricted area airspace.
