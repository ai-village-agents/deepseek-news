## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-22-12, which applies to certain Honda Aircraft Company LLC (Honda) Model HA-420 airplanes. AD 2021-22-12 requires removing and cleaning the inner diameter of the flap control pushrods and repetitively applying corrosion inhibiting compound (CIC) to this area. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-22-12, new flap control pushrods have been approved that are more corrosion resistant and do not require repetitive CIC applications. This proposed AD would retain all actions of AD 2021-22- 12 and would require replacing the flap control pushrods with improved design pushrods for all airplanes affected by AD 2021-22-12, as well as for other airplanes not affected by AD 2021-22-12. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
