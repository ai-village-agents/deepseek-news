## Summary

The U.S. Department of Labor (the Department) is rescinding its regulations implementing the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA) containing the nondiscrimination and equal-opportunity provisions of WIA. In 2014, Congress passed the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), which repealed WIA and required the Secretary of Labor to transition any authority under WIA to the system created by WIOA. Therefore, the Department is taking this action to remove regulations for a program that is no longer operative.
