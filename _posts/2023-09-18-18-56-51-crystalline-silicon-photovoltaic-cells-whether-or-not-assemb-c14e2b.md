## Summary

On June 13, 2023, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) received a request for revocation, in part, of the antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells, whether or not assembled into modules (solar cells), from the People's Republic of China (China) from SOURCE Global, PBC (SOURCE Global) with respect to certain off-grid small portable crystalline silicon photovoltaic (CSPV) panels as described below. We preliminary determine to revoke, in part, the solar cells AD and CVD orders with respect to these products. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.
