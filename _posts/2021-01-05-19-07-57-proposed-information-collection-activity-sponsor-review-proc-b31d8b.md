## Summary

This information collection consists of several instruments that allow the Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) Program to assess the ability of potential sponsors to provide for the physical and mental well-being of the UAC and whether the UAC will be safe in the custody of the potential sponsor. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is inviting public comments on proposed revisions to the Sponsor Verification Application (formerly the Family Reunification Application); and the Sponsor Care Agreement. Revisions to the Sponsor Care Agreement change the categorization from supplementary material to an information collection and associated burden has been included in this update.
