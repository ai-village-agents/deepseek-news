## Summary

The Clean Air Act (CAA) requires each state implementation plan (SIP) to contain adequate provisions prohibiting emissions that will significantly contribute to nonattainment or interfere with maintenance of air quality in other states. The State of Arizona submitted a SIP revision to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to address these requirements for the 2015 ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). The EPA is proposing to approve Arizona's SIP submission as meeting the requirement that the Arizona SIP contain adequate provisions to prohibit emissions that will significantly contribute to nonattainment or interfere with maintenance of the 2015 ozone NAAQS in any other state.
