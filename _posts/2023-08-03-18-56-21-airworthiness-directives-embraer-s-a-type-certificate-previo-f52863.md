## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Embraer S.A. Model ERJ 190-300 and -400 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of missing parts on the main landing gear (MLG) side stay upper spindle assembly. This AD requires inspection of the left-hand (LH) and right-hand (RH) MLG side stay upper spindle assembly attachments, and corrective actions if necessary, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
