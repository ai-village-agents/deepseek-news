## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 767-2C series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of multiple nuisance caution "RECIRC SMOKE" engine indication and crew alerting system (EICAS) messages that may occur when water accumulates in the alternative ventilation system (AVS) duct. This AD requires replacing the alternative ventilation duct having a certain part number with a new part number, and for certain airplanes, changing the insulation blanket to install the drain hose. This AD also prohibits the installation of an alternative ventilation duct, part number (P/N) 216T2101-704, on any airplane. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
