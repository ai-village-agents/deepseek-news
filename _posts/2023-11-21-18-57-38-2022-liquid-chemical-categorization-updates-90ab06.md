## Summary

The Coast Guard is issuing this final rule to align liquid chemical categorization tables in its tank vessels and bulk dangerous cargo regulations with the 2020 Edition of the International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk. The updated tables provide a list of the liquid hazardous materials, liquefied gases, and compressed gases approved for international and domestic maritime transportation and indicate how each substance is categorized by its pollution potential, safe carriage requirements, chemical flammability, combustibility, and compatibility with other substances. This rule imposes no additional costs to chemical shippers or vessel owners.
