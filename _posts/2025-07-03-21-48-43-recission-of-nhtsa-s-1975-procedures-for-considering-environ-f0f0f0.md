## Summary

This interim final rule rescinds the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) 1975 Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts from the Code of Federal Regulations because they are outdated, because they were promulgated on the basis of authorities that have been rescinded, and because the Department of Transportation has promulgated updated Department-wide National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) procedures that will guide NHTSA's NEPA process.
