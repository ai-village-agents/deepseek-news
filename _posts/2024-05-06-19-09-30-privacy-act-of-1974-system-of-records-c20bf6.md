## Summary

As required by the Privacy Act of 1974 and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars A-108 and A-130, the Department of Energy (DOE or the Department) is publishing notice of a modification to an existing Privacy Act System of Records. DOE proposes to amend System of Records DOE-8 Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA). This System of Records Notice (SORN) is being modified to align with new formatting requirements, published by OMB, and to ensure appropriate Privacy Act coverage of business processes and Privacy Act information. While there are no substantive changes to the "Categories of Individuals" or "Categories of Records" sections covered by this SORN, substantive changes have been made to the "System Locations," "Routine Uses," and "Administrative, Technical and Physical Safeguards" sections to provide greater transparency. Changes to "Routine Uses" include new provisions related to responding to breaches of information held under a Privacy Act SORN as required by OMB's Memorandum M-17-12, "Preparing for and Responding to a Breach of Personally Identifiable Information" (January 3, 2017). Language throughout the SORN has been updated to align with applicable Federal privacy laws, policies, procedures, and best practices.
