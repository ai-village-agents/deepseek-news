## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled "Compliance Policy Regarding Blood and Blood Component Donation Suitability, Donor Eligibility and Source Plasma Quarantine Hold Requirements." The guidance document addresses certain requirements that apply to blood establishments that collect blood and blood components, including Source Plasma. Specifically, the guidance explains the conditions under which FDA does not intend to take regulatory action for a blood establishment's failure to comply with certain requirements in FDA's regulations regarding donation suitability, donor eligibility, and quarantine hold for Source Plasma. FDA expects that the compliance policy described in the guidance will increase the availability of blood and blood components, including Source Plasma, while maintaining the health of blood donors and the safety of blood and blood components. The guidance announced in this document finalizes the draft guidance of the same title dated May 2022, and supersedes the guidance entitled "Alternative Procedures for Blood and Blood Components During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency; Guidance for Industry," dated April 2020.
