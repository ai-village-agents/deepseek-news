## Summary

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks comments on NIST's Research Data Framework (RDaF or Framework). The RDaF is a tool that aims to help shape the future of open data access and research data management. A broader range of stakeholder views is needed for refining the next version of the RDaF. The current draft of the RDaF is available electronically from the NIST website at: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1500-18r1. All individuals and organizations with influence on and who are influenced by research data management are encouraged to offer their input.
