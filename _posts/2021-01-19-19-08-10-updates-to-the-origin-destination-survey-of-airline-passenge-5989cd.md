## Summary

The Department is proposing to update the method of collecting and processing aviation traffic data in the Origin-Destination Survey of Airline Passenger Traffic (O&D Survey), as well as to expand the number of reporting air carriers, the sample size collected, and the scope of the data reported. These changes would align the current O&D Survey with modern industry business and accounting practices, enable cost savings, reduce burden through automation, and provide enhanced utility for users of the data. In addition, DOT is proposing to change the timing of the release of the Form 41, Schedule T-100(f) "Foreign Air Carrier Traffic Data by Nonstop Segment and On-flight Market" from a 6-month delay to a 3-month delay to match that of Form 41, Schedule T-100 "Air Carrier Traffic and Capacity Data by Non-Stop Segment and On-Flight Market."
