## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-1A11 (600), CL-600-2A12 (601), and CL-600-2B16 (601-3A, 601-3R, and 604 Variants) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that some rudder power control unit (PCU) load limiters were found in service with the crimping missing from the end cap; therefore, the pilot command from the load limiter might not transmit correctly. This proposed AD would require a one-time inspection of the rudder PCU load limiters for correct crimping of the end cap, and replacing any defective rudder PCU load limiter. For certain airplanes, this proposed AD would also require repetitive testing of the rudder PCU load limiter for correct functioning, and applicable corrective actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
