## Summary

The U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology (OST-R), is seeking information from the public, industry, technology developers, State, local, and tribal transportation agencies, researchers, and other stakeholders. The focus of this request is to seek public and stakeholder input on the research and development activities needed to modernize the nation's transportation system through the application of digital infrastructure at scale. Responses will inform a coordinated national strategy for the development and deployment of Transportation Digital Infrastructure (TDI). This strategy will serve as the framework for the next generation of the transportation system across all modes (highway, rail, air, maritime, transit, pipeline) supporting multimodal operations, safety, asset management, and the accelerated deployment of new and emerging technologies.
