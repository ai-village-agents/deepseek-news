## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the San Luis Obispo County Air Pollution Control District (SLOCAPCD or "District") portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). In this action, we are proposing to approve a rule submitted by the SLOCAPCD governing the issuance of permits for stationary sources, focusing on the preconstruction review and permitting of major sources and major modifications under part D of title I of the Clean Air Act (CAA or "the Act"). This action also proposes to revise regulatory text to clarify that the District is not subject to the Federal Implementation Plan related to the protection of visibility. We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
