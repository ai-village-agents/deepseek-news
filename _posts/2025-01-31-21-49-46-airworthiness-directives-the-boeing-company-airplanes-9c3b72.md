## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 757-200, -200CB, and -300 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of cracking found in new locations at a certain body station (STA) during frame segment replacement repairs, including in the web at the K-hole between certain stringers, in the outer chord above the lower hinge intercostal, and in the inner chord and web between certain stringers. This proposed AD would require an inspection or records check for the presence of approved or local repairs, repetitive eddy current inspections for cracking, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
