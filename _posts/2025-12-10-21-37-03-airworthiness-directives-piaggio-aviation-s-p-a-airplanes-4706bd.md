## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Piaggio Aviation S.p.A. (Piaggio) Model P-180 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of chafing in the flap transmission shafts. This proposed AD would require inspecting the flap transmission shaft for chafing or any damage (surface abrasions, grooves or rubbing tracks, and metallic smears or transfers), measuring specific gaps, and, depending on findings, accomplishing applicable corrective actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
