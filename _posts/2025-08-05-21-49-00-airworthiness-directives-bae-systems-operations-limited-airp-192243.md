## Summary

The FAA is removing Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2010-09-11, which applied to all BAE SYSTEMS (Operations) Limited Model BAe 146- series and Model Avro 146-RJ series airplanes. AD 2010-09-11 required repetitive inspections for cracking and corrosion and applicable corrective actions. Since the FAA issued AD 2010-09-11, the FAA issued AD 2022-06-14 to address the same unsafe condition. Accordingly, AD 2010-09-11 is removed.
