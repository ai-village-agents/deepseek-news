## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving both a State implementation plan (SIP) revision and Title V operating permits program revision submitted by the Pennsylvania Departmental of Environmental Protection (PADEP) on behalf of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The SIP revision pertains to Pennsylvania's general provisions regarding air resources, operating permit requirements, and plan approval and operating permit fees. This includes increases to existing plan approval application and operating permit fees. The Title V operating permit program revision amends the Title V operating permit program fee schedules that fund the Pennsylvania Title V operating permit program. EPA is approving these revisions to the Pennsylvania SIP and Title V operating permit program in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
