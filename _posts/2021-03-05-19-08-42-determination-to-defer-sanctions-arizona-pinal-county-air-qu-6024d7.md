## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is making an interim final determination that the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) has submitted rules and other materials on behalf of the Pinal County Air Quality Control District (PCAQCD or District) that correct deficiencies in its Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) state implementation plan (SIP) provisions concerning ozone nonattainment requirements. This determination is based on a proposed approval, published elsewhere in this Federal Register, of PCAQCD's reasonably available control technology (RACT) SIP rules and negative declarations. The effect of this interim final determination is that the imposition of sanctions that were triggered by a previous partial disapproval and limited disapproval by the EPA in 2019 is now deferred. If the EPA finalizes its approval of PCAQCD's submission, relief from these sanctions will become permanent.
