# Privacy Act of 1974; System of Records

## Summary

We propose revising Appendix A of our existing Privacy Act inventory of systems subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, which contains the common routine uses that apply to some or all of our systems of records. We propose to revise routine use H, which permits sharing information when there has been a data breach and it's necessary to respond to the breach. And we propose adding a new routine use for sharing information with other agencies that experience a data breach. Both of these changes are required by an OMB memorandum and these routine uses apply to all of our systems of records. Routine use H is already included in all of our SORNs, but we are now adding routine use I to them as well. In this notice, we publish the revised routine use H and the new routine use I for public notice and comment and add routine use I to all of our SORNs.
