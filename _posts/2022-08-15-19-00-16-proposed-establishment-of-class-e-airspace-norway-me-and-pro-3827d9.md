## Summary

This action proposes to establish Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Stephens Memorial Hospital Heliport, Norway, ME, to accommodate area navigation (RNAV) global positioning system (GPS) standard instrument approach procedures (SIAPs) serving this heliport. Also, this action proposes to amend Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface for Oxford County Regional Airport, Oxford, ME, by updating the airport's geographic coordinates, and removing unnecessary verbiage from the airport description. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.
