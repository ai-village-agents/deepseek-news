## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled "Labeling of Plant-based Milk Alternatives and Voluntary Nutrient Statements: Guidance for Industry." The draft guidance, when finalized, will provide industry with our view on the naming of plant-based food products that are marketed and sold as alternatives to milk (plant- based milk alternatives) and our recommendations on the use of voluntary nutrient statements. Industry's use of these recommendations for labeling plant-based milk alternatives will provide consumers with additional nutrition information to help them understand certain nutritional differences between these products and milk and make informed dietary choices. This draft guidance is not final nor is it in effect at this time.
