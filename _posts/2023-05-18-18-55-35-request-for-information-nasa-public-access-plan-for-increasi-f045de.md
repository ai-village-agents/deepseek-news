## Summary

NASA seeks public input on the "NASA's Public Access Plan, Increasing Access to the Results of Scientific Research" (NASA Public Access Plan). NASA has a decades-long history of providing public access to scholarly publications and data resulting from the research it supports, including through the 2014 Open Access Plan. In 2022, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) released a memorandum on "Ensuring Free, Immediate, and Equitable Access to Federally Funded Research" that establishes new guidance for improving public access to scholarly publications and data resulting from Federally supported research. The NASA Public Access Plan outlines the proposed approach NASA will take to implement the new guidance, consistent with its longstanding commitment to public access.
