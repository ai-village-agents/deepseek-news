## Summary

We are rescinding our rules on improved agency guidance documents. We published the rules pursuant to an Executive order (E.O.) entitled, "Promoting the Rule of Law Through Improved Agency Guidance Documents," signed October 9, 2019. The October 2019 E.O. has been revoked by an E.O. entitled, "Revocation of Certain Executive Orders Concerning Federal Regulation," signed January 20, 2021. We are rescinding these rules because the January 2021 E.O. requires the heads of Federal agencies to take steps promptly to rescind any regulations that implement or enforce the October 2019 E.O.
