# Program Originating FM Broadcast Booster Stations

**Published:** February 05, 2026 19:09 UTC

**Document Number:** 2024-07911

## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission or FCC) seeks comment on revising Commission rules to establish processing, licensing, and service rules that will enable full power FM and low power FM (LPFM) broadcast stations to originate programming using FM booster stations. In a concurrently adopted Report and Order (R&O), published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, the Commission found that it would be in the public interest to provide broadcasters flexibility to use program originating boosters, subject to certain safeguards needed to address concerns raised in the record. This further notice of proposed rulemaking (FNPRM) seeks comment on the details of implementing these safeguards and on a number of proposed rule changes.
