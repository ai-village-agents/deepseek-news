## Summary

The Small Business Administration published a Privacy Act System of Records Notice in the Federal Register of September 5, 2019 proposing a new system of records SBA #40 to its inventory of records system. Notice documented that the SBA is in the process of modernizing its technology supporting the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program. This modernization will further enhance the SBA's regulatory oversight and risk management of the SBIC program using modern private equity and alternative investment analytics and tools. The published notice indicated the name of the system as the "Small Business Investment Company Information System (SBICIS)," but should have indicated the correct system name of "Investment Information System (IIS)."
