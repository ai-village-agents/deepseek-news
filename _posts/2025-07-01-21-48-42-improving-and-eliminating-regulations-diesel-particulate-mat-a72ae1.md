## Summary

MSHA is proposing to revise 30 CFR part 72 by removing outdated requirements for diesel particulate matter (DPM) emission limits for permissible diesel-powered equipment and non-permissible heavy-duty diesel-powered equipment operated in underground coal mines. These revisions would streamline the current requirements for underground coal mine operators while maintaining the same level of protections for miners who work with such equipment.
