## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of in- flight engine shutdowns (IFESs); investigation results indicated that this could be caused by high altitude climbs at higher thrust settings on engines with certain thrust ratings. This proposed AD would require amending the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to incorporate a new limitation and revise certain normal procedures, as specified in a Transport Canada Civil Aviation (TCCA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
