## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the Utah Division of Administrative Rules (DAR) submitted by the State of Utah on May 21, 2020, May 28, 2020, November 3, 2020, and November 12, 2020. The revisions to the Utah Administrative Code address various State Implementation Plan (SIP) changes and updates. Specifically, we are proposing to make clerical updates to the General Requirements, Permits, and Emissions Inventory rules, including updating the effective date of various code of federal regulations (CFR) referenced. Additionally, we are proposing to approve changes to several Permits rules including adding new definitions, clarifying testing methods, and specifying an emissions limit for particulate matter 2.5 (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) for emissions impact analysis. We are also proposing to repeal and replace the Emissions Testing rule as well as approve a new rule related to abrasive blasting in particular matter 10 (PM<INF>10</INF>) nonattainment areas. The EPA is taking this action pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA).
