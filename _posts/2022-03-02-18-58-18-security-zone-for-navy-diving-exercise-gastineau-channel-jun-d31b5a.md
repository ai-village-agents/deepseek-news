## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary security zone for certain waters of the Gastineau Channel. This action is necessary to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards created by a Navy diving exercise involving remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and accompanying divers on these navigable waters between the Juneau-Douglas Bridge and Savikko Park near Juneau, AK, from March 6, 2022, through March 17, 2022. This regulation prohibits persons and vessels from being in the security zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Southeast Alaska or a designated representative.
