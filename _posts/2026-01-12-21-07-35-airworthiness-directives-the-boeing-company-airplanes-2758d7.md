# Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 737-700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of cracks in the outward lower wing skin at the outboard end of a certain stringer. This proposed AD would require an inspection of the outboard lower wing skin on the left and right wing for any repair, repetitive inspections for cracking and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
