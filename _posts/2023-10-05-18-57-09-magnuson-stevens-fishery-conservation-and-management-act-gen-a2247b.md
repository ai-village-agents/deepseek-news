## Summary

During the June 2023 Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) meeting, the Council made several recommendations to NMFS regarding applications received in 2022 and 2023 for exempted fishing permits (EFPs). All EFP applicants request exemptions from regulatory provisions pertaining to the use of authorized gear types under the Fishery Management Plan for U.S. West Coast Fisheries for Highly Migratory Species (HMS FMP). The applicants propose to test the effects and efficacy of using alternative fishing practices to harvest swordfish and other HMS off of the U.S. West Coast. The applications include requests to fish with a range of gear configurations including modified standard and linked daytime deep-set buoy gear (DSBG), night- set buoy gear, and extended linked buoy gear. The Council reviewed these applications and made recommendations to NMFS at their June and September meetings in 2022 and 2023. NMFS has determined that these applications warrant further consideration and is requesting public comment on them.
