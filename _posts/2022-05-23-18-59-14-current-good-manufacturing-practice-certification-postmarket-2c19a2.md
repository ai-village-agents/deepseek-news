## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is proposing new regulations that would amend the requirements concerning current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) and postmarketing safety reporting that apply to certain medical gases. FDA further proposes to establish regulations regarding certification of designated medical gases and amend the labeling regulations that apply to certain medical gases. This action, if finalized, will clarify the regulatory obligations of entities that manufacture, process, pack, label, or distribute certain medical gases, as well as reduce regulatory burden in this area. This proposed rule is intended to establish requirements that are more specifically tailored to the medical gas industry.
