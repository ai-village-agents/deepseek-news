## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice announces the intention of the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) to request revision and extension of a currently approved information collection, the Mink Survey. The target population will be pulled from the NASS List Frame of operations with positive historical data. The frame is updated with the names of new operations that are found in trade magazines or grower's association's lists. The questionnaires that NASS is planning to use are the same as what was used in previous years. Any additional changes to the questionnaires would result from requests by industry data users.
