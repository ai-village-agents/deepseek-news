## Summary

The Small Business Administration (SBA) plans to seek approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to conduct the data collection activities described below. The Paperwork Reduction Act requires federal agencies to publish a notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of information to OMB, and to allow 60 days for the public to comment in response to the notice. This notice complies with such requirements and announces the SBA's proposal to conduct a survey of small business executives who participated in the SBA's T.H.R.I.V.E. Emerging Leaders Reimagined program.
