## Summary

G&K Automotive Conversion, Inc. (G&K or Petitioner) has petitioned NHTSA for a decision that model year 2017-2019 Mercedes-Benz Maybach S600 Pullman vehicles that were not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSS) are eligible for importation into the United States. In its petition, G&K claims that these vehicles are eligible for import because they are substantially similar to and of the same model year as vehicles originally manufactured for import into and certified for sale in the United States, and they are capable of being readily altered to conform to all applicable FMVSS. This document announces the denial of G&K's petition.
