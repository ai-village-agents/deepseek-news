# Airworthiness Directives; Bombardier, Inc., Airplanes

**Published:** February 04, 2026 21:49 UTC

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-2A12 (601) and CL-600-2B16 (601- 3A, 601-3R, and 604 Variants) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
