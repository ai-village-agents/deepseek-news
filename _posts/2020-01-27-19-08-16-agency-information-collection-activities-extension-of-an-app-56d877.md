## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FMCSA announces its plan to submit the Information Collection Request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review and approval and invites public comment. FMCSA requests approval to extend an existing ICR titled, "Transportation of Hazardous Materials, Highway Routing." The information reported by States, the District of Columbia, Indian tribes, and U.S. Territories is necessary to identify designated/restricted routes and restrictions or limitations affecting how motor carriers may transport certain hazardous materials on their highways, including dates that such routes were established and information on subsequent changes or new hazardous materials routing designations. FMCSA received one anonymous comment to the 60-day Federal Register Notice published on August 13, 2019. The comment was in support of the information collection.
