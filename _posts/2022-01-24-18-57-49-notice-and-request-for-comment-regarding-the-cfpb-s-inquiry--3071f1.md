## Summary

On December 16, 2021, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) opened market monitoring orders, inquiring into Buy-Now-Pay- Later (BNPL) products in the United States to gain information about the size, scope, and business practices of the BNPL market. The information will help the Bureau better understand how consumers interact with BNPL providers, and how BNPL business models impact the broader e-commerce and consumer credit marketplaces. The Bureau also issued a press release to accompany these orders. The Bureau invites any interested parties, including consumers, small businesses, consumer advocates, financial institutions, trade associations, investors, state and Federal regulators and Attorneys General, and experts in consumer lending, payments, and marketing to submit comments to inform the agency's inquiry.
