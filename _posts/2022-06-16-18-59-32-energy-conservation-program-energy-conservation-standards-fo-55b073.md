## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is initiating an effort to evaluate whether to establish energy conservation standards for a category of direct heating equipment ("DHE"), specifically consumer hearth heaters. This request for information ("RFI") solicits information from the public to help DOE determine whether potential standards for consumer hearth heaters would result in significant energy savings and whether such standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified. DOE welcomes written comments from the public on any subject within the scope of this document (including topics not specifically raised), as well as the submission of data and other relevant information.
