In accordance with the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA or the Act), notice is given of a proposed consent decree in United Refining Co. v. Wheeler, No. 20-cv-1956 (D.D.C.). On July 7, 2020, United Refining Co. (United) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) failed to perform a certain non- discretionary duty.
