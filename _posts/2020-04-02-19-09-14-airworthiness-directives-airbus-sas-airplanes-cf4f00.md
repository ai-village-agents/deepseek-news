## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A318, A319, A320, and A321 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a recent maintenance repair organization's report to Airbus of deviations from the component maintenance manual acceptance test procedure for certain trimmable horizontal stabilizer actuators (THSAs). This AD requires replacement of affected THSAs with serviceable THSAs, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
