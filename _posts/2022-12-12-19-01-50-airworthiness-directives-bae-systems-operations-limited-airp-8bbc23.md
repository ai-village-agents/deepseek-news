## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2005-06- 14, which applied to certain British Aerospace Model BAe 146 and Model Avro 146-RJ series airplanes. AD 2005-06-14 required repetitive inspections for cracking of the outer links on the main landing gear (MLG) side stays, and corrective actions if necessary. AD 2005-06-14 also provided an optional terminating action for the repetitive inspections. Since the FAA issued AD 2005-06-14, there has been a report of additional cracking on a MLG side stay on which the terminating action has been done. This AD continues to require the actions specified in AD 2005-06-14 and requires new repetitive inspections for cracking of the MLG side stay outer link and replacement if necessary as specified in a United Kingdom (U.K.) Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) (U.K. CAA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also prohibits the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
