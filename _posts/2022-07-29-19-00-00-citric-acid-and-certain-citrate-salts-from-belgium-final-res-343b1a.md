## Summary

On June 13, 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) published the notice of initiation and preliminary results of the changed circumstances review (CCR) of the antidumping duty (AD) order on citric acid and certain citrate salts (citric acid) from Belgium. Commerce preliminarily determined that Citribel nv (Citribel) is the successor-in-interest to S.A. Citrique Belge N.V. (Citrique Belge) and, as a result, should be accorded the same AD cash deposit treatment as Citrique Belge with respect to subject merchandise. For these final results, Commerce continues to find that Citribel is the successor-in- interest to Citrique Belge and is entitled to the same cash deposit treatment as Citrique Belge under the AD order on citric acid from Belgium.
