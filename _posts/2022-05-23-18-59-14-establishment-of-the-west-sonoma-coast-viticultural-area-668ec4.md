## Summary

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) establishes the approximately 141,846-acre "West Sonoma Coast" viticultural area in Sonoma County, California. The viticultural area lies entirely within the established Sonoma Coast and North Coast viticultural areas and contains the established Fort Ross-Seaview viticultural area. TTB designates viticultural areas to allow vintners to better describe the origin of their wines and to allow consumers to better identify wines they may purchase.
