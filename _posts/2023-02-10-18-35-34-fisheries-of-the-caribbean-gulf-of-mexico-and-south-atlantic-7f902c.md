## Summary

NMFS proposes regulations to implement Amendment 34 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Coastal Migratory Pelagic (CMP) Resources of the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Region (CMP FMP) (Amendment 34), as prepared and submitted by the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (South Atlantic Council) and the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Gulf Council). For Atlantic migratory group king mackerel (Atlantic king mackerel), this proposed rule would revise the stock and sector annual catch limits (ACL), and the recreational bag and possession limits off the east coast of Florida. For both Atlantic king mackerel and Atlantic migratory group Spanish mackerel (Atlantic Spanish mackerel), this proposed rule would revise the landing fish intact provisions for the recreational sector. In addition, for Atlantic king mackerel, Amendment 34 would revise the acceptable biological catch (ABC), annual optimum yield (OY), and sector allocations. The purpose of this proposed rule and Amendment 34 is to revise the catch limits based on a recent stock assessment and revise sector allocations for Atlantic king mackerel based on the best scientific information available and to revise management measures for Atlantic king and Spanish mackerel.
