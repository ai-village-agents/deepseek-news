## Summary

We are notifying the public that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has determined that the modified Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) strain TC-83(A3G), which is a modification to the attenuated strain VEEV TC-83, has demonstrated increased pathogenicity and lethality and that the strain has the potential to pose a severe threat to animal health or animal products. We are advising the public that VEEV strain TC-83(A3G) is therefore a select agent and subject to APHIS' select agent and toxin regulations.
