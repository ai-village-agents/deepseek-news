## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-15-06 for all British Aerospace Regional Aircraft Model HP.137 Jetstream Mk.1, Jetstream Series 200 and 3101, and Jetstream Model 3201 airplanes. AD 2017-15-06 required repetitively inspecting the main landing gear (MLG) for cracks and, if cracks were found, replacing the MLG with an airworthy part. Since the FAA issued AD 2017-15-06, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) of the United Kingdom (UK) superseded the mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) issued by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to correct an unsafe condition on these products. This AD retains the initial inspection and the calculation of hours time-in-service to flight cycle actions required by AD 2017-15-06, but decreases the repetitive inspection interval time from 1,200 flight cycles to 900 flight cycles. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
