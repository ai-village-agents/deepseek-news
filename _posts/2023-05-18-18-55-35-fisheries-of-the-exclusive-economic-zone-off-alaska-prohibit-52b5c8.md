## Summary

NMFS announces the renewal of two prohibited species donation (PSD) permits to SeaShare, a non-profit and tax exempt organization, authorizing this organization to distribute Pacific salmon and Pacific halibut to hunger relief agencies, food bank networks, or food bank distributors under the PSD program. Salmon and halibut are caught incidentally during directed fishing for groundfish with trawl gear off Alaska. This action is necessary to comply with provisions of the PSD program and is intended to promote the goals and objectives of the North Pacific Fishery Management Council.
