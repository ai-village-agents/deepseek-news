## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model AS332C, AS332C1, AS332L, and AS332L1 helicopters. This AD results from a report of the loss of the tail rotor pitch control due to a fracture of the tail rotor slide of the tail rotor head (TRH) assembly. This AD requires inspecting the slide of the control plate of the TRH assembly for any score, scratch, crack, or corrosion, removing corrosion and replacing the TRH assembly, slide of the control plate, or pitch control assembly if discrepancies are found, and reporting the results of the inspection. This AD prohibits installing an affected TRH assembly unless the actions of this AD are accomplished. All of these actions are specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
