## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to approve a revision to the Oregon State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted on September 5, 2019. The submission revises the SIP to incorporate by reference a more recent update to the emission standards for specific industries by defining the specific Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) edition referenced throughout the revised rule. The EPA is also proposing to make non-substantive revisions to the SIP to correct typographical errors. The EPA reviewed the submitted revision and proposes to find it consistent with Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements.
