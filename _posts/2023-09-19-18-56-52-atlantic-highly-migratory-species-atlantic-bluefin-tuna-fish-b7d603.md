## Summary

NMFS is transferring 21.7 metric tons (mt) of Atlantic bluefin tuna (BFT) quota from the Reserve category to the General category September time period resulting in an adjusted September time period subquota of 210 mt and a Reserve category quota of 5.7 mt. NMFS is also simultaneously closing the General category fishery for large medium and giant (i.e., measuring 73 inches (185 centimeters)) curved fork length or greater) BFT for the September time period. This action also waives the previously scheduled restricted-fishing days (RFDs) for the remainder of the September time period. With the RFDs waived during the closure, fishermen aboard General category permitted vessels and Highly Migratory Species (HMS) Charter/Headboat permitted vessels may tag and release BFT of all sizes, subject to the requirements of the catch-and- release and tag-and-release programs. On October 1, 2023, the fishery will reopen automatically and previously scheduled RFDs for October will resume.
