Aircraft Operators seeking specific operational approval to conduct Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) operations must submit application to the FAA. Specific approval is required when aircraft operators intend to operate outside the United States (U.S.) or their aircraft are not equipped with Automatic Dependent Surveillance--Broadcast (ADS-B) Out.
