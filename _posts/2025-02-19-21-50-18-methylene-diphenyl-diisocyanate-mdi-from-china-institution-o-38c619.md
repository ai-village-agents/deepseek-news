## Summary

The Commission hereby gives notice of the institution of an investigation and commencement of preliminary phase antidumping duty investigation No. 731-TA-1733 (Preliminary) pursuant to the Tariff Act of 1930 ("the Act") to determine whether there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is materially injured or threatened with material injury, or the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded, by reason of imports of methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI products) from China, provided for in subheadings 2929.10.80 and 3909.31.00. Subject merchandise may also be entered under subheadings 3506.91.50, 3815.90.50, 3824.99.29, 3824.99.93, 3909.50.50, 3911.90.45, 3920.99.50, and 3921.13.50 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, that are alleged to be sold in the United States at less than fair value.
