## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a clean data determination for the Anderson and Freestone Counties and the Titus County nonattainment areas, concluding that each area is currently in attainment of the 2010 1-hour Primary Sulfur Dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standard (SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS) per the EPA's Clean Data Policy. The primary sources of Sulfur Dioxide emissions in these counties have permanently shut down and air quality in these areas is now attaining the SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS. This final action is supported by EPA's evaluation of available monitoring data, emissions data, and air quality modeling. This action suspends the requirements for these areas to submit an attainment demonstration, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions related to attainment of the 2010 SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS until the area is formally redesignated, or a violation of the NAAQS occurs. This action is being taken in accordance with the Clean Air Act.
