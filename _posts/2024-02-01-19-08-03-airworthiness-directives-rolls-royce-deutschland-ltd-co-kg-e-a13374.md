## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Model Trent 1000-A, Trent 1000-AE, Trent 1000-C, Trent 1000-CE, Trent 1000-D, Trent 1000-E, Trent 1000-G, and Trent 1000-H engines. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of cracking and separation of certain low-pressure turbine (LPT) stage 1 blade assemblies. This proposed AD would require initial and repetitive inspections of affected LPT stage 1 blade assemblies for cracking or separation and, depending on the results of the inspections, reduction of the inspection interval or replacement of the LPT stage 1 blade set and disk. This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of an LPT disk or blade set assembly unless it is considered a serviceable part, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
