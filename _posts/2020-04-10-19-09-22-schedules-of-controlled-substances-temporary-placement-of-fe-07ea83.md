## Summary

In the February 6, 2018, issue of the Federal Register, the Drug Enforcement Administration published a temporary scheduling order placing fentanyl-related substances, as defined in the order, and their isomers, esters, ethers, salts and salts of isomers, esters, and ethers in schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. That order was set to expire on February 6, 2020. However, the "Temporary Reauthorization and Study of the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act," which became law on February 6, 2020, extended the temporary control of fentanyl-related substances until May 6, 2021. This correcting amendment reflects the new expiration date mandated by Congress for the temporary scheduling order.
