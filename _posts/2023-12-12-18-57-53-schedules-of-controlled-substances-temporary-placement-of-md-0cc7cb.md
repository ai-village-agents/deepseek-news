## Summary

The Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration is issuing this temporary order to schedule six synthetic cannabinoids and their optical and geometric isomers, salts, and salts of isomers, whenever the existence of such isomers and salts is possible, in schedule I under the Controlled Substances Act. This action is based on a finding by the Administrator that the placement of these six substances in schedule I is necessary to avoid imminent hazard to the public safety. As a result of this order, the regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions applicable to schedule I controlled substances on persons who handle (manufacture, distribute, reverse distribute, import, export, engage in research, conduct instructional activities or chemical analysis with, or possess) or propose to handle these six specified controlled substances.
