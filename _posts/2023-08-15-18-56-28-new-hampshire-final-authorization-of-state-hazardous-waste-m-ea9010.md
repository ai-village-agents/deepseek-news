## Summary

New Hampshire has applied to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended. The EPA has reviewed New Hampshire's application and has determined that these revisions satisfy all requirements needed to qualify for final authorization. Therefore, we are taking direct final action to authorize the State's changes. In the "Proposed Rules" section of this issue of the Federal Register, the EPA is also publishing a separate document that serves as the proposal to authorize these revisions. Unless the EPA receives written comments that oppose this authorization during the comment period, the decision to authorize New Hampshire's revisions to its hazardous waste program will take effect.
