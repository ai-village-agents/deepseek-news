## Summary

This final rule amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regulations to reflect the imposition of emergency import restrictions on certain archaeological and ethnological material from the Republic of Yemen (Yemen). The Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States Department of State, has determined that conditions warrant the imposition of emergency restrictions on categories of archaeological material and ethnological material of the Islamic cultural heritage of Yemen. This document contains the Designated List of Archaeological and Ethnological Material of Yemen that describes the types of objects or categories of archaeological and ethnological material to which the import restrictions apply. The emergency import restrictions imposed on certain archaeological and ethnological material from Yemen will be in effect for a five-year period from the date on which Yemen requested that such restrictions be imposed, until September 11, 2024, unless renewed. These restrictions are being imposed pursuant to determinations of the United States Department of State made under the terms of the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act.
