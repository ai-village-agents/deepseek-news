## Summary

This document amends Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) Nos. 122 and 123 to allow the use of an internationally recognized symbol. It also relocates the telltale specifications for anti-lock braking system (ABS) malfunction from FMVSS No. 101 to the appropriate table in FMVSS No. 123 since the latter applies to motorcycles. In addition, this final rule makes two technical corrections: It corrects motorcycle category references in S6.3.2 of FMVSS No. 122 and an outdated table reference found in FMVSS No. 135.
