## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License Nos. NPF-91 and NPF-92, issued to Southern Nuclear Operating Company, for the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP), Units 3 and 4. The proposed amendment requests changes to the VEGP Units 3 and 4 Cyber Security Plan (CSP) to identify the VEGP Units 1 and 2 CSP for cyber security protection of digital assets in common systems, to align language in the VEGP Units 3 and 4 CSP with the corresponding elements of the NRC-endorsed CSP template contained in Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) 08-09, Revision 6, including Addendum 1, and to enhance certain controls for the VEGP Units 3 and 4 protection and safety monitoring system. For this amendment request, the NRC proposes to determine that it involves no significant hazards consideration. Because this amendment request contains sensitive unclassified non-safeguards information (SUNSI), an order imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI for contention preparation.
