## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to list the Borneo earless monitor (Lanthanotus borneensis), a lizard species from Borneo, as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). This determination also serves as our 12-month finding on a petition to list the Borneo earless monitor. After a review of the best scientific and commercial data available, we find that listing the species is warranted. Accordingly, we propose to list the Borneo earless monitor as a threatened species with protective regulations under section 4(d) of the Act ("4(d) rule"). If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would add this species to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and extend the Act's protections to the species.
