## Summary

On January 17, 2025, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) published an interim final rule in the Federal Register amending the CBP regulations to add implementing regulations for the preferential tariff treatment and related customs provisions of the Agreement Between the United States of America, the United Mexican States, and Canada (USMCA) related to general definitions, drawback and duty- deferral programs, textile and apparel goods, and automotive goods, among others. Errant amendatory instructions resulted in the inadvertent omission of two conforming amendments and the removal of two paragraphs that were unrelated to the USMCA amendments. This action corrects those errors.
