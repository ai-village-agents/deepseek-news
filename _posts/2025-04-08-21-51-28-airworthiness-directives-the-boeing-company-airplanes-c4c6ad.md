## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-09- 06, which applied to all The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER series airplanes. AD 2021-09-06 required repetitive inspections for cracking of the left- and right-hand outboard chords of certain frame fittings and failsafe straps at a certain station around eight fasteners, and repair if any cracking is found. This AD was prompted by additional reports of cracking in the area and a subsequent determination that additional inspections are needed to address the unsafe condition. This AD requires repetitive detailed and ultrasonic inspections for cracking of the left- and right-hand sides of certain frame fittings and failsafe straps, and repair if any cracking is found. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
