## Summary

The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) establishes six primary indicators of performance for certain WIOA- authorized programs and defines five of the six performance indicators. The U.S. Departments of Labor and Education (the Departments) published a final rule under RIN 1205-AC01 to define the sixth performance indicator--effectiveness in serving employers--as Retention with Same Employer into the implementing regulations for the six WIOA core programs. In this related final rule, the Department of Labor (DOL or the Department) is incorporating the same definition of the ESE performance indicator into regulations for the following WIOA title I non-core programs: the Indian and Native American (INA), the Job Corps, and the YouthBuild program. This final rule makes two changes from the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for the WIOA title I non-core programs: the final rule permits the use of supplemental wage information in the definition of the effectiveness in serving employers performance indicator, and it specifies that the definition is measuring retention in unsubsidized employment.
