## Summary

On March 30, 2020, President Trump issued a memorandum to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) directing him to extend the Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) wind-down period for eligible Liberians, and to provide for continued work authorization through January 10, 2021, after which date the DED wind-down period will end. Furthermore, Liberians who apply for adjustment of status under the Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness (LRIF) provision of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 on or before December 20, 2020 may immediately apply for employment authorization consistent with that provision. During this extended DED wind down period and the LRIF application period, Liberians covered under DED may remain in the United States. Liberians covered under DED who also qualify to apply for permanent resident status under LRIF may experience a gap in employment authorization after the March 30, 2020 expiration of their current DED-based employment authorization documents (EADs). Therefore, the President directed that aliens who remain covered under DED be authorized employment for the duration of the extended DED wind-down period. This notice extends through January 10, 2021 employment authorization for Liberians (and persons without nationality who last habitually resided in Liberia) covered under DED who would like to apply for an EAD and also automatically extends DED-related EADs for those who already have an EAD with a printed expiration date of March 30, 2020.
