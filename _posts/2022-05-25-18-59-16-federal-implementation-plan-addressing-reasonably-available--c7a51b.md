## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing a Federal implementation plan (FIP) for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania or the Commonwealth). This FIP proposes to set emission limits for nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) emitted from coal-fired electric generating units (EGUs) equipped with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) in order to meet the reasonably available control technology (RACT) requirements for the 1997 and 2008 ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). The FIP is being proposed to ensure that EPA can, if necessary, meet a court-ordered deadline requiring EPA to approve an amended State Implementation Plan (SIP) or issue a FIP by August 27, 2022. This action is being taken under the Clean Air Act (CAA).
