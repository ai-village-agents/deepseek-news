## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all General Electric Company (GE) GE Passport 20-17BB1A, GE Passport 20- 18BB1A, and GE Passport 20-19BB1A model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by fuel leakage from the fuel nozzle to fuel manifold coupling nut connections. This AD requires a visual inspection of the core compartment, a re-torque of the core compartment coupling nuts, a ground power assurance check, and a borescope inspection. Depending on the results of the inspections, this AD requires operators to perform applicable maintenance in accordance with their FAA-approved instructions for continued airworthiness. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
