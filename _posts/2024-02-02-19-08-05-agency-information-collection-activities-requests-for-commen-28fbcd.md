## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for a new information collection. The collection involves conducting research in the form of interviews with aviation stakeholders (e.g., airport/droneport operators, private entities, original equipment manufacturers, unmanned aircraft system (UAS) industry vendors, academia, representatives of the military, aviation stakeholders, etc.) to catalog current and planned droneport planning, design, and infrastructure needs, as well as find out which airports are integrating UAS into the airport environment. During each interview, the FAA will ask the stakeholders a specific set of questions, and if necessary, fact-specific follow-up questions will be posed to clarify and enhance the respondent's answers to the specified set of questions. The information to be collected is necessary because it will allow the FAA to understand how aviation stakeholders are integrating UAS into existing airport design standards/infrastructure and standalone facilities also referred to as droneports. Currently, no formal FAA definition of droneport currently exists. Based on the results of this research effort, the FAA may develop a formal definition for a droneport. For the purposes of this research effort, a modified version of the 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 1 definition of `airport' is used to define droneport: `an area of land or water that is used or intended to be used for the landing and takeoff of UAS aircraft, and includes its buildings and facilities, if any.' The information collected will also be used to help the FAA to shape future droneport research efforts and possible standards and guidance material.
