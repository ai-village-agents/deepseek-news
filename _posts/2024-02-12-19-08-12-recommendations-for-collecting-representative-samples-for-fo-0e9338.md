## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled "Recommendations for Collecting Representative Samples for Food Testing Used as Evidence for Release of Certain Fish and Fishery Products Subject to Detention Without Physical Examination (DWPE) and Removal of a Foreign Manufacturer's Goods from DWPE." The draft guidance, when finalized, will provide recommendations for collecting a representative sample for products subject to DWPE under an import alert due to the appearance of adulteration caused by pathogens, unlawful animal drugs, scombrotoxin (histamine), and/or decomposition. When finalized, the draft guidance will also help foreign manufacturers and other processors of fish and fishery products subject to DWPE introduce evidence to FDA to support a request to have products removed from DWPE.
