## Summary

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission or CPSC) has two mandatory rules that incorporate by reference applicable provisions of ASTM F406-19, Standard Consumer Safety Specification for Non-Full-Size Baby Cribs/Play Yards. These mandatory rules are: (1) Safety Standard for Non-Full-Size Baby Cribs, and (2) Safety Standard for Play Yards. The Commission received notice from ASTM International that it has revised ASTM F406-19. CPSC seeks comment on whether the revised voluntary standard, ASTM F406-22, improves the safety of the consumer products covered by the standard.
