## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to amend the special local regulations and annual recurring marine events requiring safety zones for fireworks displays and swim events along the Coast Guard Sector Long Island Sound Captain of the Port Zone. When enforced, these special local regulations and safety zones restrict vessels from transiting regulated areas during certain annually recurring events. The proposed amendments to the special local regulations and safety zones are intended to expedite public notification and ensure the protection of the maritime public and event participants from the hazards associated with certain marine events. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
