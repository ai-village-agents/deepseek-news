## Summary

The Maritime Administration (MARAD) invites public comments on our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The information collection is necessary for MARAD to determine whether the applicant is committed to the redevelopment plan; the plan is in the best interests of the public, and the property will be used in accordance with the terms of the conveyance and applicable statutes and regulations. We are required to publish this notice in the Federal Register by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
