## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), this notice announces the Agricultural Marketing Service's (AMS) intention to request approval, from the Office of Management and Budget, for an information collection package for the web form to be used for the collection of complaints and tips from the public through the FarmerFairness.gov web portal. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) launched a web portal to allow farmers, ranchers and interested persons to report a complaint or submit information regarding potential violations of the Packers and Stockyards (P&S) Act or other federal anti-trust laws. USDA and DOJ will assess information collected to determine appropriate jurisdiction and any follow up actions. The joint USDA/DOJ web portal, FarmerFairness.gov, is subject to the reporting and recordkeeping requirements under the P&S Act.
