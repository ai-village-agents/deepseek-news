## Summary

NMFS is adjusting the Atlantic bluefin tuna (BFT) Purse Seine and Reserve category quotas for 2021, as it has done annually since 2015. NMFS also is transferring 26 metric tons (mt) of BFT quota from the Reserve category to the General category January 2021 subquota period (from January 1 through March 31, 2021, or until the available subquota for this period is reached, whichever comes first). The transfer to the General category is based on consideration of the regulatory determination criteria regarding inseason adjustments and applies to Atlantic tunas General category (commercial) permitted vessels and Highly Migratory Species (HMS) Charter/Headboat category permitted vessels with a commercial sale endorsement when fishing commercially for BFT.
