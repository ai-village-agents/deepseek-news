# Privacy Act Regulations for EPA-83

**Published:** February 05, 2026 18:57 UTC

## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is proposing to revise the Agency's Privacy Act regulations to exempt a system of records, EPA-83, the Personnel Security System (PSS) 2.0, from certain requirements of the Privacy Act because the system will contain information relevant to insider threat inquiries and background investigations. If such information is not kept confidential, it could jeopardize EPA or a referring agency's ability to conduct background investigations, insider threat inquiries, or any related inquiries. In the "Rules and Regulations" section of this Federal Register, EPA is simultaneously publishing the revision of the Agency's Privacy Act Regulations to include EPA-83 as a direct final rule without a prior proposed rule. If the Agency receives no adverse comment, it will not take further action on this proposed rule.
