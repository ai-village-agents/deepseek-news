## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission or Agency) proposes to add a new system of records, FCC/WCB-4, Consumer Challenge Process, to its inventory of records systems subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. This action is necessary to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act to publish in the Federal Register notice of the existence and character of records maintained by the Agency. The FCC maintains programs that require telecommunication providers and carriers (Participants) to report service coverage or locations eligible for support to the FCC, such as the FCC's Digital Opportunity Data Collection (DODC) and the Universal Service Fund (USF) Eligible Location Adjustment Process (ELAP). Under these programs, consumers and third parties (collectively, Stakeholders) may challenge the service coverage or number of locations eligible for support (eligible locations) reported by Participants. The Consumer Challenge Process system of records contains personally identifiable information (PII) submitted by individuals, or third parties on behalf of individuals, needed to establish eligibility to challenge the accuracy of Participants' submissions, provide sufficient information for Participants to respond to a challenge, and create accurate maps of Participant coverage or eligible locations. To establish eligibility, prospective Stakeholders who are individuals must submit certain PII that will be used to verify their identities and their interest in receiving services from a Participant in the relevant geographic area, i.e., the coverage area for DODC, or the Participant's supported areas for ELAP. In certain programs, the PII will also be used to establish that the Stakeholders do not hold a controlling interest in a competitor. Once verified, Stakeholders may submit additional PII to establish that specific geolocations are eligible locations, such as evidence verifying ownership or occupancy of a location. Participation in any Consumer Challenge Process is voluntary.
