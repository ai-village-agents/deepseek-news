## Summary

The Farm Service Agency (FSA) amends the Farm Loan Programs (FLP) regulations to implement certain provisions authorized by the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (2018 Farm Bill). This rule revises the provisions on FLP loan limits, allows additional flexibility for loan applicants to meet the required farming experience, provides higher guarantee rates for lenders to provide credit to beginning farmers and socially disadvantaged farmers, provides additional program benefits for veterans, provides equitable relief to certain borrowers, allows borrowers who have received debt restructuring with a write down to receive Emergency loans (EM), and expands those issues that are covered under the agricultural Certified Mediation Program. In addition to the 2018 Farm Bill changes, FSA also amends the regulations for loan servicing relating to accepting cash payments and establishing a fee for dishonored checks; these are discretionary changes. The result of these changes will increase loan limits or improve the various loan programs to relieve some restrictions to participation or otherwise encourage participation. This rule also revises the way FSA will establish the maximum interest rates in response to the discontinuing publication of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) interest rates. The result of these changes will enable FSA to provide clearer guidance on maximum interest rates and allow for more consistency across all lenders participating in the guaranteed loan program. In addition, this rule corrects references to supervised credit in the regulations.
