## Summary

On December 23, 2022, the President signed into law the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (FY 2023 NDAA). Pursuant to the FY 2023 NDAA, this final rule establishes shore leave regulations for NOAA's professional mariners and authorizes payment of the difference between a NOAA professional mariner's temporary and permanent rates of pay for annual leave accrued while temporarily promoted. This final rule also makes clerical amendments to create a new subchapter specific to NOAA Marine and Aviation Operations.
