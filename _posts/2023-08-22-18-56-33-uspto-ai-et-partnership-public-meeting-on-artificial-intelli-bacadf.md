## Summary

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) plays an important role in incentivizing and protecting innovation, including innovation driven by artificial intelligence (AI), a transformative technology that holds promise for tremendous societal and economic benefit. The USPTO embraces an expansive view of the potential of AI and other emerging technologies (ET) as tools to be leveraged for advancing equitable access to the intellectual property (IP) system, improving agency operations, and enhancing employee effectiveness. Development and implementation of AI-enabled tools at the USPTO advances national priorities in IP to protect and promote inclusive, transparent, and trustworthy innovation. The USPTO will host a public meeting on AI tools and data virtually and in person at the USPTO headquarters on September 27, 2023, at 10:30 a.m. ET. This will be the fourth meeting in the USPTO's AI/ET Partnership Series. First announced in June 2022, the AI/ET Partnership provides an opportunity to bring stakeholders together through a series of engagements to share ideas, feedback, experiences, and insights on the intersection of IP and AI/ ET.
