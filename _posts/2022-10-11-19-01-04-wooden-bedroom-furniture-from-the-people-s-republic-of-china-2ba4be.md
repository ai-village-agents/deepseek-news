## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily determines that of the 33 companies/company groupings under review, nine of the companies/company groupings have not established their entitlement to a separate rate and are part of the People's Republic of China (China)-wide entity; seven companies/company groupings had no reviewable sales of wooden bedroom furniture (WBF) during the period of review (POR) January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2021; and all requests to review the remaining 17 companies/company groupings were timely withdrawn (thus, Commerce is rescinding this review with respect to these entities). We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results of review.
