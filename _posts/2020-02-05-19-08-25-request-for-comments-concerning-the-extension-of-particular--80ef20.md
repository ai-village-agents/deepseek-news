Effective July 6, 2018, the U.S. Trade Representative imposed additional duties on goods of China with an annual trade value of approximately $34 billion as part of the action in the Section 301 investigation of China's acts, policies, and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation. The U.S. Trade Representative initiated the exclusion process in July 2018 and has granted multiple sets of exclusions. The third set of exclusions was granted in April 2019, and is scheduled to expire on April 18, 2020. The U.S. Trade Representative has decided to consider a possible extension for up to 12 months of particular exclusions granted in April 2019. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) invites public comment on whether to extend particular exclusions.
