## Summary

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) proposes to hold Gulf of Mexico Wind Lease Sale (GOMW-2) for multiple lease areas (Lease Areas) using a multiple-factor bidding auction format. BOEM will use new auction software for the lease sale, resulting in changes to its previous auction rules. This Proposed Sale Notice (PSN) contains information pertaining to the areas available for leasing, certain lease provisions and conditions, auction details, lease forms, criteria for evaluating competing bids, award procedures, appeal procedures, and lease execution procedures. The issuance of any lease resulting from this sale would not constitute approval of project-specific plans to develop offshore wind energy. Such plans, if submitted by the Lessee, would be subject to subsequent environmental, technical, and public reviews prior to a BOEM decision whether or not to approve them.
