## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving elements of a State Implementation Plan (SIP) submission from the State of Oklahoma for the 2015 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) and disapproving elements of two SIP submissions for the 2010 sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) and the 2012 fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) NAAQS. These infrastructure SIP (i-SIP) submissions address how the existing SIP provides for implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of these NAAQS. The i-SIP requirements are to ensure that the Oklahoma SIP is adequate to meet the State's responsibilities under the CAA for these NAAQS. Specifically, this final rule addresses the interstate visibility transport requirements of the i-SIP for the 2015 Ozone NAAQS, 2010 SO<INF>2</INF>, and 2012 PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS under CAA section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(II). We are also finalizing our determination that the deficiencies in the Oklahoma SIP that form the basis of our disapproval of the interstate visibility transport portions of the Oklahoma i-SIP submissions for the 2010 SO<INF>2</INF> and 2012 PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS are remedied by the existing Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) in place for the Oklahoma Regional Haze program, and that no further Federal action is required to address the disapproval.
