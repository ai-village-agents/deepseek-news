The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) plans to hold comment-gathering public meetings on a proposed rule to amend its environmental protection regulations by updating the Commission's 2013 findings on the environmental effect of renewing the operating license of a nuclear power plant. The purpose of the meetings is to provide information and receive public comments on the proposed changes to NRC regulations, draft Revision 2 to NUREG-1437, "Generic Environmental Impact Statement for License Renewal of Nuclear Plants" (LR GEIS), and associated guidance.
