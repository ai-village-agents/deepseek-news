## Summary

To address the risk of strangulation to young children associated with certain window covering cords, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is proposing a rule to deem that one or more of the following readily observable characteristics of window coverings present a substantial product hazard (SPH) under the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA): The presence of hazardous operating cords on stock window coverings, the presence of hazardous inner cords on stock and custom window coverings, or the absence of a manufacturer label on stock and custom window coverings. The proposed rule would amend the Substantial Product Hazard List, which lists products that the Commission has determined present an SPH if the products have or lack specified characteristics that are readily observable, the hazards have been addressed by a voluntary standard, the voluntary standard has been effective in reducing the risk of injury associated with the product, and the products substantially comply with the voluntary standard.
