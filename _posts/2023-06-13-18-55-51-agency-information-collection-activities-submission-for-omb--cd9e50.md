## Summary

In accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), the OCC, the Board, and the FDIC (the agencies) may not conduct or sponsor, and a respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. On February 21, 2023, the agencies, under the auspices of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), requested public comment for 60 days on a proposal to revise and extend the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Reports) (FFIEC 031, FFIEC 041, and FFIEC 051), and the Report of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks (FFIEC 002), all of which are currently approved collections of information. These proposed revisions to the Call Reports and the FFIEC 002 result from the 2022 statutorily mandated review of the Call Reports, Call Report process revisions, and reporting of certain Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and similar securitizations.
