# Pacific Island Fisheries; Annual Catch Limits and Accountability Measures for Main Hawaiian Islands Kona Crab for Fishing Years 2024-2026

## Summary

NMFS proposes to implement an annual catch limit (ACL) and an annual catch target (ACT) for main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) Kona crab for fishing years 2024, 2025, and 2026. This proposed action would not revise, add, or remove current accountability measures (AMs) in the regulations. NMFS will close Federal waters to Kona crab fishing for the remainder of the fishing year if NMFS projects the fishery will reach the ACT. NMFS will reduce the ACT and ACL the subsequent fishing year by the overage if landings exceed the ACL. This proposed rule supports the long-term sustainability of MHI Kona crab.
