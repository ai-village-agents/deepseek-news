## Summary

This proposed rule would amend the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) regulations to incorporate three provisions of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 by adding to the program purpose language assisting low-income adults in obtaining employment and increasing their earnings; updating and defining the exceptions from the able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWD) time limit; and adjusting the number of discretionary exemptions available to State agencies each year. This proposed rule would also amend the regulations to clarify procedures for how and when State agencies must screen for exceptions to the time limit and clarify the verification requirements.
