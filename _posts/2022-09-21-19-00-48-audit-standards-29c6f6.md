## Summary

The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) is amending its Audit standards regulations. The amendments eliminate the Commission waiver requirement for reviewed financial statements and allow all operations grossing less than $2 million in the previous fiscal year to submit reviewed financial statements provided that the tribe or tribal gaming regulatory authority (TGRA) permits the gaming operation to submit reviewed financials. The amendments also create a third tier of financial reporting for charitable gaming operations with annual gross revenues of $50,000 or less where, if permitted by the tribe, a tribal or charitable gaming operation may submit financial information on a monthly basis to the tribe or the TGRA and in turn, the tribe or TGRA provides an annual certification to the NIGC regarding the gaming operation's compliance with the financial reporting requirements. The amendments also add a provision clarifying that the submission of an adverse opinion does not satisfy the regulation's reporting requirements.
