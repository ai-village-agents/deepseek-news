## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff has received an application from Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc. (NFS or the licensee) to amend special nuclear materials (SNM) license number SNM- 124. The amended license would authorize the licensee to perform uranium purification and conversion services at the NFS site pursuant to a contract with the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). Because the amendment request contains sensitive unclassified non-safeguards information (SUNSI), an order imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI for contention preparation by persons who file a hearing request or petition for leave to intervene.
