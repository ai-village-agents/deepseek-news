## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, make available a draft low-effect screening form for a categorical exclusion (dCatEx form) under the National Environmental Policy Act and candidate conservation agreement with assurances (CCAA) for normal agricultural operations, recreation, and nature tourism in Montague, Clay, Wichita, Archer, Wilbarger, Baylor, Hardeman, Foard, Childress, Cottle, and Motley Counties, in Texas. Texas Parks & Wildlife Department has applied for an enhancement of survival permit (EOS) under the Endangered Species Act that would authorize incidental take of the Texas kangaroo rat. The dCatEx form evaluates the impacts of, and alternatives to, implementation of the proposed CCAA. We seek public comment on the CCAA, dCatEx form, and EOS application.
