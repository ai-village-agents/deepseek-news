## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 777-200 and -300 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of three incidents involving in-flight fan blade failures on certain Pratt & Whitney engines ("fan blades" are also known as "1st-stage low- pressure compressor (LPC) blades"--these terms are used interchangeably in this AD). This AD requires modifying the engine inlet to withstand fan blade failure event loads. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
