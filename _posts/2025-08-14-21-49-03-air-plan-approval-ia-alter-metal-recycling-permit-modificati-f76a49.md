## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve revisions to the Iowa State Implementation Plan (SIP) to include a permit modification for Alter Metal Recycling. This final action will amend the SIP to incorporate revisions to the air construction permit for Alter Metal Recycling included in the State's 2008 Lead (Pb) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) attainment plan for a portion of Council Bluffs, Pottawattamie County, IA. These revisions do not impact the stringency of the SIP or have an adverse effect on air quality. The EPA's approval of this revision is being done in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
