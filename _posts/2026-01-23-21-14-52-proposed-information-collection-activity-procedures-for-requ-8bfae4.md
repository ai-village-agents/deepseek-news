## Summary

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is proposing to resume collecting data for the Procedures for Requests from Tribal Lead Agencies to use Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) Funds for Construction or Major Renovation of Child Care Facilities. This information collection was previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget. The Office of Child Care (OCC) is proposing to extend approval of the information collection with changes, significantly reducing the burden for Tribal Lead Agencies and clarifying requirements.
