## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) are amending Chobani, LLC's temporary permit to market test lower-fat yogurt products. The temporary permit is amended to allow the use of the test product as an ingredient in other nonstandardized food applications including drinkable beverages, dips, and sauces. This amendment will allow the applicant to continue to test market the test product, as ingredients, in whole or in part, in other nonstandardized foods and collect data on consumer acceptance of the test product.
