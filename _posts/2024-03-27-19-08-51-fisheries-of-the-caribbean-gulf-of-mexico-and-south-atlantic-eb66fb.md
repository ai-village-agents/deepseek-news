## Summary

NMFS implements an accountability measure (AM) for the commercial harvest of gag in South Atlantic Federal waters. NMFS has determined that commercial landings of gag exceeded the commercial annual catch limit (ACL) in 2023, and other triggers for the commercial AMs are met. Therefore, NMFS reduces the commercial ACL of gag in the 2024 fishing year by the amount of gag landings that exceeded the 2023 commercial ACL to protect the gag resource from overfishing and continue to allow the recovery of this overfished stock.
