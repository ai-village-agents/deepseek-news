## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-2A12 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of insufficient clearance between the surrounding structure/skin of the aircraft and select bleed air ducts that supply the wing ice protection system (WIPS) in the rear fuselage. This proposed AD would require inspecting the bleed air duct and surrounding structure for minimum clearance and damage, and applicable corrective actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
