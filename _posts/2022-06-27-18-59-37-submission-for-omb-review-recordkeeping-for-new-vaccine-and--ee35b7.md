## Summary

The Office of Head Start (OHS), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) requests public comment on an extension with no changes to recordkeeping requirements for ACF Head Start grantees. An Interim Final Rule with Comment Period (IFC) was published on November 30, 2021 that established the COVID-19 vaccination requirements whereby all Head Start staff, certain contractors, and volunteers must be vaccinated for COVID-19 by January 31, 2022. OHS requested and received emergency approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to implement the associated recordkeeping requirements for 6 months. This request will extend approval beyond the current expiration date (6/30/2022). ACF is currently in the final rulemaking process. If the requirements in the final rule differ from the IFC in a way that alters recordkeeping requirements, ACF will make those changes in coordination with OMB.
