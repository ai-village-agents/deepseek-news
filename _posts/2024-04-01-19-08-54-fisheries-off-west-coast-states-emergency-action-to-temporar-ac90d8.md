## Summary

This emergency rule temporarily modifies a continuous transit requirement for California recreational vessels. This modification will temporarily allow recreational vessels to anchor overnight and/or stop to fish for non-groundfish species inside the seasonal Recreational Rockfish Conservation Area off the coast of California, also known as the 50-fathom (91-meter) offshore fishery. This emergency measure will prevent the possible cancellation of thousands of recreational fishing trips during the 2024 recreational fishing season off California.
