## Summary

As a result of the determinations by the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) orders on stainless steel plate in coils (SSPC) from Belgium, South Africa, and Taiwan, and the countervailing duty (CVD) order on SSPC from South Africa would likely lead to a continuation or recurrence of dumping, net countervailable subsidies, and material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation of the AD orders and the CVD order.
