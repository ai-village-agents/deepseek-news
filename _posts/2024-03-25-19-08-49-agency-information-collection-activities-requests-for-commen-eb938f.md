## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. This collection involves two distinct methods of collecting. The first method of collecting uses the traditional paper/ hardcopy forms which is limited in scope. The second method is more expansive and uses online web-based forms or Application Programming Interface (API) upload functionality. The information can then be shared with a potential employer to aid them in their hiring decision- making process. The information collected can be release to a hiring employer by the pilot. Disclosure of their information is not possible unless the pilot first authorizes the release. The information to be collected will be used to and/or is necessary because before allowing an individual to begin service as a pilot, and air carrier or operator shall receive and evaluate all relevant information pertaining to the individual.
