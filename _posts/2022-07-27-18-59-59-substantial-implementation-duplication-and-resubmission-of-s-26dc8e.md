## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") is proposing to update certain substantive bases for exclusion of shareholder proposals under the Commission's shareholder proposal rule. The proposed amendments would amend the substantial implementation exclusion to specify that a proposal may be excluded if the company has already implemented the essential elements of the proposal. We also propose to specify when a proposal substantially duplicates another proposal for purposes of the duplication exclusion. In addition, we propose to amend the resubmission exclusion to provide that a proposal constitutes a resubmission if it substantially duplicates another proposal. Under the proposed amendments, for purposes of both the duplication exclusion and the resubmission exclusion, a proposal would substantially duplicate another proposal if it addresses the same subject matter and seeks the same objective by the same means.
