## Summary

The Corporation for National and Community Service (operating as AmeriCorps) proposes to revise its National Service Trust regulations. The National Service Trust is an account from which AmeriCorps pays education awards to eligible AmeriCorps participants and interest on qualified student loans for AmeriCorps participants during their terms of service in approved national service positions. This proposed rule would improve the clarity of regulations applicable to education awards through use of consistent terminology and more transparent procedures for extensions, transfers, and revocations of education awards, and would increase flexibility for those who earn education awards to use and transfer those awards. This proposed rule would also renumber sections related to national service education awards to combine them all into one CFR part with subpart designations for easier navigation.
