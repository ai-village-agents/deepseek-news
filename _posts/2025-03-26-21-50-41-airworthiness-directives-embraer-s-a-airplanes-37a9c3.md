## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Embraer S.A. Model EMB-545 and EMB-550 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a jamming failure of the main door lock sensor. This proposed AD would require repetitive main door sensor operational tests, repetitive lubrication of the main door sensor mechanism, and on-condition actions, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
