## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is correcting a document that was published in the Federal Register on September 12, 2022, regarding changes to maintain a consistent regulatory framework with the U.S. Department of Transportation for the domestic packaging and transportation of radioactive material and to ensure general accord with International Atomic Energy Agency standards. This action is necessary to make corrections in the estimated burden for the information collection and to make other corrections. The public comment period on the amended information collection was originally scheduled to close on November 14, 2022. The NRC has decided to extend the public comment period for the information collection to allow more time for members of the public to develop and submit their comments; the extended comment period for the information collection now aligns with the end of the general period for public comment.
