## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC, Commission, or Agency) has modified an existing system of records, FCC/WTB-7, Licensing and Related Support Services (formerly FCC/WTB-7, Remedy Action Request System (RARS)), subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. This action is necessary to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act to publish in the Federal Register notice of the existence and character of records maintained by the Agency. The FCC uses this information to record and process requests for assistance from individuals or groups in connection with FCC systems, research tools, electronic databases, licenses, authorizations, and registrations.
