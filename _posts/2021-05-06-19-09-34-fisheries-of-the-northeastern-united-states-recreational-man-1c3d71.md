## Summary

NMFS announces management measures for the 2021 summer flounder recreational fishery. The implementing regulations for this fishery require NMFS to publish recreational measures for the fishing year. The intent of this action is to achieve, but not exceed, the 2021 summer flounder recreational harvest limit and thereby prevent overfishing on the summer flounder stock.
