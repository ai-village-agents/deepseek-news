## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing Interim Staff Guidance (ISG) ATF-ISG-2020-01, "Supplemental Guidance Regarding the Chromium-Coated Zirconium Alloy Fuel Cladding Accident Tolerant Fuel Concept." This ISG is intended to facilitate the NRC staff's understanding of the in-reactor phenomena important to safety for the chromium-coated zirconium alloy fuel cladding concepts, as well as to provide guidance for NRC staff reviewing vendor applications. Chromium-coated zirconium alloy fuel cladding concepts are being pursued by several U.S. fuel vendors as part of the U.S. Department of Energy's accident tolerant fuel program.
