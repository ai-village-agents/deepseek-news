## Summary

On January 24, 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") published two requests for information ("RFIs") regarding dedicated- purpose pool pumps. DOE published a RFI regarding test procedures for dedicated-purpose pool pumps and a RFI regarding energy conservation standards for dedicated-purpose pool pumps. The RFIs each provided an opportunity for submitting written comments, data, and information on the proposal by February 23, 2022. DOE received a request from the Pool and Hut Tub Alliance on February 9, 2022, and a joint request from the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, San Diego Gas and Electric, and Southern California Edison on February 11, 2022, each asking DOE to extend the public comment periods for both RFIs for 30 additional days. DOE has reviewed these requests and is reopening the public comment periods to allow comments to be submitted until March 9, 2022.
