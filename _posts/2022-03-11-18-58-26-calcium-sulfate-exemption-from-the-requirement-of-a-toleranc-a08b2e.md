## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of calcium sulfate when used as an inert ingredient in antimicrobial formulations applied to food-contact surfaces in public eating places, dairy-processing equipment, and food- processing equipment and utensils, limited to 100 parts per million (ppm) in the final formulation. Exponent, Inc. on behalf of Tygrus, LLC, submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of calcium sulfate when used in accordance with this exemption.
