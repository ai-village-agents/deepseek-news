## Summary

The USA is rescinding a System of Records, A0385-1040 ASO, Army Safety Management Information System (ASMIS). These records consist of safety investigation case files retrieved by the report identification number, incident date, location, unit identification code, accident classification, or accident description. Personal information is collected during the investigation on individuals involved in or witness to an incident; however, their personal identifiers are not used to maintain or retrieve the records. To maintain the integrity of investigatory material, the USA established specialized procedures to restrict queries to descriptors of the incident, therefore these records are not subject to the Privacy Act of 1974. Individuals involved in or witness to the incident, and other interested parties may request information collected in safety investigations records under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).
