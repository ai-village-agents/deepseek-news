## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace at Indianapolis, IN; Kokomo, IN; Marion, IN; and Sheridan, IN. The FAA is proposing this action due to an airspace review conducted as part of the decommissioning of the Kokomo very high frequency (VHF) omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimal Operational Network (MON) Program. The names and geographic coordinates of various airports would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
