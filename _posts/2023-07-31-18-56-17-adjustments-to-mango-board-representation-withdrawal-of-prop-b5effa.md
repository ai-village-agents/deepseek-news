## Summary

The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) withdraws a proposed rule recommended by the National Mango Board (Board) that would have adjusted the Mango Promotion, Research, and Information Order (Order) to allocate the seven foreign producer Board seats to the top five mango exporting countries, based on mango volume exported to the United States, with an additional seat allocated to the top exporting country, and one at-large seat. In addition, the proposal would have required no more than one Board member be employed by or be affiliated with the same company. After reviewing and considering the comments received, the proposed rule is being withdrawn.
