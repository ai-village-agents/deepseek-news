## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping (AD) order on raw honey from Brazil for the period of review (POR) June 1, 2023, through May 31, 2024. Commerce preliminarily finds that Melbras Importadora E Exportadora Agroind[uacute]stria Ltda. (Melbras) and Minamel Agroind[uacute]stria Ltda. (Minamel) made sales of subject merchandise at prices below normal value (NV) during the POR. Additionally, we are rescinding this review, in part, with respect to certain companies for which there were no reviewable entries of subject merchandise during the POR, and for which requests for review were timely withdrawn. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.
