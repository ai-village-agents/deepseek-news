## Summary

NMFS is implementing specifications submitted by the New England and Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Councils (collectively, the Councils) in Framework Adjustment 13 to the Monkfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP). This action sets monkfish specifications for fishing years 2023 through 2025, adjusts annual Days-At-Sea (DAS) allocations, and, beginning in fishing year 2026, increases the minimum gillnet mesh size for vessels fishing on monkfish DAS. This action is needed to establish allowable monkfish harvest levels and management measures that will prevent overfishing and reduce bycatch.
