## Summary

Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) is proposing an adjustment to the base charge and rates for fiscal year (FY) 2021 Boulder Canyon Project (BCP) electric service under Rate Schedule BCP- F10. The proposal would reduce the base charge 1.2 percent from $66.4 million in FY 2020 to $65.6 million for FY 2021. The reduction is primarily the result of an increase in prior year carryover funds and non-power revenue projections for the Hoover Dam visitor center. The proposed base charge and rates would go into effect on October 1, 2020, and remain in effect through September 30, 2021. Publication of this Federal Register notice will initiate the public process.
