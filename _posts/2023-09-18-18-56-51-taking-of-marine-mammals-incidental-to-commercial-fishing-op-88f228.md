## Summary

NMFS is proposing an amendment to the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (Plan) to expand the boundaries of the Massachusetts Restricted Area to include the wedge between State and Federal waters known as the Massachusetts Restricted Area Wedge. The Massachusetts Restricted Area Wedge was closed by emergency rulemaking in 2022 and 2023 due to the immediate risk to North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) mortality and serious injury caused by buoy lines in an area with a high co-occurrence of whales and buoy lines. This risk is expected to recur annually. This action will address this gap in protection and reduce the incidental mortality and serious injury of right whales, fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus), and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in commercial trap/pot fisheries.
