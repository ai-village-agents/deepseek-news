## Summary

This action contains corrections to the final rule for the 2021-2022 Biennial Harvest Specifications and Management Measures for groundfish harvested in the U.S. exclusive economic zone off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California published on December 11, 2020. This action corrects: the Rockfish Conservation Area (RCA) waypoints for the 100 fathom depth contour, the other flatfish gear restrictions in the RCA, language describing the boundary lines for the depth contours, and the boundaries of the non-groundfish RCA for California halibut, sea cucumber, and ridgeback prawns south of 34[deg]27' N. lat. These corrections are necessary so the regulations accurately implement the Pacific Fishery Management Council's intent and are consistent with what was anticipated by participants in the groundfish fishery.
