## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is requesting that industry organizations interested in participating in the selection of a pool of nonvoting industry representatives to serve as temporary nonvoting members on the Patient Engagement Advisory Committee (the Committee) in the Center for Devices and Radiological Health notify FDA in writing. FDA is also requesting nominations for temporary nonvoting industry representatives to be included in a pool of individuals to serve on the Committee. Nominees recommended to serve as a temporary nonvoting industry representative may either be self-nominated or nominated by an industry organization. This position may be filled by representatives from different medical device areas based on expertise relevant to the topics being considered by the Committee. Nominations will be accepted for upcoming vacancies effective with this notice. FDA seeks to include the views of women and men, members of all racial and ethnic groups, and individuals with and without disabilities on its advisory committees and, therefore, encourages nominations of appropriately qualified candidates from these groups.
