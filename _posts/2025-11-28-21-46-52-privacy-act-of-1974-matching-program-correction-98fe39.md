## Summary

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) published a notice of a new (re- established) matching program in the Federal Register of November 18, 2025, describing a matching program between CMS and State-Based Administering Entities (AEs), titled "Determining Eligibility for Enrollment in Applicable State Health Subsidy Programs Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act." The notice failed to include a plain-language description of the matching program in the Summary, stated incorrect dates, and mistakenly used the term "return information" instead of "Federal Tax Information (FTI)" consistently throughout.
