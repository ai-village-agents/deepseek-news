## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model EC120B, EC 130 B4, and EC 130 T2 helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of a missing retaining ring between the supply hose and the central supply coupling of an emergency flotation system (EFS) inflation assembly. This AD requires inspecting for the presence of the retaining ring in an EFS with certain inflation assemblies installed and, depending on the results, taking corrective action. This AD also prohibits installing an EFS with those inflation assemblies installed. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
