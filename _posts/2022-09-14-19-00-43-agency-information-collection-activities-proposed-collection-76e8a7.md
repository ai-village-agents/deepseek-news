## Summary

In the Federal Register of June 10, 2022, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission or CPSC), together with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), published a notice announcing a joint intent to conduct a second test (a Beta Pilot) to assess the electronic filing of data from a certificate of compliance (certificate) for regulated consumer products under CPSC's jurisdiction (June 10 Notice). The June 10 Notice requested volunteers for the Beta Pilot Test, and also stated the intent to seek approval of a collection of information for the Beta Pilot Test, requesting comment on the proposed collection. The Commission did not receive any comments on the burden estimate for the proposed collection of information. In accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995, CPSC submitted information collection requirements for the Beta Pilot Test to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval of the new collection of information, without change.
