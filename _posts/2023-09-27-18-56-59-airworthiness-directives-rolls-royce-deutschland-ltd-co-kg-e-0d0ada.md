# Airworthiness Directives; Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG Engines

**Published:** February 05, 2026 18:56 UTC

**Original Published:** September 27, 2023 00:00 UTC
**Document Number:** 2023-21082

## Summary

The FAA is correcting a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that published in the Federal Register. The NPRM proposed to issue an airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Model RB211-Trent 800 engines. As published, the docket number referenced throughout the NPRM is incorrect. This document corrects that error. In all other respects, the original document remains the same; however, for clarity, the FAA is republishing the entire proposed rule in the Federal Register.
