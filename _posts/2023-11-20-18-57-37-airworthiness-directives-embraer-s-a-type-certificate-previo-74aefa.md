## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Embraer S.A. Model ERJ 190-100 STD, -100 LR, -100 IGW, -200 STD, -200 LR, and -200 IGW airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary and a determination by the design approval holder (DAH) that some structural elements are subject to widespread fatigue damage (WFD). This AD requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, and for certain airplanes requires a structural modification of the wing lower skin panels, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
