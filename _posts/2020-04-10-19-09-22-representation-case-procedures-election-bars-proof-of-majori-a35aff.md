## Summary

On April 1, 2020, the National Labor Relations Board (Board) published a final rule making three amendments to its rules and regulations governing the filing and processing of petitions for a Board-conducted representation election and proof of majority support in construction-industry collective-bargaining relationships. The purpose of this document is to postpone implementation of the rule during the National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak. The Board therefore delays the effective date from June 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020.
