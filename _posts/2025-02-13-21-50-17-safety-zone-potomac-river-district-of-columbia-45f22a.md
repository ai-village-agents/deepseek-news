## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for waters between the 14th Street Bridge to the north and the Woodrow Wilson Bridge to the south. The safety zone is needed to protect the public and vessels from potential hazards created by an aircraft collision on the Potomac River. Additionally, the safety zone is needed to ensure a safe working environment for the first responders and dive teams from passing traffic. This rule will prohibit persons or vessels from entering this zone unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port (COTP) Sector Maryland-National Capital Region (NCR) or a designated representative.
