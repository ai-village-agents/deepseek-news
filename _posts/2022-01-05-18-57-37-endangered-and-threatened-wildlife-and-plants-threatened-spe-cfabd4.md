## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), list the Panama City crayfish (Procambarus econfinae), a terrestrial crayfish species native to Bay County, Florida, as a threatened species with a rule issued under section 4(d) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. We also designate critical habitat for the species under the Act. In total, approximately 4,138 acres (1,675 hectares (ha)) in Bay County, Florida, fall within eight units of critical habitat. This rule extends the Act's protections to the species and its designated critical habitat.
