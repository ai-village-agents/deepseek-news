## Summary

The Department of the Army (Army) announces the availability of a Second Draft Environmental Impact Statement (Draft EIS) regarding its proposed action to retain up to approximately 22,750 acres of the 23,000 acres of land the Army currently leases from the State of Hawai[revaps]i ("State-owned land") at P[omacr]hakuloa Training Area (PTA) on the island of Hawai[revaps]i. The Army is publishing the Draft EIS for public review during a 45-day comment period. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Hawai[revaps]i Environmental Policy Act (HEPA), the Draft EIS analyzes the potential direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of a range of reasonable alternatives that meet the purpose of, and need for, the proposed action. Because the proposed action involves State-owned land, the EIS is a joint NEPA-HEPA document; therefore, the public review process runs concurrently and meets both NEPA and HEPA requirements.
