## Summary

The Department of Labor (Department or DOL) is issuing this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to seek public comments on a proposal to require electronic filing (e-filing) and make acceptance of electronic service (e-service) automatic for attorneys and non-attorney representatives representing parties in proceedings before the Administrative Review Board (Board), unless the Board authorizes non- electronic filing and service for good cause. Self-represented persons will have the option of e-filing or of filing papers by conventional means. This proposed rule would establish a new part containing rules of practice and procedure for the Board and amend existing regulations concerning filing and service that would apply where a governing statute or executive order does not establish contrary rules of filing and service. It would also make other minor corrections to update existing regulations.
