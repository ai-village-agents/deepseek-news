## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is denying Yong Sheng Jiao's application for termination of debarment under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). Mr. Jiao was given notice of the proposed denial of his application for termination of his debarment and was given an opportunity to request a hearing to show why his application for termination of debarment should be granted. As of June 16, 2025 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Mr. Jiao had not requested a hearing and through his attorney informed FDA he would not be requesting a hearing in this matter. Mr. Jiao's failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this matter.
