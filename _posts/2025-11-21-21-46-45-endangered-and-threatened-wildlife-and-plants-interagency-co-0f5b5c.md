## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS; collectively, the "Services") propose to revise portions of our regulations for section 7 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (ESA or Act). The proposed revisions to the interagency cooperation regulations confirm the Services' application of statutory requirements for interagency cooperation, while continuing to provide for the conservation of listed species.
