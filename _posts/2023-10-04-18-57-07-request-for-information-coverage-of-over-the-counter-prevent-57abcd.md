## Summary

This document is a request for information (RFI) regarding the application of the preventive services requirements under section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) to over-the-counter (OTC) preventive items and services available without a prescription by a health care provider. The Department of the Treasury, the Department of Labor, and the Department of Health and Human Services (the Departments) are issuing this RFI to gather input from the public regarding the potential benefits and costs of requiring non- grandfathered group health plans and health insurance issuers offering non-grandfathered group or individual health insurance coverage to cover OTC preventive items and services without cost sharing and without a prescription by a health care provider; seek comment on any potential challenges associated with providing such coverage; understand whether and how providing such coverage would benefit consumers; and assess any potential burden that plans and issuers would face if required to provide such coverage.
