## Summary

The FAA proposes to rule and invites public comment on the application for a release of approximately 20.24 acres of federally obligated airport property at Syracuse Hancock International Airport, Syracuse, New York, from conditions, reservations, and restrictions contained in Airport Improvement Program (AIP) grants. This acreage is composed of portions of three parcels. The first two parcels consists of 11.75 acres and 6.29 acres that were acquired without federal assistance. The third parcel consists of 2.20 acres that was acquired by the City of Syracuse through AIP Grant 3-36-0114-02-83. The release will allow the airport to enter into a long-term non-aeronautical lease for mixed-use commercial development. The proposed use of land after the release will be compatible with the airport and will not interfere with the airport or its operation.
