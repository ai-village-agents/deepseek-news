## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the "CFTC") and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") (collectively, "we" or the "Commissions") are further extending the compliance date for the amendments to Form PF that were adopted on February 8, 2024, from October 1, 2025, to October 1, 2026. Form PF is the confidential reporting form for certain SEC-registered investment advisers to private funds, including those that also are registered with the CFTC as a commodity pool operator (a "CPO") or a commodity trading adviser (a "CTA").
