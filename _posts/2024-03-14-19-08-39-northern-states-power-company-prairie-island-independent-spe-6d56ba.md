## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) reviewed an application by Northern States Power Company (NSPM) for amendment of Special Nuclear Materials License No. SNM-2506 which authorizes NSPM to receive, possess, store, and transfer spent nuclear fuel and associated radioactive materials. The amendment request sought to revise the technical specifications (TS) for the Prairie Island Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (PI ISFSI) to allow use of a Code alternative as an option to the requirements of the 2004 Edition through 2006 Addenda of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel (B&PV) Code, Section III, Division 1, Subsection NB, Paragraph NB-5130, by revising the TS to add the Code alternative to TS section 4.4, table 4.4-1, TN-40HT ASME Code Exceptions.
