## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A330-200 Freighter series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a widespread fatigue damage (WFD) evaluation on Airbus SAS Model A330-200 Freighter series airplanes, which found that the circumferential joint at Frame 58 (near the rear fuselage) is susceptible to WFD. This AD requires a modification to reinforce the circumferential joints at Frame 58 and, if necessary, corrective action, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
