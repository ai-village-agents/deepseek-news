## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing for public comment draft regulatory guide (DG), DG-1385, "Water Sources for Long-Term Recirculation Cooling Following a Loss-of-Coolant Accident." This DG is proposed Revision 5 to Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.82, which describes an approach that may be used to determine quality standards acceptable to the NRC staff, to meet the regulatory requirements for sumps and suppression pools that provide water sources for emergency core cooling, containment heat removal, or containment atmosphere cleanup systems. It also provides guidelines for evaluating the adequacy and the availability of the sump or suppression pool for long-term recirculation cooling following a loss-of-coolant-accident, and the use of containment accident pressure in determining the net positive suction head for the emergency core cooling and containment heat removal pumps. This proposed revision guidance applies to both the pressurized-water reactor (PWR) and boiling-water reactor (BWR) types of light-water reactors.
