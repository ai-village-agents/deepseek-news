## Summary

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is initiating a research study to evaluate workplace hazards to landscapers, groundskeepers, hardscapers and arborists and to develop appropriate controls to minimize or eliminate those hazards. NIOSH is seeking up to nine firms in the landscaping and grounds management fields to participate in the pilot study that will evaluate how outdoor power tools can create hazards that may result in occupational health impacts. NIOSH will use this information to design effective solutions, such as engineering controls for power tools. The findings and controls information will be shared with participating workers and companies.
