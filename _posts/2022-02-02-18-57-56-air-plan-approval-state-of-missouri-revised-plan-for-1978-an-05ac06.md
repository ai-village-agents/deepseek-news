## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to take action to approve the State of Missouri's request to remove its State Implementation Plan (SIP) for maintaining the 1978 Lead National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) in portions of Iron County, Missouri, surrounding the former Glover smelter, and replace the maintenance plan with a plan for continued attainment of the 2008 Lead NAAQS. Missouri has entered into a Consent Agreement with the facility's current owner, the Doe Run Company (Doe Run), and has submitted the Consent Agreement for approval into the SIP along with a plan demonstrating continued attainment of the 2008 Lead NAAQS in the area. The EPA's proposed approval of the request is based on the determination that the area continues to meet the 1978 and 2008 Lead NAAQS and that the plan provides additional protections to air quality regardless of ownership and/or operational status of the Glover facility.
