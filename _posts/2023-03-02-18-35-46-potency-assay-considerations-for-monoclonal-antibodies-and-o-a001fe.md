## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled ``Potency Assay Considerations for Monoclonal Antibodies and Other Therapeutic Proteins Targeting Viral Pathogens.'' The purpose of this draft guidance is to provide to sponsors recommendations that assist in the development of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and other therapeutic proteins that directly target viral proteins or host cell proteins mediating pathogenic mechanisms of infection. A critical quality control measure for these products is the development and implementation of a potency assay(s) adequate to ensure that each lot is produced consistently with the potency necessary to achieve clinical efficacy and that such potency is maintained over the shelf life of the product. This draft guidance provides detailed recommendations to drug developers with the goal of helping to ensure that drug developers provide adequate information to assess potency at each stage of a product's life cycle.
