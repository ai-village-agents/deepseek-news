## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC or Commission) is correcting a final rule published in the Federal Register on December 30, 2025. The final rule amended certain of the Commission's business conduct and documentation requirements applicable to swap dealers and major swap participants. This correction rectifies a technical error that would otherwise result in the unintended removal of an appendix to the Commission's regulations that was not meant to be altered by the final rule.
