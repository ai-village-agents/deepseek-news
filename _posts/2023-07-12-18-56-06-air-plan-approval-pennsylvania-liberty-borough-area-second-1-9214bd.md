## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve the Liberty Borough area second 10-year maintenance plan submitted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP or Commonwealth) on behalf of the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD). This plan addresses the second 10-year maintenance period after redesignation for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM<INF>10</INF>). A limited maintenance plan (LMP) is used to meet the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act) requirements for formerly designated nonattainment areas that meet certain qualification criteria. EPA is proposing to determine that ACHD's second maintenance plan meets applicable CAA requirements. The plan relies upon control measures contained in the attainment plan and the first 10-year maintenance plan and the determination that the Liberty Borough area currently monitors PM<INF>10</INF> levels well below the PM<INF>10</INF> national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or standard).
