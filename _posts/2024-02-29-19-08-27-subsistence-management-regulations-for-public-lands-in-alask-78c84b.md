## Summary

This final rule revises regulations for seasons, harvest limits, methods, and means related to taking of fish for subsistence uses in Alaska during the 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 regulatory years and the customary and traditional use determinations for fish and shellfish. This rule also revises the regulations for subsistence taking of wildlife, in response to deferred proposals from the 2022- 2024 wildlife regulations cycle. The Federal Subsistence Management Program provides a preference for customary and traditional uses by rural Alaska residents of wild, renewable resources on Federal public lands and waters in Alaska.
