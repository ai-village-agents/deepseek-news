## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA, the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Oklahoma through the Secretary of Energy & Environment on November 7, 2016. The revision was submitted in response to a finding of substantial inadequacy and SIP call as published by EPA on June 12, 2015, concerning excess emissions during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) events. EPA is approving the SIP revision and finds that it corrects the inadequacies identified in Oklahoma's SIP in the June 12, 2015 SIP call.
