## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is granting an exemption to allow a departure from the certification information in Tier 1 of the plant-specific design control document (DCD) and is issuing License Amendment No. 182 to Combined License (COL) NPF-91. The COL is for construction and operation of the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3, located in Burke County, Georgia. The granting of the exemption allows the changes to Tier 1 information asked for in the amendment. Because the acceptability of the exemption was determined in part by the acceptability of the amendment, the exemption and amendment are being issued concurrently.
