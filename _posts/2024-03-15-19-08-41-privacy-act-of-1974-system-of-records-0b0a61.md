## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of the Treasury ("Treasury" or the "Department"), Departmental Offices proposes to modify a current Treasury system of records titled, "Department of the Treasury, Departmental Offices .190--Office of Inspector General Investigations Management Information System." This system's name is being amended to the "Department of the Treasury, Departmental Offices .190--Office of Inspector General Electronic Case Management System," yet it will still maintain the same records and collected information that provides essential support for activities of the Treasury Office of Inspector General (OIG) relating to Treasury programs, operations, employees, contractors and other individuals or entities associated with the Department. Additionally, the Department proposes to amend this system of records by modifying one existing routine use, adding four new routine uses, and making technical changes and corrections.
