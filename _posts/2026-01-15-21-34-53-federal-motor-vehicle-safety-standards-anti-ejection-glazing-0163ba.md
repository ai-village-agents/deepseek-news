# Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards: Anti-Ejection Glazing for Bus Portals; Mandatory Applicability Beginning October 30, 2027

## Summary

This document partially grants a petition for reconsideration of the October 30, 2024 final rule that established Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 217a, "Anti-ejection glazing for bus portals; Mandatory applicability beginning October 30, 2027." The standard intends to drive installation of advanced glazing in over-the- road buses (motorcoaches) and other large buses to reduce occupant ejections. This final rule revises the minimum size requirement for applicable portals, adds a figure to illustrate a daylight opening periphery, and clarifies the target location for edge impact tests. This document denies all other portions of the petition for reconsideration, including revising the definition of "daylight opening."
