## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) implements the "all-in" rule, requiring cable operators and direct broadcast satellite (DBS) providers to state an aggregate price for the video programming that they provide as a clear, easy-to- understand, and accurate single line item on subscribers' bills, including on bills for legacy or grandfathered video programming service plans. The "all-in" rule also requires cable operators and DBS providers that communicate a price for video programming in promotional materials to state the aggregate price for the video programming in a clear, easy-to-understand, and accurate manner.
