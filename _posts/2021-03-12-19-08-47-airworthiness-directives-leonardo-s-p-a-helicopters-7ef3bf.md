## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain serial-numbered Leonardo S.p.a. (Leonardo) Model A109S and AW109SP helicopters. This AD requires installing a placard in the baggage compartment, revising the existing Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) for your helicopter, and inspecting the installation of the terminal lugs. Depending on the outcome of the inspection, this AD requires restoring the installation of the terminal lugs. This AD would also require modifying the helicopter to shim the baggage fairing assy (fwd up) away from the circuit breaker panel and incorporating protective coverings. This AD was prompted by reports of several occurrences of fire ignition and smoke in the baggage compartment. The actions of this AD are intended to address an unsafe condition on these products.
