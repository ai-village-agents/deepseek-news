## Summary

FMCSA requests public comment on the APA's application for exemptions from certain hours-of-service (HOS) regulations. Previous similar exemptions expired on July 8, 2024. The exemptions would allow drivers to exclude off-duty and sleeper berth time of any length from the calculation of the 14-hour limit and to use paper records of duty status (RODS) in lieu of an electronic logging device (ELD) during the designated period of June 28 through July 8 (Independence Day period). The requests are for the transportation of pyrotechnics during the Independence Day period of every year from 2025 through 2029.
