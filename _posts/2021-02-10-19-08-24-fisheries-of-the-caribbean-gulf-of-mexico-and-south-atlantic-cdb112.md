## Summary

NMFS implements an accountability measure for the commercial longline component for golden tilefish in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the South Atlantic. Commercial longline landings for golden tilefish are projected to reach the longline component's commercial quota by February 10, 2021. Therefore, NMFS closes the commercial longline component of golden tilefish in the South Atlantic EEZ on February 10, 2021, at 12:01 a.m. local time. This closure is necessary to protect the golden tilefish resource.
