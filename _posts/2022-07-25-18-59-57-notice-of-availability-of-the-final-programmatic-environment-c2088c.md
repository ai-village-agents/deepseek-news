## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announces the availability of the Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) for VA's Housing Loan Program (HLP). The Final PEIS identifies, analyzes, and documents the potential physical, environmental, cultural, socioeconomic, and cumulative impacts of continued administration and operation of VA's HLP. The comprehensive HLP, which is managed by VA's Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), administers VA-guaranteed housing loan benefits and other housing-related benefits that assist eligible Veterans, surviving spouses, active-duty personnel, Selected Reservists, and National Guardsmen (collectively referred to as Veterans) in purchasing, constructing, repairing, adapting, or improving a home. In preparing the Final PEIS, VA has considered public comments received on the Draft PEIS, which was published in July 2021.
