## Summary

This action extends the prohibition against certain flight operations in the territory and airspace of Libya by all: U.S. air carriers; U.S. commercial operators; persons exercising the privileges of an airman certificate issued by the FAA, except when such persons are operating U.S.-registered aircraft for a foreign air carrier; and operators of U.S.-registered civil aircraft, except when the operator of such aircraft is a foreign air carrier for an additional three years, from March 20, 2025, to March 20, 2028. The FAA finds this action necessary to address continuing risks to persons and aircraft engaged in such flight operations. The FAA also republishes the approval process and exemption information for this Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR), consistent with other recently published flight prohibition SFARs.
