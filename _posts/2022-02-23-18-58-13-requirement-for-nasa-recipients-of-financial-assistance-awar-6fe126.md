## Summary

The Grants Policy and Compliance Branch (GPC) in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Office of the Chief Financial Officer is soliciting public comment on the Agency's proposed implementation of a new term and condition that requires recipients of NASA financial assistance to obtain a quotation from small and/or minority businesses, women's business enterprises or labor surplus area firms when the acquisition of goods or services exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold. In response to the Executive Order regarding Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, NASA has been working to identify and address barriers that underserved communities and individuals may face in taking advantage of procurement, contracting, or grant opportunities. To address these barriers, NASA has taken a few actions including proposing the term and condition described above. NASA is taking this action to ensure that entities funded by NASA are compliant with the procurement standards in the uniform guidance. NASA's expectation is that this action will result in an increase in contracting opportunities for small and/or minority businesses, women's business enterprises and labor surplus area firms that contract with NASA financial assistance recipients.
