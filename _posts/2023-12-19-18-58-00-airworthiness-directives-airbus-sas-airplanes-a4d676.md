## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-12- 07, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A318-111, -112, -121, and - 122 airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2019-12-07 required replacement of both main landing gear (MLG) shock absorbers, an identification of affected MLG sliding tubes; inspection of affected chromium plates and sliding tube axles for damage; and replacement of the sliding tube if necessary. AD 2019- 12-07 also required repetitive inspections of affected MLG sliding tubes for cracking, replacement of cracked MLG sliding tubes, and eventual replacement of each affected MLG sliding tube. This AD continues to require the actions specified in AD 2019-12-07 and requires repetitive inspections of additional MLG sliding tubes, replacement if necessary, and eventual replacement of the additional MLG sliding tubes. This AD also extends the repetitive inspection interval. This AD also prohibits the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. This AD was prompted by the FAA's determination that additional MLG sliding tubes are affected by the unsafe condition and that the repetitive inspection interval may be extended. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
