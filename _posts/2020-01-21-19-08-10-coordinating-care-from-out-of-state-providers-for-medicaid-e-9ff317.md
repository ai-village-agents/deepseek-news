## Summary

This document is a request for information (RFI) to seek public comments regarding the coordination of care from out-of-state providers for Medicaid-eligible children with medically complex conditions. We wish to identify best practices for using out-of-state providers to provide care to children with medically complex conditions; determine how care is coordinated for such children when that care is provided by out-of-state providers, including when care is provided in emergency and non-emergency situations; reduce barriers that prevent such children from receiving care from out-of-state providers in a timely fashion; and identify processes for screening and enrolling out-of-state providers in Medicaid, including efforts to streamline such processes for out-of-state providers or to reduce the burden of such processes on them. We intend to use the information received in response to this RFI to issue guidance to state Medicaid directors on the coordination of care from out-of-state providers for children with medically complex conditions.
