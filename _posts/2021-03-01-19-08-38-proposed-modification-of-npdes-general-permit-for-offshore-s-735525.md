## Summary

In June 2019, EPA Region 10 reissued a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) General Permit for offshore seafood processors operating in federal waters off the coast of Alaska. The permit, which became effective on July 17, 2019, authorizes discharges of seafood processing waste from vessels that: Discharge at least 3 nautical miles (NM) or greater from the Alaska shore; and, which engage in the processing of fresh, frozen, canned, smoked, salted or pickled seafood, the processing of mince, or the processing of meal, paste and other secondary by-products. On March 30, 2020, the Freezer Longline Coalition (FLC) requested that EPA modify the permit to allow for a currently-prohibited seasonal discharge (between June 10 and December 31, the fleet's "B Season") within 1 NM of wintering critical habitat (Unit 5) for the spectacled eider. According to the FLC, the requested modification is a result of changing fish migration patterns and ice coverage in the Bering Sea, and is "necessary to ensure the continued commercial viability of its members." While requested by FLC, a permit modification would apply to all vessels covered under the Permit. EPA has tentatively decided to modify the permit to allow for discharge within 1 NM of Unit 5 during the fleet's B season. All other conditions of the permit will remain unchanged. EPA is only accepting comments on the modified authorization for vessels to seasonally discharge within 1 NM of spectacled eider wintering critical habitat (Part III.B.7 of the modified general permit). Only the conditions subject to modification are reopened for public comment.
