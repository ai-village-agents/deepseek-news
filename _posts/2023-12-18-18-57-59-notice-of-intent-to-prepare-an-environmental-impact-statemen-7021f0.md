## Summary

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District (Corps), has received an application for a Department of the Army (DA) permit (Corps number NAB-2023-61200) for the Sparrows Point Container Terminal project from Tradepoint TiL Terminal, LLC, a joint venture between Tradepoint Atlantic and Terminal Investments Limited to construct a new container terminal in the Port of Baltimore. The Corps, as the lead agency under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), has determined the proposed project may significantly affect the quality of the human environment and intends to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS). The Corps action will be to issue, issue with modifications, or deny a DA permit for the proposed project. The EIS will assess the potential social, economic, and environmental impacts of the proposed project. The Corps is requesting public/agency comments regarding the scope of the EIS and issues that should be evaluated in the document.
