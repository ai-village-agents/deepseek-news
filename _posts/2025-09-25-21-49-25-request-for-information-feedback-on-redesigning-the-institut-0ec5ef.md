## Summary

The Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 established the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) as the research, evaluation, and statistics arm of the U.S. Department of Education. IES is responsible for generating, disseminating, and promoting the use of rigorous evidence to improve education outcomes nationwide. IES is undertaking a comprehensive reexamination to ensure that its core functions-- research, statistics, evaluation, and dissemination--are carried out in ways that maximize relevance, timeliness, and usability for the education stakeholders who rely on them. Specifically, the goal is to ensure that IES' high-quality work is translated in ways that inform teacher and practitioner practice and has a meaningful, positive impact on students' academic achievement and other outcomes. Through this RFI, we seek public input on how IES can modernize its programs, processes, and priorities to better serve the needs of the field and American students.
