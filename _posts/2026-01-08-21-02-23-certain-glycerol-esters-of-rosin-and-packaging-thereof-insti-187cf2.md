## Summary

Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on December 4, 2025, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of T&R Chemicals, Inc. of Clint, Texas. The complaint alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States and the sale of certain glycerol esters of rosin and packing thereof by reason of unfair competition through false advertising and tortious interference, the threat or effect of which is to destroy or substantially injure an industry in the United States or to prevent the establishment of an industry in the United States. The complainant requests that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a limited exclusion order and cease and desist orders.
