# Airworthiness Directives; Bell Textron Inc. (Type Certificate Previously Held by Bell Helicopter Textron Inc.) Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Bell Textron Inc. (type certificate previously held by Bell Helicopter Textron Inc.), Model 204B, 205A, 205A-1, 205B, and 210 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by events involving failure of the tail boom attachment structure. This proposed AD would require revising the existing Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) for your helicopter and repetitive inspections of structural components that attach the tail boom to the fuselage. Depending on the results of the inspections, this proposed AD would require removing certain parts from service or re-bonding the structure. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
