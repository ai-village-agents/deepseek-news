## Summary

On October 22, 2012, the EPA published a final rule in the Federal Register promulgating a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) intended to address regional haze obligations for the Territory of the United States Virgin Islands. However, at that time EPA erroneously failed to incorporate into the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) certain emission limits that had been determined to be necessary to satisfy those obligations and that had been proposed and included in the docket for the action. EPA is proposing to correct this inadvertent error by incorporating the previously noticed limits into the CFR. EPA is not reopening any of its previous determinations here.
