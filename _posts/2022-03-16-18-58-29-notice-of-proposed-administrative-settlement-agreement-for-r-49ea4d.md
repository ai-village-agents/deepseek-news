## Summary

In accordance with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended ("CERCLA"), notice is hereby given that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), has entered into a proposed settlement, embodied in an Administrative Settlement Agreement for Removal Action and Payment of Response Costs by Prospective Lessee ("Settlement Agreement"), with 1213 253rd, LLC ("Prospective Lessee"), a prospective lessee and purchaser of the real property located at 1213 253rd Street, Harbor City, Los Angeles County, California, known as the Former C-Brite Metal Finishing Facility Site ("C-Brite Site" or "Site"). C-Brite Metal Finishing, Inc. operated a plating business at the Site from 1966 to 2017 and abandoned the property thereafter. Under the Settlement Agreement, the Prospective Lessee agrees to perform a portion of the removal work at the Site and to pay $80,000 for EPA's oversight costs in exchange for liability protection, contribution protection, a release of any lien on the Site under CERCLA Section 107(r) or 107(l), and a covenant not to sue for existing contamination at the Site, the payment of EPA's oversight costs, or the removal work. EPA completed the removal of hazardous contamination at the site, and the Lessee will now continue with the removal of all the remaining non-hazardous debris.
