## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 96-12-11, which applied to all Canadair Model CL-215-1A10 airplanes. AD 96-12-11 required repetitive inspections to detect discrepancies of the microswitches fitted at the water door actuator; replacement of any discrepant microswitch; and modification of the water door actuator switches, which terminates the repetitive inspections. This AD continues to require the modification of the water door actuator switches. This AD also requires modification of the water door solenoid valve common grounds, adds airplanes to the applicability, and specifies a parts installation limitation for the water door solenoid valve. This AD was prompted by reports of uncommanded opening of the water doors during flight and water scooping. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
