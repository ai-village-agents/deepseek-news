## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-21-15, which applies to certain Diamond Aircraft Industries GmbH (DAI) Model DA 42, DA 42 NG, and DA 42 M-NG airplanes. AD 2022-21-15 requires replacing the rudder T-yoke axle with an improved rudder T-yoke axle. Since the FAA issued AD 2022- 21-15, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) superseded its mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) to correct an unsafe condition on these products. This proposed AD would require, for certain airplanes, inspecting the rudder steering bracket edge distance and depending on the inspection results, inspecting the T-yoke bolt hole for wear and play, and corrective action if necessary. For certain airplanes this proposed AD would require replacing the rudder T-yoke bolt (axle) with a serviceable part, and applying torque seal marks on the rudder T-yoke bolt head, and self-locking nut. For all airplanes this proposed AD would require repetitively inspecting the torque seal marks on the rudder T-yoke bolt head for proper alignment and the self- locking nut for proper installation and corrective action if necessary. This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
