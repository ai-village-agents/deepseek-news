## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing an exemption in response to a September 28, 2023, request from Holtec Decommissioning International, LLC (HDI), on behalf of Holtec Palisades, LLC. The exemption supports the reauthorization of power operations at the Palisades Nuclear Plant (PNP), and allows for a one- time rescission of the docketed decommissioning certifications to remove the restriction that prohibits operation of the PNP reactor and emplacement and retention of fuel into the PNP reactor vessel. The NRC is also rescinding six exemptions that were previously granted based on PNP's decommissioning status.
