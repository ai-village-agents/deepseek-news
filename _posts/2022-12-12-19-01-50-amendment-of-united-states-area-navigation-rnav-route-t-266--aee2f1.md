## Summary

This action corrects a final rule published by the FAA in the Federal Register on October 24, 2022, that amends Area Navigation (RNAV) route T-266 in support of a large and comprehensive T-route modernization project for the state of Alaska. In the T-266 description in the final rule, the order of the listed route points was reversed in error. This action makes editorial corrections to list the T-266 route points to match the route data forms and the FAA National Airspace System Resource (NASR) database information.
