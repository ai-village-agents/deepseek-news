## Summary

NMFS Office of Protected Resources, upon request from the St. George Reef Lighthouse Preservation Society (Society), hereby issues regulations to govern the unintentional taking of marine mammals incidental to conducting aircraft operations, lighthouse renovation, light maintenance activities, and tour operations on the St. George Reef Lighthouse Station (Station) on Northwest Seal Rock (NWSR) over the course of five years (2022-2027). These regulations, which allow for the issuance of Letters of Authorization (LOA) for the incidental take of marine mammals during the described activities and specified timeframes, prescribe the permissible methods of taking and other means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact on marine mammal species or stocks and their habitat, as well as requirements pertaining to the monitoring and reporting of such taking. We are also issuing a Letter of Authorization to cover the first year of these activities.
