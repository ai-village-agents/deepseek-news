## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Goodrich cabin attendant seats installed on Airbus SAS Model A330- 200 series, A330-200 Freighter series, A330-300 series, A330-841, A330- 941, A340-200 series, A340-300 series, A340-541, and A340-642 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that track attachments used on certain part-numbered seats are non-compliant. This proposed AD would require replacing all seat track attachments and hardware and re-identifying the seat with a new part number. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
