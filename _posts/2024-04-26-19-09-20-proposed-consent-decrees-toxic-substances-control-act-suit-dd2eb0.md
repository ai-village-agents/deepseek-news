## Summary

Notice is given of proposed consent decrees to address lawsuits filed by Community In-Power and Development Association Inc., Learning Disabilities Association of America, Louisiana Environmental Action Network, Sierra Club, and Texas Environmental Justice Advocacy Services (collectively, "CIDA Plaintiffs") in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on September 18, 2023: Community In-Power and Development Association Inc. v. EPA, Case No. 1:23-cv-02715 (D.D.C.) (the "CIDA action") and by American Chemistry Council ("ACC") in the same court on December 19, 2023: ACC v. EPA, Case No. 1:23-cv-03726 (D.D.C.) (the "ACC action"). The cases were consolidated on January 17, 2024. The CIDA Plaintiffs and ACC filed the cases pursuant to the Toxic Substances Control Act ("TSCA"), alleging that EPA failed to perform non-discretionary duties under TSCA to timely complete several risk evaluations. EPA is providing notice of the proposed consent decrees, which would resolve all claims in both cases by establishing deadlines for EPA to take action on the subject risk evaluations.
