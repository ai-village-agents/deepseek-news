# Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Withdrawal of the Proposed Rules To List the Bi-State Distinct Population Segment of Greater Sage-Grouse With Section 4(d) Rule and To Designate Critical Habitat

## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), withdraw the proposed rule to list the Bi-State distinct population segment (DPS) of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) in California and Nevada as threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). We concurrently withdraw the proposed rule under section 4(d) of the Act and the proposed rule to designate critical habitat for the DPS. These withdrawals are based on our conclusion that the threats to the DPS as identified in the proposed listing rule no longer are as significant as believed at the time of publication of the 2013 proposed rule. We find the best scientific and commercial data available indicate that the threats to the DPS and its habitat, given current and future conservation efforts, are reduced to the point that the DPS does not meet the Act's definition of an "endangered species" or of a "threatened species."
