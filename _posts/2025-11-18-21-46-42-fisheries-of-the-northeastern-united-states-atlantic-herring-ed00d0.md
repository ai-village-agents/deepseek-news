## Summary

NMFS increases the 2025 Atlantic herring annual catch limit and Area 1A sub-annual catch limit by 1,000 metric tons (mt) for the remainder of 2025. This action is required by the herring regulations when, based on data through October 1, 2025, NMFS determines that the New Brunswick weir fishery has landed less than 2,722 mt of herring. This notification informs the public of these catch limit changes.
