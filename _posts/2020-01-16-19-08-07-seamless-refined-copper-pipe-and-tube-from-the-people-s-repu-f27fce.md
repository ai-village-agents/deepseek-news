## Summary

The Department of Commerce (Commerce) finds that sales of seamless refined copper pipe and tube (copper pipe and tube) from the People's Republic of China (China) were made at less than normal value during the period of review (POR), November 1, 2017 through October 31, 2018. We further find that each of the companies for which an administrative review was requested, and not withdrawn, failed to demonstrate eligibility for a separate rate; therefore, each is part of the China-wide entity.
