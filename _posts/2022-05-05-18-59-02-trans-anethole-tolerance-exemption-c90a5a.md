## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of trans-anethole (CAS No. 4180-23-8) when used as a fragrance inert ingredient in pesticide formulations at a concentration of 3% of the formulation in pre-harvest applications to crops. Landis International, Inc., on behalf of Morse Enterprises Limited, Inc. d/b/a KeyPlex submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of trans- anethole (CAS No. 4180-23-8) on food or feed commodities when used in accordance with this exemption.
