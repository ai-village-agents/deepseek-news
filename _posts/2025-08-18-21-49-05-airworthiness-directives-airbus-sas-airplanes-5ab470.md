## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A300 B4-2C, A300 B4-203, A300 B4-603, A300 B4- 605R, A300 B4-622, A300 B4-622R, and A300 F4-605R airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of cracking of the main landing gear (MLG) support rib 5 lower flange on certain modified airplanes due to incorrect accomplishment of modification instructions. This AD requires a special detailed inspection (geometrical inspection) of the MLG rib 5 lower flange holes on the left-hand wing and right-hand wing and repair if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
