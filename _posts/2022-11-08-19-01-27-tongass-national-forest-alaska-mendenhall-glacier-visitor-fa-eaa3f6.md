## Summary

The Tongass National Forest, Alaska, intends to prepare a supplemental draft environmental impact statement (SDEIS) for the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Facility Improvements Project. The notice of availability for the draft EIS was published on March 4, 2022 and amended on April 15, 2022. Public comments on the draft EIS requested analysis of additional alternatives, primarily related to the siting of a proposed Welcome Center and parking areas at the Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area (MGRA) in Juneau, Alaska. The SDEIS will include three new action alternatives. Although not required, this notice of intent provides for public awareness of the forthcoming SDEIS.
