## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice invites the general public and other public agencies to comment on this proposed information collection for the revision of a currently approved collection for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Employment and Training (E&T) Program Activity Report (form FNS- 583) and State requests for additional funding. The Employment and Training Opportunities in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program final rule modified the regulations to introduce priorities for reallocation of 100 percent funds and to specify that State agencies requesting additional funds should submit the requests for the upcoming fiscal year with the E&T State Plans. Requests and recordkeeping for these activities are currently approved under OMB No. 0584-0339, expiration date 03/31/2024. The burden estimate is 49.51 hours. The burden estimate is not impacted by these changes. FNS is not seeking comment on the reporting burden for the FNS-583 because that is under FNS' web-based Food Program Reporting System, OMB Control No: 0584- 0594, expiration date 7/31/2023 (currently under review).
