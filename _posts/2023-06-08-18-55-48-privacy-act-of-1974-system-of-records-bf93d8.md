## Summary

The Department of the Interior (DOI) is issuing a public notice of its intent to rescind the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) Privacy Act system of records notice (SORN), INTERIOR/WBR-37, Trespass Cases, from its existing inventory. Reclamation has decommissioned records previously maintained within this system and migrated those records into the INTERIOR/DOI-10, Incident Management, Analysis and Reporting System. This rescindment will eliminate an unnecessary duplicate notice and promote the overall streamlining and management of DOI Privacy Act systems of records.
