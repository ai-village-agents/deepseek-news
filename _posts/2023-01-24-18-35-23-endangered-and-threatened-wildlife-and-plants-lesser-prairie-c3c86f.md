## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are delaying the effective date of a final rule we published on November 25, 2022, and corrected on December 2, 2022, listing two distinct population segments (DPSs) of the lesser prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act) and establishing measures that are necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation of the Northern DPS pursuant to section 4(d) of the Act. This delay is necessary for the Service to finalize conservation tools and guidance documents to avoid confusion and disruption with Federal agencies in the implementation of section 7 of the Act and to avoid disruption to the public who would be regulated by the rule.
