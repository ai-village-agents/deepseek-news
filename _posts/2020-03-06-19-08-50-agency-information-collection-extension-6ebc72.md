## Summary

DOE's Office of Fossil Energy (FE) invites public comments on the proposed collection of information pursuant to natural gas import and export applications, as required under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. DOE requests a three-year extension, with changes, to the data collection that includes Form FE-746R, Import and Export of Natural Gas under OMB Control Number 1901-0294. Form FE-746R collects information from authorized importers and exporters of natural gas. The information FE proposes to collect from import and export authorization holders, including on FE-746R, enables DOE's Office of Fossil Energy (FE) to monitor such trade under the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA), as well as other trade activity falling outside the parameters of USMCA and supports various market and regulatory analyses done by FE.
