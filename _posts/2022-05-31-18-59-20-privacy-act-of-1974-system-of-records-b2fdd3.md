## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the DoD is modifying and reissuing a current system of records titled, "Defense Case Activity Tracking System (D-CATS)," CIG-16. The system of records is being retitled, "Inspector General Administrative Investigation Records (IGAIR)." This system of records was originally established by the DoD Office of Inspector General (OIG) to collect and maintain records on individuals who file DoD Hotline complaints and individuals suspected of misconduct and investigated pursuant to the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended. This system of records notice (SORN) is being updated to incorporate the DoD standard routine uses and support additional information sharing of records outside of the DoD in furtherance of external oversight, case management, and required reporting. This modification revises the system name, system location, system manager, authority for maintenance, purpose, categories of individuals, categories of records, record source categories, routine uses, policies, and practices for retention and disposal of records, policies and practices for retrieval of information, information safeguards, record access procedures, contesting records, and notification procedures and the exemptions promulgated. Additionally, the DoD will issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to exempt this system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act in a future issue of the Federal Register.
