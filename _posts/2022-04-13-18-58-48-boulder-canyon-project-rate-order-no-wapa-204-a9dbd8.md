## Summary

The Desert Southwest Region (DSW) of the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) is proposing to renew the Boulder Canyon Project (BCP) formula rates for electric service and to calculate the fiscal year (FY) 2023 base charge and rates under proposed Rate Schedule BCP-F11. The existing formula rates under Rate Schedule BCP-F10 and the current base charge and rates expire on September 30, 2022. The proposed formula rates under Rate Schedule BCP- F11 would be effective October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2027. WAPA proposes no changes to the existing formula rates, which are set forth in the governing terms of the BCP Electric Service Contract (ESC). The FY 2023 proposed base charge for BCP electric service is projected to increase from $67.4 million in FY 2022 to $69.9 million in FY 2023, a 3.7 percent increase. The change is primarily the result of cost increases in Bureau of Reclamation's (Reclamation) Operations and Maintenance (O&M) and visitor services expenses. Publication of this Federal Register notice will initiate the public process to put into place the proposed formula rates for electric service and the proposed FY 2023 base charge and rates.
