# Dairy Donation Program

**Published:** February 05, 2026 18:56 UTC

## Summary

On September 1, 2021, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) amended the provisions of the Milk Donation Reimbursement Program through September 1, 2023, and added regulations for the Dairy Donation Program, on an interim basis, set to expire September 1, 2023. On August 24, 2023, AMS published a final rule further amending the provisions of both programs and removing the expiration date for the Dairy Donation Program. However, we failed to formally adopt the interim provisions, remove the expiration of the amendments to the Milk Donation Reimbursement Program, and list the removal of both expirations in the DATES section of the preamble. This final rule corrects that oversight.
