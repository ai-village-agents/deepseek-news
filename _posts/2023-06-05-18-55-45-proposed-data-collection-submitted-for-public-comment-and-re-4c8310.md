## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Sealant Efficiency Assessment for Locals and States (SEALS). This data will be collected from local school sealant programs to generate efficiency performance measures, which will allow CDC to identify feasible benchmarks and best practices contributing to school sealant program efficiency.
