## Summary

The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is amending its regulations to end the program under which FSIS inspectors provide fee- for-service certification that certain foods for dogs, cats and other carnivora (pet food) are produced under sanitary conditions and meet compositional and labeling requirements. The certified pet food regulations are outdated, and no firms are paying for FSIS certification services for pet food. Further, the fact that both the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) maintain regulations concerning pet food has led to industry and consumer confusion. Both agencies agreed that stakeholders will benefit from the simplification of Federal jurisdiction over pet food.
