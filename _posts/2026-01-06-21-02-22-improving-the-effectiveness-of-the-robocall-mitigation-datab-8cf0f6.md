## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) adopts rules requiring Robocall Mitigation Database (RMD or Database) filers to take additional steps to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and currentness of submitted information. The rules also establish a base forfeiture of $10,000 for each violation for filers that submit false or inaccurate information to the Database, as well as a base forfeiture of $1,000 for failure to update information that has changed in the Database within 10 days. Further, the Wireline Competition Bureau is directed to establish a dedicated reporting mechanism for deficient filings in the Database, as well as to issue additional guidance and "best practices" for filers. Additionally, the Wireline Competition Bureau and Office of the Managing Director are directed to develop a two-factor (or more) authentication solution for accessing the Database.
