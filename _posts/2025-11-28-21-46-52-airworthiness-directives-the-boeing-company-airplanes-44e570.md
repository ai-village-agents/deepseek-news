## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-26- 03, which applied to all The Boeing Company Model 757-200 series airplanes. AD 2018-26-03 required, for the Captain's and First Officer's seats, repetitive horizontal actuator identifications, repetitive checks of the horizontal movement system (HMS), a detailed inspection of the HMS, as applicable, and applicable on-condition actions. AD 2018-26-03 also required a general visual inspection to determine the seat part numbers of the Captain's and First Officer's seats, a cable adjustment check on seats with certain seat part numbers, and applicable on-condition actions. This AD was prompted by reports of uncommanded movement of the Captain's and First Officer's seats. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2018-26-03 and adds an inspection for previously omitted part numbers. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
