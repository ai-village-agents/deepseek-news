## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on September 21, 2021. The collection involves each passenger carrying air carrier operating under the Code of Federal Regulations to post on the internet website of the air carrier the maximum dimensions of a child safety seat that can be used on those aircraft. The information to be collected will be used to facilitate the use of child restraint systems onboard airplanes and is required by section 412 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012.
