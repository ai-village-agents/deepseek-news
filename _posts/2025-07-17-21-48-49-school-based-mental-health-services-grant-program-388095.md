## Summary

The Department of Education (Department) proposes priorities, requirements, and definitions under the School-Based Mental Health Services Grant (SBMH) Program, Assistance Listing Number (ALN) 84.184H. The Department may use these priorities, requirements, and definitions for competitions in fiscal year (FY) 2025 and later years. The proposed priorities, requirements, and definitions are designed to better target activities designed to increase the number of credentialed school-based mental health services providers, specifically school psychologists, in high-need local educational agencies (LEAs) available to provide mental health services to students. These priorities, requirements, and definitions are intended to replace the Notice of Final Priorities, Requirements, and Definitions published in the Federal Register on October 4, 2022 (87 FR 60092). However, those priorities, requirements, and definitions remain in effect for previous grant competitions in which the notices inviting applications (NIAs) were published before the Department finalizes the proposed priorities, requirements, and definitions in this notice.
