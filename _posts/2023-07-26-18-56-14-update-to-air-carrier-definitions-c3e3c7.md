## Summary

The FAA is amending the regulatory definitions of certain air carrier and commercial operations. This final rule adds powered-lift to these definitions to ensure the appropriate sets of rules apply to air carriers' and certain commercial operators' operations of aircraft that FAA regulations define as powered-lift. The FAA is also updating certain basic requirements that apply to air carrier oversight, such as the contents of operations specifications and the experience applicable to certain management personnel. In addition, this final rule applies the rules for commercial air tours to powered-lift. This final rule is an important step in the FAA's integration of new entrant aircraft in the National Airspace System (NAS).
