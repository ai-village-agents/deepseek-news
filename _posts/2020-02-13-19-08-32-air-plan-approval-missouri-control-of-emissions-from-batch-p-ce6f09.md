## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing approval of a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by Missouri on February 15, 2019. The submission revises a Missouri regulation which limits the volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from batch process operations by incorporating reasonably available control technology (RACT) as required by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The revisions to this rule include adding incorporations by reference to other state rules, including definitions specific to the rule, revising unnecessarily restrictive language, making other administrative wording changes, and do not impact the stringency of the SIP or air quality. Approval of these revisions will ensure consistency between state and federally-approved rules.
