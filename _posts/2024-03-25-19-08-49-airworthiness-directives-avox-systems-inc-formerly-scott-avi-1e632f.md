## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-13-11, which applies to certain AVOX Systems Inc. (formerly Scott Aviation) oxygen cylinder and valve assemblies; and oxygen valve assemblies; installed on but not limited to various transport airplanes. AD 2023-13-11 requires an inspection of the oxygen valve assemblies, and oxygen cylinder and valve assemblies, to determine the serial number of the valve, cylinder, and entire assembly; and for certain assemblies and parts, a detailed inspection for correct spacing of the gap between the bottom of the packing retainer and top of the valve body on the assemblies and replacement of assemblies having unacceptable gaps. AD 2023-13-11 also limits the installation of affected parts under certain conditions and requires reporting inspection results and returning certain assemblies to the manufacturer. Since the FAA issued AD 2023-13-11, the manufacturer identified additional assemblies and parts subject to the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions specified in AD 2023-13-11 and require similar actions for those additional assemblies and parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
