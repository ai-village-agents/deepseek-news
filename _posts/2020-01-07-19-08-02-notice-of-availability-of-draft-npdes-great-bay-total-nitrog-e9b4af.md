## Summary

The Director of the Water Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency--Region 1 (EPA), is providing a Notice of Availability for the Draft National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Great Bay Total Nitrogen General Permit for certain discharges from Wastewater Treatment Facilities (WWTFs) to certain waters of the State of New Hampshire. This Draft NPDES Great Bay Total Nitrogen General Permit ("Draft General Permit") establishes effluent limitations and requirements, effluent and ambient monitoring requirements, reporting requirements and standard conditions for 13 eligible WWTFs in New Hampshire. The Draft General Permit is available on EPA Region 1's website at https://www.epa.gov/npdes-permits/draft- great-bay-total-nitrogen-general-permit. The Fact Sheet for the Draft General Permit sets forth principal facts and the significant factual, legal, methodological, and policy questions considered in the development of the Draft General Permit and is also available at this website. The Draft General Permit only authorizes the discharge of nitrogen from 13 eligible WWTFs. The discharge of all other pollutants from these WWTFs will continue to be authorized by each WWTF's respective individual NPDES permit.
