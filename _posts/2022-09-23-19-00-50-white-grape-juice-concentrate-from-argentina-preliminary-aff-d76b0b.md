## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) published a notice in the Federal Register on September 6, 2022, in which Commerce announced the preliminary affirmative determination in the countervailing duty (CVD) investigation of white grape juice concentrate (WGJC) from Argentina. In that notice, Commerce did not state that it is aligning the final CVD determination in this investigation with the final determination in the companion antidumping duty (AD) investigation of WGJC from Argentina. We are correcting this error with this notice, as described below.
