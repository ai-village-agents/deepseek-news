## Summary

The Coast Guard will enforce Seattle's Seafair Fleet Week moving vessels security zones from July 29, 2025 through August 5, 2025, to safeguard these vessels from destruction, loss, or injury from sabotage or other subversive acts, accidents, or events or a similar nature. The regulation for these security zones identifies all navigable waters within 500 yards of the designated participating vessels for the Parade of Ships in Elliott Bay, Seattle, Washington as the regulated areas for this event. During the enforcement periods no person or vessel may enter or remain in the established security zones without authorization from the Captain of the Port Sector Puget Sound (COTP) or their designated representative(s). The COTP has granted general permission for vessels to enter the outer 400 yards of the security zones provided they operate at the minimum speed necessary to maintain course unless required to maintain speed by the navigation rules.
