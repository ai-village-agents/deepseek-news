## Summary

This notice sets forth NHTSA's decision and reasons for denying a petition, Defect Petition (DP) (DP 13-001), submitted by Mr. William Rosenbluth (petitioner) in a January 23, 2013 letter to the Administrator of NHTSA (the "Agency"). The petitioner requested that the Agency open an investigation into the decoupling of the steering intermediate shaft assembly No. 2 from the steering column assembly on model year (MY) 2004-2009 Toyota Prius vehicles (the "Subject Vehicles"). After reviewing materials furnished by the petitioner, the manufacturer, and those already in its possession, NHTSA has concluded that the evidence does not warrant further investigation of the issue raised in the petition. The Agency accordingly has denied the petition.
