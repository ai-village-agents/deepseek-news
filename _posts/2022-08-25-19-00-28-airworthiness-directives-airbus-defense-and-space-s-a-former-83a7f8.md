## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-16- 07, which applied to certain Airbus Defense and Space S.A. Model C-212- CB, C-212-CC, C-212-CD, C-212-CE, C-212-CF, C-212-DE, and C-212-DF airplanes. AD 2021-16-07 required repetitive inspections of the left- hand (LH) and right-hand (RH) side center wing fairings at a certain frame, around the wing leading edge for discrepancies (cracks), and repair if necessary. This AD was prompted by a modification developed to reinforce the structure in the affected area, providing an optional terminating action for the repetitive inspections required by AD 2021- 16-07. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2021-16-07 and allows new optional terminating action for the repetitive inspections, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
