## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC, or Commission) is issuing an exemption in response to a September 29, 2022, request from TMI-2 Solutions, LLC (TMI-2 Solutions, or Licensee) for an exemption from NRC regulations. The action exempts TMI-2 Solutions from the requirements to maintain a radiation monitoring system in each area where licensed special nuclear material is handled, used, or stored that would energize clearly audible alarm signals if accidental criticality occurred during decommissioning. In evaluating the exemption request, the NRC staff determined that the Licensee's proposed decommissioning activities do not present any credible criticality hazards.
