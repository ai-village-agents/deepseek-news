## Summary

This proposed rule would establish minimum staffing standards for long-term care facilities, as part of the Biden-Harris Administration's Nursing Home Reform initiative to ensure safe and quality care in long-term care facilities. In addition, this rule proposes to require States to report the percent of Medicaid payments for certain Medicaid-covered institutional services that are spent on compensation for direct care workers and support staff.
