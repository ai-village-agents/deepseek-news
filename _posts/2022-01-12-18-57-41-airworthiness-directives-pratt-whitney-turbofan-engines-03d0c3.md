## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Pratt & Whitney (P&W) PW1500G and PW1900G model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by an analysis of an event involving an International Aero Engines AG (IAE) V2533-A5 model turbofan engine, which experienced an uncontained failure of a high-pressure turbine (HPT) 1st-stage disk that resulted in high-energy debris penetrating the engine cowling. This AD requires removing certain HPT 1st-stage and HPT 2nd-stage disks from service and replacing with parts eligible for installation. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
