## Summary

The Office of Natural Resources Revenue's (ONRR) regulations provide two types of accounting and auditing relief for Federal oil and gas production from marginal properties: the cumulative royalty reports and payments relief option, which allows a lessee or designee to submit one royalty report and payment for the calendar year's production; and other requested relief, which allows a lessee or designee to request any type of accounting and auditing relief that is appropriate for production from the marginal property and meets certain requirements. By October 1 of each calendar year, ONRR provides a list of qualifying marginal Federal oil and gas properties to the States receiving a portion of Federal royalties from those properties. Each State then decides whether to participate in neither, one, or both relief options. This notice provides the public each State's decision on whether to participate in marginal property relief.
