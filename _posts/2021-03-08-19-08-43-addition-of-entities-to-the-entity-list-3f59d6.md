## Summary

In this final rule, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to further implement U.S. sanctions on selected Burmese government ministries and related enterprises. Specifically, BIS amends the EAR by adding four entities to the Entity List under the destination of Burma. These four entities have been determined by the U.S. Government to be acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. The actions in this rule support the United States Government's efforts to promote a return to democracy in Burma following the February 1, 2021 Burmese military coup. They also reflect the United States Government's goal of supporting the people of Burma by preventing Burma' military and security services from obtaining items subject to the EAR.
