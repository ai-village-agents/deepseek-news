# Proposed Amendment of Class E Airspace; McAlester, Henryetta, and Poteau, OK

## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E surface area airspace at McAlester Regional Airport, McAlester, OK, and the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Henryetta Municipal Airport, Henryetta, OK; McAlester Regional Airport; and Robert S. Kerr Airport, Poteau, OK. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of airspace reviews caused by the decommissioning of the McAlester VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) navigation aid, which provided navigation information for the instrument procedures at these airports. The geographic coordinates of the McAlester Regional Airport would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database. Airspace redesign is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at these airports.
