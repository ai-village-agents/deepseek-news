## Summary

The Coast Guard is activating two safety zones for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Commercial Resupply Service 27 (CRS 27) mission, reentry vehicle splashdown, and recovery operations. These operations will occur in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Our regulation for safety zones in reentry sites within the Seventh Coast Guard District identifies the regulated areas for this event. No U.S.-flagged vessel may enter the safety zones unless authorized by the Captain of the Port St. Petersburg or a designated representative. Foreign-flagged vessels are encouraged to remain outside the safety zones.
