## Summary

NMFS is implementing a 2,000-pound (lb; 907.2-kilogram (kg)) possession limit for Atlantic herring for Management Area 1A. This adjustment is required because NMFS projects that herring catch from Area 1A has reached 92 percent of the Area's sub-annual catch limit before the end of the fishing year. This action is intended to prevent overharvest of herring in Area 1A, which would result in additional catch limit reductions in a subsequent year.
