## Summary

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) is amending official commentary interpreting requirements of the Bureau's Regulation C to reflect the asset-size exemption threshold for banks, savings associations, and credit unions based on the annual percentage change in the average of the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). Based on the 2.5 average percent increase in the CPI-W for the 12-month period ending November 2025, the exemption threshold is adjusted to $59 million from $58 million. Institutions with assets of $59 million or less as of December 31, 2025, are exempt from collecting data in 2026.
