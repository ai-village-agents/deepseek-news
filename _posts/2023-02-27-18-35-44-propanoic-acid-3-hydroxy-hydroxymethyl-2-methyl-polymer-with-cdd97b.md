## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of propanoic acid, 3-hydroxy- (hydroxymethyl)-2-methyl-, polymer with 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, [alpha]-hydro-[omega]-hydroxypoly[oxy(methyl-1,2-ethanediyl)], 5- isocyanato-1-(isocyanatomethyl)-1,3,3-trimethylcyclohexane and methyloxirane polymer with oxirane ether with 4,4'-(1- methylethylidene)bis[phenol] (2:1), polyethylene-polypropylene glycol 2-aminopropyl Me ether-blocked, compds. with 2-amino-2-methyl-1- propanol (IN-11729) when used as an inert ingredient in a pesticide chemical formulation. Nouryon Surface Chemistry LLC submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of propanoic acid, 3-hydroxy-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methyl-, polymer with 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, [alpha]-hydro-[omega]- hydroxypoly[oxy(methyl-1,2-ethanediyl)], 5-isocyanato-1- (isocyanatomethyl)-1,3,3-trimethylcyclohexane and methyloxirane polymer with oxirane ether with 4,4'-(1-methylethylidene)bis[phenol] (2:1), polyethylene-polypropylene glycol 2-aminopropyl Me ether-blocked, compds. with 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol on food or feed commodities when used in accordance with these exemptions.
