# Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA is withdrawing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) that would have applied to certain The Boeing Company Model 787-8 and 787-9 airplanes. The NPRM was prompted by a report that a passenger entry door assist handle became detached during use. The NPRM would have required a detailed inspection of all passenger and service entry door assist handles for correct installation and applicable on-condition actions. Since issuance of the NPRM, we determined that the service information is ineffective in addressing the unsafe condition and must be revised. Accordingly, the NPRM is withdrawn.
