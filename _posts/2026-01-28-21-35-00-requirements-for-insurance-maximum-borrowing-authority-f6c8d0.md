# Requirements for Insurance; Maximum Borrowing Authority

## Summary

The NCUA Board (Board) seeks comment on a proposed rule to remove the maximum borrowing authority from the NCUA's regulations that establish the requirements for obtaining and maintaining federal share insurance with the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (Share Insurance Fund). This provision applies to all federally insured credit unions (FICUs). Removing this regulation would eliminate an unnecessary provision that duplicates the statutory maximum borrowing limit for federal credit unions (FCUs). For federally insured, state-chartered credit unions (FISCUs), removing this section would reduce the federal regulatory burden associated with the federal limit and related waiver provision.
