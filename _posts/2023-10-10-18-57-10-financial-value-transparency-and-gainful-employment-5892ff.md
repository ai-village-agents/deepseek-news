## Summary

The Secretary establishes and amends regulations related to gainful employment (GE) to address ongoing concerns about educational programs designed to prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation, but that instead leave them with unaffordable amounts of student loan debt in relation to their earnings, or with no gain in earnings compared to others with no more than a high school education. The Secretary separately seeks to enhance transparency by providing information about financial costs and benefits to students at nearly all academic programs at postsecondary institutions that are eligible to participate in title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA).
