## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces a two-day convening hosted and facilitated by the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) to discuss hepatitis C diagnostics. Leaders from public health, laboratory, medical, academic, and industry sectors will have the opportunity to provide individual input, without building a consensus, on accelerating the diagnosis of current hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Members of the public with interest and expertise in diagnosing HCV infection are also invited to provide individual input. Specifically, the convening will focus on how to leverage the following hepatitis C diagnostic methods: same-day diagnosis and treatment, and viral-first testing.
