## Summary

This notice announces the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) has discontinued the information collection for both the Mink Survey (OMB Control Number 0535-0212) and the Agricultural Labor Survey (OMB Control Number 0535-0109), as these collections are deemed duplicative and/or no longer necessary. This action is taken under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) as part of the government's efforts to improve efficiency and eliminate unnecessary burdens.
