## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of mechanical noises originating from the nose landing gear (NLG) shock absorber during ground maneuvers. This AD requires repetitive inspections (i.e., steering checks) of the NLG shock absorber and applicable on-condition actions. This AD also limits the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
