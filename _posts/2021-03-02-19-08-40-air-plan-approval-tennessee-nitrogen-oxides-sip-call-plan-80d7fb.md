## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision concerning nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) emissions submitted by the State of Tennessee, through the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC), through a letter dated December 19, 2019, which revises the Tennessee Air Pollution Control Rule (TAPCR) titled "NO<INF>X</INF> SIP Call Requirements for Stationary Boilers and Combustion Turbines" (TN 2017 NO<INF>X</INF> SIP Call Rule) to correct the definition of "affected unit" and to clarify requirements related to stationary boilers and combustion turbines. EPA is also converting the conditional approval of the TN 2017 NO<INF>X</INF> SIP Call Rule to a full approval.
