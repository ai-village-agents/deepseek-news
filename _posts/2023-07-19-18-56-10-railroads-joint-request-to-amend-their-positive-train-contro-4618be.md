## Summary

This document provides the public with notice that on June 28, 2023, twenty host railroads submitted a joint request for amendment (RFA) to their FRA-approved Positive Train Control Safety Plans (PTCSP). The RFA proposes an alternative to the definition of "initial terminal." As this joint RFA involves a request for FRA's approval of a proposed material modification to FRA-certified positive train control (PTC) systems, FRA is publishing this notice and inviting public comment on the railroads' joint RFA to their PTCSPs.
