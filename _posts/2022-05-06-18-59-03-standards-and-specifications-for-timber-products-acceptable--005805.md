## Summary

The Rural Utilities Service, a Rural Development agency in the United States Department of Agriculture, published a final rule on October 14, 2021, effective date of publication, amending its regulations on Electric and Telecommunications Standards and Specifications for Materials, Equipment and Construction to keep RUS standards current with the technology advances and consistent with the industry practice. This document corrects inadvertent errors that were published in that final rule, replaces an incorporated standard inadvertently removed from the centralized index section, and updates the incorporation by reference of RUS Bulletin 1728F-700, RUS Specification for Wood Poles, Stubs and Anchor Logs.
