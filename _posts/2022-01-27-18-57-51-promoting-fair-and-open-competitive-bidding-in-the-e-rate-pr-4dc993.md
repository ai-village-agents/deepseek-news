## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) proposes a change to the E-Rate program targeted at several goals: Streamlining program requirements for applicants and service providers, strengthening program integrity, preventing improper payments, and decreasing the risk of fraud, waste, and abuse. Specifically, the Commission seeks comment on a proposal to implement a central document repository (i.e., bidding portal) through which service providers would be required to submit bids to the E-Rate program administrator, the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), instead of directly to applicants.
