The order would permit joint clearing members of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Inc. ("CME") and the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation ("FICC") that are dually registered as broker-dealers with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and futures commission merchants ("FCMs") with the Commission ("BD-FCMs") to hold futures customer funds in a commingled customer account at FICC.
