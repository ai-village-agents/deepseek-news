## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all International Aero Engines, LLC (IAE LLC) Model PW1122G-JM, PW1124G-JM, PW1124G1-JM, PW1127G-JM, PW1127G1-JM, PW1127G1A-JM, PW1127G1B-JM, PW1127GA-JM, PW1129G-JM, PW1130G-JM, PW1133G-JM, PW1133GA-JM, PW1428G- JM, PW1428GA-JM, PW1428GH-JM, PW1431G-JM, PW1431GA-JM, and PW1431GH-JM engines. This AD was prompted by multiple reports of fan blade fracture events, three of which resulted in an engine under cowl fire or pool fire. This AD requires removal of one loop cushion clamp from the hydraulic fuel pressure fuel oil cooler fuel tube assembly (CP09 tube assembly), replacement of the thermal management system (TMS) clevis mounts with redesigned TMS clevis mounts, and reinstallation of the loop cushion clamp, as applicable. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
