## Summary

Certain assistance contracts signed by owners participating in the Department's Section 8 housing assistance payment programs must provide annual adjustments to monthly rentals for units covered by the contracts. For owners subject to a Reserve for Replacement deposit requirement, HUD also requires that the amount of the required deposit be adjusted each year by the AAF. This notice announces FY 2026 AAFs for adjustment of contract rents on the anniversary of those assistance contracts. The factors are based on a formula using residential rent and utility cost changes from the most recent annual Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index (CPI) survey and market rents from a total of six possible private sector rent data sources. AAFs continue to be based on the shelter and gross rent inflation factors methodology used in HUD's Fair Market Rent calculation that was adopted in FY 2024.
