## Summary

This action proposes to amend Jet Route J-64; amend VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-50, V-71, V-216, and V- 307; amend Area Navigation (RNAV) route T-286; establish RNAV route T- 468; and revoke J-130, J-192, V-553, and the Pawnee City, NE, low altitude reporting point. The FAA is proposing this action due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Pawnee City, NE, VOR/ Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) navigational aid (NAVAID). The Pawnee City VOR is being decommissioned in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
