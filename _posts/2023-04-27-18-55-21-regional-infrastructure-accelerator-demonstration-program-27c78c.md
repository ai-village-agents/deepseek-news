## Summary

The Build America Bureau (the Bureau) is issuing this NOFO to solicit applications from eligible parties for $24 million in Regional Infrastructure Accelerator (RIA) grants. RIA grants assist entities in developing improved infrastructure priorities and financing strategies for the accelerated development of a project that is eligible for funding under the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) Credit Program under Chapter 6 of Title 23, United States Code. These grants are intended to support RIAs that: (1) serve a defined geographic area; (2) act as a resource to qualified entities in the geographic area; and (3) demonstrate the effectiveness of the RIA to expedite the delivery of projects eligible for the TIFIA credit program. Projects are not required to apply for or receive TIFIA credit assistance to be eligible; however, applicants who are considering the appropriateness of innovative financing methods to accelerate the delivery of eligible projects are strongly encouraged to apply.
