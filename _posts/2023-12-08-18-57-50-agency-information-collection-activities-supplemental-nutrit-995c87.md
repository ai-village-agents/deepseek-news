## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice invites the general public and other public agencies to comment on this proposed revision to the currently approved information collection for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) form FNS-889, "SNAP Education (SNAP-Ed) Connection Resource Sharing Form." This revision to the information collection will improve the submission process by clarifying the information requested for certain fields, thus providing data that is accurate and beneficial to stakeholders using the resource. These updates will also align with the new SNAP-Ed National Program Evaluation and Reporting System (N-PEARS) (OMB Control #0584-0683, expiration 4/30/2026), to ensure consistency with SNAP-Ed specific terms. With this update to form FNS-889, FNS has determined that nutrition and physical activity interventions (i.e., educational materials, curricula, etc.), will no longer be accepted through this information collection.
