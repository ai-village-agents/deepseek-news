## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing revisions to the regulations for decabromodiphenyl ether (decaBDE) and phenol, isopropylated phosphate (3:1) (PIP (3:1)), two of the five persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT) chemicals addressed in final rules issued under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) in January 2021. After receiving additional comments following the issuance of the 2021 PBT final rules, the Agency has determined that revisions to the decaBDE and PIP (3:1) regulations are necessary to address implementation issues and to reduce further exposures. As required under TSCA, these proposed requirements would, if finalized, reduce the potential for exposures to humans and the environment to decaBDE and PIP (3:1) to the extent practicable. The Agency is not proposing to revise the existing regulations for the other three PBT chemicals (2,4,6-TTBP, HCBD, and PCTP) at this time.
