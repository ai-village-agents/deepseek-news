## Summary

The Forest Service invites public comment on the framework, focus, and direction of its Wildfire Crisis Implementation Plan associated with the Wildfire Crisis Strategy and specific provisions of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, 2021. This Implementation Plan differs from a land management plan, which is a requirement of the National Forest Management Act. The Wildfire Crisis Implementation Plan will provide a cross-jurisdictional blueprint for coordination, collaboration and funding of restoration treatments specifically designed to reduce wildfire risk to people, communities, and natural resources in high priority, at-risk landscapes. It is intended to be a living document informed by public engagement and outreach, and projects/actions will comply with National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) accordingly. We invite public comment on specific elements of the Implementation Plan, per questions outlined below. Comments will be considered in further developing and refining approaches taken by the Forest Service.
