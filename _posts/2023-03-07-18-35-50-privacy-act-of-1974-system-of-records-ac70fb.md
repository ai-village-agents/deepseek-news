## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is giving notice that it proposes to modify a system of records pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. The Mass Alert Notification System (MANS) is being modified to update the system location, contact information, and record source categories, and to add one additional General Routine Use. The purpose of the system is to manage communications to agency personnel during critical events. EPA uses MANS for operational response to critical events to keep individuals safe and ensure continuity of business operations. During public safety threats such as active shooter situations, terrorist attacks, or severe weather conditions, as well as critical business events such as IT outages, cyber-attacks, or other incidents such as product recalls or supply-chain interruptions, customers rely on MANS to quickly and reliably aggregate and assess threat data, locate people at risk and responders able to assist, automate the execution of pre-defined communications processes, and track progress on executing incident response plans.
