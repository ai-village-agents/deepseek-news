## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing amendments to the Standards of Performance for Industrial Surface Coating of Plastic Parts for Business Machines as the preliminary results of the review of the new source performance standards required by the Clean Air Act. Specific to affected facilities that commence construction, modification, or reconstruction after June 21, 2022, the EPA is, in new subpart TTTa, proposing volatile organic compound (VOC) emission limitations for prime, color, texture, and touch-up coating operations. We are also proposing in subparts TTTa and TTT to include a requirement for electronic submission of periodic compliance reports.
