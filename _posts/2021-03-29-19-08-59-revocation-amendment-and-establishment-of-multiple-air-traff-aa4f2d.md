## Summary

This action withdraws the final rule published in the Federal Register on August 20, 2020, removing Jet Route J-590, amending VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-11 and V-70, and establishing area navigation (RNAV) routes T-362 and T-365 due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Greene County, MS, VOR/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) navigation aid. Unanticipated issues affecting the completion of related VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program instrument procedure amendments and the associated flight inspection activities required to adopt those amendments continue and have made this withdrawal action necessary.
