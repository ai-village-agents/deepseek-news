## Summary

The Department of State ("Department") finalizes regulations regarding the publication, coordination, and reporting of international agreements. Section 5947 of the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 made changes regarding the reporting to Congress and publication of the texts of international agreements and related information. The amendments include changes to the scope and deadlines associated with requirements to report international agreements and related information to Congress, and to publish the texts of international agreements in the Treaties and Other International Acts Series (TIAS). These amendments are intended to reflect and to implement the recently enacted changes to the reporting process.
