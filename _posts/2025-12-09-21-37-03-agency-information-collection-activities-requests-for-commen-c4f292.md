## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to revise and renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on June 24, 2025. The collection involves a security holder completing an AC Form 8050-98, Aircraft Security Agreement and returning a completed AC Form 8050-41, Notice of Recordation--Aircraft Security Conveyance with Part II--Release to the Civil Aviation Registry, Aircraft Registration Branch (Registry). The information is used to record a security interest in an aircraft and eligible engines, propellers, and spare parts and release that interest when the debt is satisfied.
