## Summary

This action proposes to amend United States Area Navigation (RNAV) T-route, T-260 in the vicinity of Nome, AK. The RNAV amendments are necessary due to the planned decommissioning of the Tin City, AK, (TNC) Non-Directional Beacons (NDB)/Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) and the Point Hope, AK, (PHO) NDB. Both NDBs will decommission as part of a large and comprehensive T-route modernization project for the state of Alaska. Although the Tin City, AK, (TNC) NDB will decommission, the co-located Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) will remain for use within the National Airspace System (NAS).
