# Airworthiness Directives; Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation Model G-1159A, G-1159B and all G-IV, and GIV-X airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that the ground spoiler actuator installation allows improper hydraulic line connections that could result in unintended asymmetrical spoiler deployment. This proposed AD would require incorporating corrective actions that physically prevent improper connection of the hydraulic lines to the ground spoiler actuator. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
