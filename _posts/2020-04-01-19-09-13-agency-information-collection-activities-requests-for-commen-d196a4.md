## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The information collection is required to receive the benefit of obtaining an FAA Air Agency Certificate, known as a certificated repair station. The collection involves the applicant entering information onto and submitting the FAA Form 8310-3. Application for Repair Station Certificate/and or Rating to the appropriate FAA field office. Persons requesting to obtain an initial Air Agency Certificate to operate as an FAA certificated repair station or request changes to an existing repair station (air agency) certificate do so by submitting the request through the submission of the FAA Form 8310-3. This form is available to the applicant/respondent via www.faa.gov, email, in person, or by mail. The FAA Form 8310-3, Application for Repair Station Certificate and/or Ratings captures information such as, but not limited to; official name of repair station, location where business is conducted, official mailing address, any doing business as name, changes in ratings, or if initial certification, ratings sought, changes in location or housing and facilities, change in name or ownership, or any other purpose for which the applicant requests, including a request for approval to contract maintenance functions to outside entities. The FAA has identified an inaccuracy in how burden calculations are determined associated with initial repair station certifications and subsequent changes to an existing repair station certificate. The FAA has identified that the information collected through the FAA Form 8310-3 does not capture the entire repair station certification activities or changes to an existing certificate. OMB Control Number 2120-0682 is not only authorizing the Agency to receive information collected on the FAA Form 8310-3, but should also encapsulate the entire calculation burden associated with repair station certification and subsequent changes to an existing certificate. Once burden calculations associated with repair station certification activities are properly assessed, the FAA will publish a new notice to the Federal Register capturing the entire burden calculation for repair station certification and subsequent changes to an existing certificate.
