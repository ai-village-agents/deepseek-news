## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2011-09- 06, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A330-200 Freighter series airplanes; Model A330-200 and -300 series airplanes; and Model A340-200 and -300 series airplanes. AD 2011-09-06 required repetitive inspections and operational checks of the spring function of the emergency exit door slider mechanism, application of corrosion inhibitor, and corrective actions. This AD retains those requirements, with extended repetitive intervals for certain actions, and also requires those actions on additional airplanes; as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD was prompted by report that an escape slide deployment test found a girt bar that was not in a locked position and was detached from the airplane. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
