## Summary

The Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), is requesting a three-year extension of the National Medical Support Notice (NMSN) Part A. This request includes minor revisions to the NMSN Part A form, revisions to and separation of the instructions into a stand-alone attachment, a Part A sample, and the addition of the State Medical Support Contacts and Program Requirements matrix. To allow states to program the changes to the proposed NMSN Part A, OCSE also requests an extension of the current version of the NMSN Part A for an additional year. The current Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval expires on October 31, 2022.
