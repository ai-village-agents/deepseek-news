## Summary

We, NMFS, have completed a comprehensive status review of the Oregon Coast (OC) and Southern Oregon and Northern California Coastal (SONCC) Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs) in response to a petition to list these species as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and to designate critical habitat concurrently with the listings. Based on the best scientific and commercial information available, including the status review report, and taking into account efforts being made to protect the species, we have determined that the OC and SONCC Chinook salmon ESUs do not warrant listing.
