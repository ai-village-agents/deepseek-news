## Summary

On October 21, 2021, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau or CFPB) ordered six large technology companies operating payments systems in the United States to provide information about certain of their business practices. Accompanying the orders, the Director of the Bureau issued a statement and invited interested parties to submit comments to inform the Bureau's inquiry. The statement and request for comment was published in the Federal Register on November 5, 2021, in a document titled, "Notice and Request for Comment Regarding the CFPB's Inquiry into Big Tech Payment Platforms." The Bureau has determined that it is appropriate to re-open the docket for 30 days from Federal Register publication and add two questions.
