## Summary

The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeks comment on a proposal for reviewing contracts negotiated between the Postal Service and customers for competitive services. These contracts are known as competitive negotiated service agreements (NSAs). The proposal includes a default method for reviewing competitive NSAs and three optional streamlined methods. Different requirements apply to each method for reviewing proposed competitive NSAs. In addition, the proposal includes requirements for administering approved competitive NSAs. The proposal is designed to streamline competitive NSA review, ensure transparency and accountability, preserve existing flexibility, and enable a smooth transition with minimum disruption for stakeholders. This document informs the public of the filing, invites public comment, and takes other administrative steps.
