## Summary

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing a final rule to abolish the special wage schedule pay plan practice previously established for nonsupervisory and supervisory ship surveyor positions in Puerto Rico. The Department of the Navy no longer has such positions in Puerto Rico. This change is based on a consensus recommendation of the Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee (FPRAC).
