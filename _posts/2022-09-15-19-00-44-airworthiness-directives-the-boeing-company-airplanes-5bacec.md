## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2007-10-04, which applies to all McDonnell Douglas Model DC-9-81 (MD- 81), DC-9-82 (MD-82), DC-9-83 (MD-83), DC-9-87 (MD-87), and MD-88 airplanes. AD 2007-10-04 requires repetitive inspections to detect cracks in the horizontal stabilizer, and related investigative and corrective actions if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2007-10-04, it has been determined that certain compliance times and repetitive intervals must be reduced to address the unsafe condition. This proposed AD continues to require the actions specified in AD 2007-10-04 with revised compliance times for certain actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
