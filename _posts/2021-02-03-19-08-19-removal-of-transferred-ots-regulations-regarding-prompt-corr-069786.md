## Summary

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is adopting a final rule to rescind and remove from the Code of Federal Regulations rules entitled "Prompt Corrective Action" that were transferred to the FDIC from the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) on July 21, 2011, in connection with the implementation of Title III of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) and amend certain sections of existing FDIC regulations governing the issuance and review of orders pursuant to the prompt corrective action provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to make it clear that such rules apply to all insured depository institutions for which the FDIC is the appropriate Federal banking agency.
