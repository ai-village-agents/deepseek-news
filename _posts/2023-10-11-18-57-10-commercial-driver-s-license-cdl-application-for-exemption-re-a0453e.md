## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to provisionally renew a U.S. Custom Harvesters, Inc. (USCHI) exemption from the "K" intrastate restriction on commercial driver's licenses (CDLs) for custom harvester drivers operating in interstate commerce for a two-year period, with additional terms and conditions. FMCSA's regulations currently provide an exception to the minimum age requirements for drivers of commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) controlled and operated by a person engaged in interstate custom harvesting. However, under the Agency's CDL regulations, States may include an intrastate-only (or "K") restriction for these drivers. This provisional renewal of the exemption continues relief from the CDL provision for two years.
