## Summary

The U.S. Department of Transportation (Department or DOT) is amending its regulations regarding the hearing procedures that are available when the Department proposes a discretionary aviation consumer protection rulemaking declaring a practice to be unfair or deceptive. This final rule simplifies the hearing procedures and allows the Department greater flexibility to conduct a hearing in a manner that would not unduly delay the aviation consumer protection rulemaking.
