## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its regulations by adding a new class exemption from licensing and associated distribution requirements. This new class exemption would create a path for licensing current and future products that contain byproduct material incidental to their production. This rulemaking would resolve a petition for rulemaking submitted by GE Osmonics, Inc., that requested changes to the regulations to allow distribution of polycarbonate track etched membranes. The NRC plans to hold a public meeting to promote full understanding of the proposed rule and facilitate public comments.
