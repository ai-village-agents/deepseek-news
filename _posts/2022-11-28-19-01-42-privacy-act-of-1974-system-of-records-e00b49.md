## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Transportation (DOT) proposes to establish a new system of records (hereafter referred to as "Notice") titled, "Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration DOT/FAA 855 Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) Aviation and Space Education (AVSED) Outreach Program." This system of records allows the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to collect, use, maintain, and disseminate the records needed for students, parents, teachers, and other similar educators to register for outreach events and contests that are hosted by the FAA. This includes collecting, using, maintaining, and disseminating information when complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), 15 U.S.C. 6501-6506 (2001) requirement to obtain parental consent. Additionally, this system of records will provide FAA with a means to document participation, and completion of FAA outreach events and contests.
