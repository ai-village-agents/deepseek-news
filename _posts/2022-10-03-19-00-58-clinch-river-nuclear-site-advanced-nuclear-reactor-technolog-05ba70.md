## Summary

This notice is provided in accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality's regulations and Tennessee Valley Authority's (TVA's) procedures for implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). TVA has selected the Preferred Alternative identified in the Clinch River Nuclear (CRN) Site Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technology Park Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS). The Notice of Availability of the Final PEIS for the Clinch River Nuclear Site Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technology Park was published in the Federal Register on July 29, 2022. The Preferred Alternative, Alternative D--Nuclear Technology Park at Area 1 and Area 2 with Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and/or Advanced Non-Light Water Reactors (Non-LWRs), provides the necessary flexibility in achieving the purpose and need of the project to support TVA's goal of demonstrating the feasibility of deploying advanced nuclear reactor technologies at the CRN Site capable of incrementally supplying clean, secure, and reliable power that is less vulnerable to disruption. As defined in the PEIS, advanced reactors can include non-LWRs and LWRs. SMRs are a type of advanced LWR reactor with an electrical output of generally no more than 300 megawatts electric (MWe).
