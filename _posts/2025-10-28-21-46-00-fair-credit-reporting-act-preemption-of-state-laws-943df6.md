## Summary

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) is issuing this interpretive rule to clarify that the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) generally preempts State laws that touch on broad areas of credit reporting, consistent with Congress's intent to create national standards for the credit reporting system. This interpretive rule replaces a July 2022 interpretive rule that the Bureau withdrew in May 2025.
