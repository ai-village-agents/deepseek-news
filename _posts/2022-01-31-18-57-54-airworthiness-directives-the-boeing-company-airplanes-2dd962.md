## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 747-8F series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of fuselage crown stringer cracking between station (STA) 740 and STA 1000, stringer (S)-7 to S-12. This proposed AD would require repetitive detailed inspections for cracking of fuselage crown stringers and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
