## Summary

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB or Bureau) is issuing this advisory opinion to affirm that, when preparing consumer reports, a consumer reporting agency that reports public record information is not using reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy under section 607(b) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) if it does not have certain procedures in place. For example, it must have procedures that prevent reporting of information that is duplicative or that has been expunged, sealed, or otherwise legally restricted from public access. This advisory opinion also highlights certain aspects of the reporting period for adverse items under FCRA section 605(a)(5).
