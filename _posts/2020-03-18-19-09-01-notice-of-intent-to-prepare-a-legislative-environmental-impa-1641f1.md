## Summary

The United States Air Force (USAF) (co-lead agency), in coordination with the United States Marine Corps (USMC) (co-lead agency), is issuing this notice to advise the public of the intent to prepare a Legislative Environmental Impact Statement (LEIS) for the proposed extension of the Barry M. Goldwater Range (BMGR) land withdrawal and reservation in Arizona. The LEIS will also address a proposal to withdrawal approximately 2,366 acres of additional public land adjacent to Gila Bend Air Force Auxiliary Airfield to enhance the security and safety of flight operations at the airfield. Five public scoping meetings will be held, which is an important part of the LEIS process as it allows for an early and open process, giving the public an opportunity to help determine the scope of issues and alternatives to be addressed in the LEIS.
