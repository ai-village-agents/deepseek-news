## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of broken lower attachment studs on the AFT galley complex. This proposed AD would require repetitive detailed inspections of the lower attachment studs and, depending on findings, replacement of the lower attachment studs, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
