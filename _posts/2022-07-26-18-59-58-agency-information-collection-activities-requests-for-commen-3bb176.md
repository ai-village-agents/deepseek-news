## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for a new information collection. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Support Center Case Management System (CMS) is being created to help streamline how stakeholders' questions are answered in a timely manner. Specifically, the Contact Customer Support form allows the public and other stakeholders to ask the FAA questions, as well as get the appropriate answer or information they need to operate their UAS or drone safely. The UAS Support Center has a publicly available form to submit inquiries. This form would be replacing the current web form to be used within the Salesforce solutions that allows UAS Integration Office additional technology to more efficient and streamline the UAS Support center business process. This form would allow the UAS Integration Office to collect the appropriate information about the stakeholder's name, preferred method of communications email address, phone number, zip code, type of flyer that would allow the Support Center Analysts to answer the customer's specific question more efficiently.
