## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing Supplement 1 to a final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS), NUREG- 2237, "Environmental Impact Statement for the Holtec International's License Application for a Consolidated Interim Storage Facility for Spent Nuclear Fuel in Lea County, New Mexico." Supplement 1 to NUREG- 2237 updates the responses to public comments by adding responses to certain comments that were inadvertently not included in the FEIS. Supplement 1 does not include any changes to impact analysis or determinations. Holtec International (Holtec) has requested a license to construct and operate a consolidated interim storage facility (CISF) for spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and Greater-Than-Class C (GTCC) waste, along with a small quantity of mixed oxide (MOX) fuel. The proposed CISF would be located in southeast New Mexico at a site located approximately halfway between the cities of Carlsbad and Hobbs. The proposed action is the issuance of an NRC license authorizing a CISF to store up to 8,680 metric tons of uranium (MTUs) [9,568 short tons] of SNF in 500 canisters for a license period of 40 years.
