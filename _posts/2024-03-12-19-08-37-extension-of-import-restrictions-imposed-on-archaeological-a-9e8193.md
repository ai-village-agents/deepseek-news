## Summary

This document amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regulations to extend import restrictions on certain archaeological and ecclesiastical ethnological material from Honduras. The Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States Department of State, has made the requisite determinations for extending the import restrictions, which were originally imposed by CBP Decision (CBP Dec.) 04-08 and last extended by CBP Dec. 19-03. The United States and Honduras have also agreed to extend the restrictions for an additional five-year period. Accordingly, these import restrictions will remain in effect for an additional five years, and the CBP regulations are being amended to reflect this further extension through March 12, 2029.
