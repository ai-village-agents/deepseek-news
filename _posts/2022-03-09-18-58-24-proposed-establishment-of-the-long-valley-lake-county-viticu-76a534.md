## Summary

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to establish the approximately 7,605-acre "Long Valley-Lake County" viticultural area in Lake County, California. Additionally, TTB proposes to expand the boundary of the established 14,000-acre High Valley viticultural area by approximately 1,542 acres in order to create a contiguous border with the proposed Long Valley-Lake County viticultural area. Only the western third of the proposed Long Valley-Lake County viticultural area, and approximately three quarters of the High Valley viticultural area, would lie within the established, multi-county North Coast viticultural area. To avoid this partial overlap with the High Valley and proposed Long Valley-Lake County viticultural areas, TTB is proposing to expand the boundary of the North Coast viticultural area by approximately 23,690 acres. TTB designates viticultural areas to allow vintners to better describe the origin of their wines and to allow consumers to better identify wines they may purchase. TTB invites comments on these proposals.
