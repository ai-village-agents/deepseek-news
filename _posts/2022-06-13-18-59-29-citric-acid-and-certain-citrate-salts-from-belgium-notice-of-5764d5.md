## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is initiating a changed circumstances review of the antidumping duty (AD) order on citric acid and certain citrate salts (citric acid) from Belgium. Further, Commerce preliminarily determines that Citribel nv (Citribel) is the successor-in-interest to S.A. Citrique Belge N.V. (Citrique Belge) and should be assigned the same AD cash deposit rate for purposes of the AD order. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.
