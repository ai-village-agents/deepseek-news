## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to partially approve and partially disapprove the Arizona state implementation plan (SIP) as meeting the requirements of sections 110(a)(1) and 110(a)(2) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) for the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of the 2015 ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or "standards"). Section 110(a)(1) requires that each state adopt and submit a SIP for the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of each NAAQS promulgated by the EPA, and that the EPA act on such SIPs. We refer to such SIPs as "infrastructure" SIPs because they are intended to address basic structural SIP requirements for new or revised NAAQS including, but not limited to, legal authority, regulatory structure, resources, permit programs, monitoring, and modeling necessary to assure attainment and maintenance of the standards. In addition to our proposed partial approval and partial disapproval of Arizona's infrastructure SIP, the EPA is proposing to approve rules in the Arizona Revised Statutes and Pima County Code related to public availability of emissions reports into the Arizona SIP. Lastly, the EPA is proposing to reclassify regions in Arizona with respect to episode plans for ozone under 40 CFR 51.150. The EPA is seeking public comments on this proposed action and will accept comments from the public on this proposal for the next 30 days.
