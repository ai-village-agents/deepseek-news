## Summary

This regulation amends the existing tolerance exemption for residues of Aspergillus flavus strain AF36 by establishing an exemption for use on all food and feed commodities of cotton, corn, pistachio, almond, and fig when used in accordance with label directions and good agricultural practices. Interregional Research Project Number 4 (IR-4) submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting to amend the existing tolerance exemption for Aspergillus flavus strain AF36. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of Aspergillus flavus strain AF36 under FFDCA when used in accordance with the amended tolerance exemption.
