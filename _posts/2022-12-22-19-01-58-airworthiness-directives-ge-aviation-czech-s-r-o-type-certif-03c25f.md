## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain GE Aviation Czech s.r.o. (GEAC) M601D-11, M601E-11, M601E-11A, M601E-11AS, M601E-11S, M601F, H75-100, H75-200, H80, H80-100, H80-200, H85-100, and H85-200 model turboprop engines. This AD was prompted by reports of cracks in dilution tube weld areas of the combustion chamber outer liner. This AD requires initial and repetitive borescope inspections (BSIs) of the dilution tube weld areas of the combustion chamber outer liner and, depending on the results of the inspections, replacement of the combustion chamber outer liner with a part eligible for installation. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
