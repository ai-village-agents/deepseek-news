## Summary

This final rule amends the Department of Homeland Security REAL ID regulations by making non-substantive technical revisions to two provisions that incorporate standards by reference. It also consolidates and updates the standardized incorporation by reference approval language into one centralized section for this part. This action is editorial in nature and does not impose any new regulatory requirements on affected parties.
