## Summary

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Children's Bureau (CB) is seeking public comment, in particular from State and Tribal title IV-B agencies and Indian Tribes, Tribal organizations and consortia (Tribes), and State and Tribal courts on providing technical assistance related to the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA), removing undue burden related to meeting the requirements of title IV-B of the Social Security Act (the Act), changes to the Court Improvement Program, and amendments aimed at increasing the number of studies of programs and services eligible for review by the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse. ACF is issuing this Federal Register Notice in response to requirements in the Supporting America's Children and Families Act, Public Law 118-258. The comments ACF receives in response will inform ACF's work to meet the new requirements in Public Law 118- 258. ACF is also planning to hold consultation with Tribes later this year on these topics and will announce that through Dear Tribal Leader Letters. This Federal Register Notice is in addition to ongoing ACF consultation with Tribes, including consultation on title IV-B provisions not included in this Notice.
