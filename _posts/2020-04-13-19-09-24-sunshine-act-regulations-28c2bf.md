## Summary

Under the Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development (BUILD) Act of 2018, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) adopted the regulations of its predecessor, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). One of these regulations implemented the Sunshine Act, which is not applicable to DFC. Accordingly, to ensure DFC is implementing and complying with applicable regulations, this final rule removes the agency's Sunshine Act regulations.
