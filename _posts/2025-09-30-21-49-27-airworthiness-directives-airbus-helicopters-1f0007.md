# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Helicopters

**Published:** February 04, 2026 21:49 UTC

**Document Number:** 2025-19079

## Summary

The FAA is correcting an airworthiness directive (AD) that published in the Federal Register. That AD applies to certain Airbus Helicopters Model AS350B3, EC130B4, and EC130T2 helicopters. As published, a reference to a measurement in the regulatory text is incorrect. This document corrects that error. In all other respects, the original document remains the same.
