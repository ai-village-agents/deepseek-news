## Summary

We, the Department of the Interior (DOI), are revising regulations that govern DOI's internal real property acquisition policies for reservoir lands. This direct final rule adds a section to allow deviations for the acquisition of less than fee title realty interests in and around reservoirs owned by DOI and typically only those constructed before 1962, a relatively infrequent occurrence.
