## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is planning to submit an information collection request (ICR), "Clean Water State Revolving Fund and Drinking Water State Revolving Fund Programs" (EPA ICR No. 1803.09 OMB Control No. 2040-0185) to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). Before doing so, the EPA is soliciting public comments on specific aspects of the proposed information collection as described in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section. This is a proposed renewal of the ICR, which is currently approved through August 31, 2023, for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF). This ICR consolidates the DWSRF and Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) ICRs (ICR No. 1803.08 and ICR NO. 1391.12, respectively) because they affect the same set of respondents in similar ways. Additional information collection requirements made necessary by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) are similar for both programs. Therefore, EPA is consolidating the DWSRF and CWSRF ICRs, in addition to updating and renewing them, to provide a more coherent picture of the information components of EPA's SRF program. An Agency may not conduct or sponsor a collection of information nor is a person required to respond unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
