This notice invites comment on a continuing information collection project titled Annual Submission of the Ingredients Added to, and the Quantity of Nicotine Contained in, Smokeless Tobacco Manufactured, Imported, or Packaged in the U.S. This activity is designed to allow CDC to collect a list of ingredients added to tobacco in the manufacture of smokeless tobacco products and a specification of the quantity of nicotine contained in each product.
