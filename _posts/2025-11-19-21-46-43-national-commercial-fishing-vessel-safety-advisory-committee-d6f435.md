## Summary

The U. S. Coast Guard is resoliciting applications from persons interested in membership on the National Commercial Fishing Safety Advisory Committee (Committee). On June 17, 2025, the Coast Guard published in the Federal Register (90 FR 25621, Docket No. USCG- 2025-0148) an announcement that we were soliciting applications for membership on the Committee. We did not receive a sufficient number of applications overall, nor did we receive any applications for three (3) vacancies for representatives of the commercial fishing industry and one (1) vacancy for a representative of the manufacturers of equipment of vessels for which Chapter 45 of Title 46 of the United States Code applies. Therefore, we are resoliciting for applications for all eighteen (18) vacancies. We particularly encourage applications from representatives of the commercial fishing industry and equipment manufacturers.
