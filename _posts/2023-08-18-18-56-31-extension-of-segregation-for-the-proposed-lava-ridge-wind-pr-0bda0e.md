## Summary

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Shoshone Field Office announces the extension of the segregation of 106,555.88 acres of public lands for the Lava Ridge Wind Project (project) for an additional two years, subject to valid existing rights. The public land involved will be segregated from appropriation under the public land laws, including the Mining Law of 1872, but not the mineral leasing or material sale laws. This segregation extension is necessary to allow for the orderly administration of the public lands and to facilitate the completion of the BLM's review and decision regarding the project.
