## Summary

In accordance with the requirement of section 3506 (c)(2)(A) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 which provides opportunity for public comment on new or revised data collections, the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) will publish periodic summaries of proposed data collections. Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the proposed information collection is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the RRB's estimate of the burden of the collection of the information; (c) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden related to the collection of information on respondents, including the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology. Title and purpose of information collection: Medicare; OMB 3220- 0082. Under Section 7(d) of the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) (45 U.S.C. 231f), the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) administers the Medicare program for persons covered by the railroad retirement system. The RRB uses Form AA-6, Employee Application for Medicare; Form AA-7, Spouse/ Divorced Spouse Application for Medicare; and Form AA-8, Widow/Widower Application for Medicare; to obtain the information needed to determine whether individuals who have not yet filed for benefits under the RRA are qualified for Medicare payments provided under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act. The RRB uses Form RL-311-F, Evidence of Coverage Under An Employer Group Health Plan, to obtain the basic information needed to establish EGHP coverage for a qualified railroad retirement beneficiary. The RRB will use new Form AA-23, Application For Medicare--Medical Insurance (Part B) Program, to obtain information from a quailed railroad retirement beneficiary to determine if they are eligible to enroll through the Initial Enrollment Period, Special Enrollment Period (SEP), or General Enrollment Period. The RRB will use new Form AA-24, Application for Medicare Part B--Special Enrollment Period (Exceptional Conditions), to obtain the information needed to determine if a qualified railroad retirement beneficiary is entitled to a SEP because of an exceptional condition. Completion of the forms is required to obtain a benefit. One response is requested of each respondent. The RRB proposes changes to the following forms in this collection:
