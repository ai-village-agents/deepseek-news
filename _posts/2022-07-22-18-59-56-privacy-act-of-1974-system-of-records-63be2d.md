## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) proposes to establish a new DHS system of records titled, "DHS/CBP-027 Customs Broker Management (CBM)." The records in this system are currently covered under the "DHS/CBP-010 Persons Engaged in International Trade in Customs and Border Protection Licensed/Regulated Activities Systems of Records" and historically under the "Treasury/ CS.069 Customs Brokers File". DHS/CBP is creating this new System of Records Notice (SORN) to distinguish the Customs Broker application and exam, license, and vetting records from the other records in "DHS/CBP- 010 Persons Engaged in International Trade in Customs and Border Protection Licensed/Regulated Activities Systems of Records". This newly established system will be included in DHS's inventory of record systems.
