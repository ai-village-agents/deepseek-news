## Summary

This proposed rule would implement recommendations from the National Potato Promotion Board (Board) to change its membership and organization by revising the formula used to determine the number of producer and importer seats on the Board, reducing the maximum number of importer seats on the Board, and indefinitely suspending the Administrative Committee. In addition to these Board-recommended changes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) would make several non-substantive changes to clarify the start of the term of office for Board members and modernize the Board's procedures. The Board administers the Potato Research and Promotion Plan (Plan) with oversight by the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS).
