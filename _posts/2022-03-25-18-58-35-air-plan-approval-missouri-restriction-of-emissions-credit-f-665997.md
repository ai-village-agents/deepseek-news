## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing approval of a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Missouri on January 30, 2020. Missouri requests that the EPA approve revisions to a State regulation that limits the use of dispersion techniques to meet ambient air quality standards in the vicinity of major sources of air pollution. The use of certain dispersion techniques is prohibited by section 123 of the Clean Air Act (CAA). The revisions to the rule are a revised restructured version of the same rule. These revisions are administrative in nature and do not impact the stringency of the SIP or air quality. The EPA's proposed approval of this rule revision is in accordance with the requirements of the CAA.
