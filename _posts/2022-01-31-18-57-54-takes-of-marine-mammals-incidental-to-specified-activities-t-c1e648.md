## Summary

NMFS has received a request from BNSF Railway (BNSF) for authorization to take marine mammals incidental to a Railway Bridge Heavy Maintenance Project in King County, Washington. Pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), NMFS is requesting comments on its proposal to issue two consecutive incidental harassment authorization (IHAs) to incidentally take marine mammals during the specified activities. NMFS is also requesting comments on possible one-time, one- year renewals for each IHA that could be issued under certain circumstances and if all requirements are met, as described in Request for Public Comments at the end of this notification. NMFS will consider public comments prior to making any final decision on the issuance of the requested MMPA authorizations and agency responses will be summarized in the final notice of our decision.
