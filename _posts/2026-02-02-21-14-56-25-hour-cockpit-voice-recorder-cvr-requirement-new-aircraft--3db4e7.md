## Summary

This final rule increases the recording time of cockpit voice recorders (CVRs) from the currently mandated 2 hours to 25 hours for all affected future manufactured aircraft. This action provides accident investigators, aircraft operators, and civil aviation authorities with substantially more CVR data to help determine the probable causes of incidents and accidents and prevent future incidents and accidents. The action will also align the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) regulations more closely with existing international requirements.
