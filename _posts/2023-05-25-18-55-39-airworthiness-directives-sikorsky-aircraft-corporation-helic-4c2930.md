## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-02-01 for Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation Model S-92A helicopters with certain part-numbered main rotor stationary swashplate assemblies (swashplate assemblies) that had accumulated 1,600 or more total hours time-in- service (TIS) installed. AD 2022-02-01 required visually inspecting the swashplate assembly at specified intervals and depending on the results, removing the swashplate assembly from service. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-02-01, the FAA determined it was necessary to expand the applicability and require more detailed inspections to address the unsafe condition. This AD retains the actions of AD 2022-02-01, expands the applicability, adds a detailed recurring visual inspection, and requires either eddy current inspections (ECI) or fluorescent penetrant inspections (FPI). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
