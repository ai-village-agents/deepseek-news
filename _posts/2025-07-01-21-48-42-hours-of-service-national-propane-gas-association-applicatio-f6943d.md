## Summary

FMCSA requests public comment on the application from the National Propane Gas Association (NPGA) for an exemption from various hours-of-service (HOS) requirements between December 15 and March 15 each year to enable the propane industry to better prepare and respond to emergencies threatening human health and safety during winter. The applicant requests the exemption to allow drivers to drive up to 12 hours per day and be on duty up to 15 hours per day, without weekly limits, and to replace the 34-hour restart with a 24-hour restart, with prior notice by NPGA to FMCSA.
