## Summary

The Department of Energy (DOE) prohibits unauthorized entry and the unauthorized introduction of weapons or dangerous materials into and upon its nuclear sites. The Savannah River Site (SRS), a defense nuclear site comprising approximately 310 square miles of DOE- owned property in Aiken, Allendale and Barnwell Counties, South Carolina, is required to periodically survey and update its boundaries and publish those results in the Federal Register. The purpose of this notice is to provide the public with the most recent amendments to the SRS trespass boundary since its last publication in the Federal Register, and to add descriptions of publicly accessible land parcels and rights-of-way on DOE-owned property at the SRS.
