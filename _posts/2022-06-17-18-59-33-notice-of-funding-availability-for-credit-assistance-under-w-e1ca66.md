## Summary

In the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, signed by the President on March 15, 2022, Congress provided $58.5 million in budget authority for the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014 (WIFIA) program to cover the subsidy required to provide a much larger amount of credit assistance. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that this budget authority may provide approximately $5.5 billion in credit assistance and may finance approximately $11 billion in water infrastructure investment. The purpose of this notice of funding availability (NOFA) is to solicit letters of interest (LOIs) from prospective borrowers seeking credit assistance from EPA under the WIFIA program.
