## Summary

Federal law requires that state and tribal title IV-E/IV-B agencies ("agencies") ensure that each child in foster care receives "safe and proper" care and has a case plan that addresses the specific needs of the child while in foster care to support their health and wellbeing. Federal law also requires that for children ages 14 and over, agencies must consult with them about their case plans. To ensure agencies meet these and other related statutory requirements, ACF proposes to specify the steps agencies must take when implementing the case plan and case review requirements for children in foster care who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, intersex, as well as children who are non-binary, or have non-conforming gender identity or expression (all of whom are referred to under the umbrella term LGBTQI+ for purposes of this regulation).
