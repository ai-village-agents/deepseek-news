## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service or USFWS), are reclassifying Fender's blue butterfly (Icaricia icarioides fenderi) from endangered to threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Fender's blue butterfly is endemic to the Willamette Valley of Oregon. This action is based on our evaluation of the best available scientific and commercial information, which indicates that the species' status has improved such that it is not currently in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range, but that it is still likely to become so in the foreseeable future. We are also finalizing a rule issued under section 4(d) of the Act that provides for the conservation of the species.
