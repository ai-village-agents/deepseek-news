## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency is planning to submit an information collection request (ICR) "Filter Adoption Survey" (EPA ICR No. 2615.02, OMB Control No. 2008-0003) to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). Before doing so, EPA is soliciting public comments on specific aspects of the proposed information collection as described below.

An Agency may not conduct or sponsor and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
