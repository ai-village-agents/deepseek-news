## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), have received an incidental take permit (ITP) application from the Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF), associated with the Western Oregon State Forests habitat conservation plan (HCP), pursuant to the Endangered Species Act. If granted, the ITP would authorize incidental take resulting from activities and conservation activities carried out as part of the HCP conservation strategy. We invite review of and comment on the ITP application and the HCP from local, State, and Federal agencies; Tribes; and the public. A draft environmental impact statement, provided by the National Marine Fisheries Service (lead agency under the National Environmental Policy Act), is also available for review.
