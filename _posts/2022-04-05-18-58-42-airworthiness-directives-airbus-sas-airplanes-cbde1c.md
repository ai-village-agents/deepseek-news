## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that certain overheat detection system (OHDS) sensing elements may not properly detect thermal bleed leak events due to a quality escape during the manufacturing process. This AD requires revising the operator's existing FAA-approved minimum equipment list (MEL) to include dispatch restrictions as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also prohibits the installation of affected parts. This AD also allows operators to inspect affected parts for discrepancies, and do applicable replacements, in order to terminate the revision of the operator's existing MEL required by this AD. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
