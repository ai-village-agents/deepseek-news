## Summary

This notice announces that the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) natural resource Trustees for the Texas Trustee Implementation Group (Texas TIG) have prepared and are making available to the public the Final Restoration Plan/Environmental Assessment #3: Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats (RP/EA #3) and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI). The Final RP/EA #3 considers alternatives to help restore wetlands, coastal, and nearshore habitats injured by the DWH oil spill. The Final RP/EA #3 evaluates a reasonable range of project alternatives under the Oil Pollution Act (OPA) and the OPA Natural Resource Damage Assessment regulations, and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and selects six projects for funding and implementation. A no action alternative is also evaluated pursuant to NEPA.
