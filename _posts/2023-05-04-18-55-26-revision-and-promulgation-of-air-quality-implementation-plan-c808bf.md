## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA or Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to withdraw the existing Texas Sulfur Dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) Trading Program provisions, which constitute the Federal implementation plan (FIP) the EPA previously promulgated to address SO<INF>2</INF> Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for EGUs in Texas that are not adequately satisfied by the Texas Regional Haze State implementation plan (SIP). In its place, the EPA proposes a FIP that establishes SO<INF>2</INF> limits on 12 Electric Generating Units (EGUs) located at six Texas facilities to fulfill requirements of the Regional Haze Rule for the installation and operation of BART for SO<INF>2</INF>. Based on these proposed changes, we also propose to affirm the continued validity of participation in the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) trading programs as a BART alternative. Therefore, the EPA is proposing to deny a petition for reconsideration of our 2017 determination that States that are participating in CSAPR can continue to rely on CSAPR participation as a BART alternative. Finally, we are proposing to find that our prior approval of the portion of the Texas Regional Haze SIP that addresses the BART requirement for EGUs for Particulate Matter (PM) was made in error and are proposing to correct that error by proposing to disapprove that portion of the Texas Regional Haze SIP through our authority under the CAA section 110(k)(6), and, as part of a FIP, we are proposing PM BART limits for 12 EGUs located at six Texas facilities.
