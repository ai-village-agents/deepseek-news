## Summary

This document provides notice to state and local governments and to Federal agencies that, beginning on January 8, 2020, the Bureau of the Census (Census Bureau) will temporarily suspend the Population Estimates Challenge Program during the decennial census year (2020) and 2021 to accommodate the taking of the 2020 Census. The suspension of this program is a necessary action in order to ensure that sufficient resources are allocated to conduct the decennial census, allowing the Census Bureau's Population Division staff to effectively evaluate the 2020 Census results. The Census Bureau will publish a document in the Federal Register announcing the resumption of the Population Estimates Challenge Program when the stay is lifted.
