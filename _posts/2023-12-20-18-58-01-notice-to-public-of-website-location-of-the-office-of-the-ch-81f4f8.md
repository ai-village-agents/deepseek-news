## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency) is announcing the website location where the Agency will post a list of possible topics for future guidance document development or revision by the Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS) during the next year. In addition, FDA has established a docket where interested persons may provide comments that could benefit the OCS guidance program and its engagement with stakeholders, including comments on the priority of topics for guidance. This feedback is critical to the OCS guidance program as we consider feedback from stakeholders along with Agency resources and priorities.
