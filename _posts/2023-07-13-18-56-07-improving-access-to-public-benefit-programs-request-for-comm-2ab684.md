## Summary

The Department of Housing and Urban Development is seeking comments from the public regarding the burden faced when applying for or maintaining eligibility for HUD's housing programs. HUD recognizes that these administrative hurdles and paperwork burdens disproportionately fall on the most vulnerable populations and prevent individuals and entities from accessing benefits for which they are legally eligible. Public comment submitted in response to this request for comment will assist HUD in better understanding, identifying, and reducing HUD's public program administrative burden and ultimately further its mission to pursue transformative housing and community- building policies and programs.
