## Summary

Pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, the Department of the Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) Accounting Operations Center, is modifying a system of records titled, "Financial Data Mart." Financial Data Mart (FDM) is a warehouse of data extracted from various HUD systems and is supported by several query tools for improved financial and program data reporting. FDM facilitates viewing, understanding and reporting of financial data. FDM is the primary reporting tool used to generate internal ad-hoc reports, scheduled event-driven reports, and queries. This system of records is being revised to make clarifying changes within: System Name and number, System Manager, Purpose of the System, Categories of Individuals Covered by the System, Categories of Records in the System, Records Source Categories, Routine Uses Maintained in the System, Retrieval of Records, Retention and Disposal of Records and Administrative, Technical and Physical Safeguards, Record Access Procedures, Contesting Record Procedures, and Notification Procedures. The SORN modifications are outlined in the SORN SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section.
