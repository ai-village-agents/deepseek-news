## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain General Electric Company (GE) Model CF6-80C2B1F, CF6-80C2B2F, CF6-80C2B4F, CF6-80C2B5F, CF6-80C2B6F, CF6-80C2B7F, and CF6-80C2K1F engines. This AD was prompted by an uncontained engine fire and consequent manufacturer investigation, which revealed that certain bearings were installed improperly. This AD requires inspection of the magnetic chip detector (MCD) probe tip for metallic particles and, if necessary, removal of the engine from service. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
