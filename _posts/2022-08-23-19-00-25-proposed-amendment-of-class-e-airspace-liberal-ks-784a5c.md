## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace at Liberal, KS. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of an airspace review as part of the decommissioning of the Liberal very high frequency (VHF) omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimal Operational Network (MON) Program. The name and geographic coordinates of the airport and the name of the navigational aid would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
