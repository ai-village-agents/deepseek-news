## Summary

NMFS announces the re-opening of the commercial sector for red snapper in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the South Atlantic through this temporary rule. The most recent data for commercial landings of red snapper indicate the commercial annual catch limit (ACL) for the 2023 fishing year has not yet been reached. Therefore, NMFS re-opens the commercial sector to harvest red snapper in the South Atlantic EEZ for 4 days. The purpose of this temporary rule is to allow for the red snapper commercial ACL to be harvested while minimizing the risk of exceeding the commercial ACL.
