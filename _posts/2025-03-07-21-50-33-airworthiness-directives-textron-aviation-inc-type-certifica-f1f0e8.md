## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Textron Aviation, Inc., Model 560 and 560XL airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of mis-wired fire extinguishing bottles. This proposed AD would require an engine fire extinguisher system functional test, an inspection of the fire extinguisher bottle cartridge wire numbers and yellow ID sleeves for proper identification and legibility, and applicable corrective actions. This proposed AD would also require revising the existing inspection program to incorporate new airworthiness limitations for repetitive inspections of the engine fire extinguisher wiring and, as applicable, auxiliary power unit (APU) fire extinguisher wiring. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
