## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-1A11 (600), CL-600-2A12 (601), and CL-600-2B16 (601-3A, 601-3R, and 604 Variants) airplanes. This AD was prompted by an uncommanded flap extension accompanied by a flaps fail caution message during climb. This AD requires initial and repetitive operational tests of the flap control system. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
