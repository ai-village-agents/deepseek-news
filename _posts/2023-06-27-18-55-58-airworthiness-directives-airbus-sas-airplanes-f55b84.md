## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2008-23- 01, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A318, A319, A320, and A321 series airplanes. AD 2008-23-01 required inspecting to determine the part number and serial number of the fuel tank boost pumps and, for airplanes with affected pumps, revising the operator's airplane flight manual (AFM) and FAA-approved maintenance program. AD 2008-23-01 also required modifying or replacing certain fuel tank boost pumps, which terminated the AFM limitations and the maintenance program revisions. Since the FAA issued AD 2008-23-01, it has been determined that airplanes fitted with a different fuel pump can be subject to cavitation erosion on the wiring conduit. This AD requires inspecting affected fuel pumps for discrepancies and replacement if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). This AD also requires replacing certain other fuel pumps. This AD also limits the installation of affected fuel pumps under certain conditions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
