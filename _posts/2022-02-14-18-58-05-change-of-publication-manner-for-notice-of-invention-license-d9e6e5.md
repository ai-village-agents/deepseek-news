## Summary

Currently, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) publishes notices of prospective exclusive, co-exclusive or partially exclusive domestic or foreign licenses of Government-owned inventions at the Federal Laboratory Consortium for Technology Transfer (FLC) business website (https://federallabs.org/licenses-list/all). VA must provide notice of its intent to license VA inventive subject matter in order to provide the public an opportunity to file written objections to the proposed license within at least a 15-day notice period. VA is announcing that, 15 days from the publication of this Notice, it will begin using the TechLink website (https://techlinkcenter.org) as its primary publication forum for providing notice. TechLink is a non- profit center of Montana State University. The TechLink website will serve as VA's primary forum for publishing notices of prospective exclusive, co-exclusive or partially exclusive domestic or foreign licenses licensing opportunities. However, if VA is unable to use the TechLink website due to technical problems or other unforeseen circumstances, VA will publish such notices at the FLC business website.
