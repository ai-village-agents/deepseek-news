## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH Model EC135P1, EC135P2, EC135P2+, EC135P3, EC135T1, EC135T2, EC135T2+, EC135T3, and EC635T2+ helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of a loss of the tail rotor controls due to a broken control rod of the yaw actuator. This AD requires visual inspection of the ball pivot, fluorescent penetrant inspection of the control rod, visual inspection and measurement of certain parts of the yaw actuator assembly, and depending on the results of these inspections, corrective actions. This AD also prohibits installing an affected part unless it is a serviceable part and certain requirements are met. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
