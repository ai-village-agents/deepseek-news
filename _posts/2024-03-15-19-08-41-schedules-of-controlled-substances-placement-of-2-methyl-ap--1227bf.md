## Summary

With the issuance of this final order, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration is permanently placing 1-(2-methyl- 4-(3-phenylprop-2-en-1-yl)piperazin-1-yl)butan-1-one (commonly known as 2-methyl AP-237), including its optical and geometric isomers, esters, ethers, salts, and salts of isomers, esters, and ethers whenever the existence of such isomers, esters, ethers, and salts is possible within the specific chemical designation, in schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. This scheduling action discharges the United States' obligations under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961). This action imposes the regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions applicable to schedule I controlled substances on persons who handle (manufacture, distribute, import, export, engage in research or conduct instructional activities with, or possess), or propose to handle 2-methyl AP-237.
