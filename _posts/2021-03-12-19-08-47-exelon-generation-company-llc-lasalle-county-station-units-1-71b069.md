## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering issuance of amendments to Renewed Facility Operating License Nos. NPF- 11 and NPF-18 issued to Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Exelon, the licensee) for operation of LaSalle County Station, Units 1 and 2 (LaSalle), located in Brookfield Township, LaSalle County, Illinois. The proposed action would revise the technical specifications (TS) for the plant to allow for an average, rather than absolute, ultimate heat sink (UHS) sediment level and would modify the UHS temperature curve to increase the allowable TS diurnal temperature limits of the cooling water supplied to the plant from the UHS. The NRC is issuing an environmental assessment (EA) and finding of no significant impact (FONSI) associated with the proposed license amendments.
