## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Airbus Helicopters Model SA-365N, SA-365N1, AS-365N2, AS 365 N3, EC 155B, and EC155B1 helicopters. This AD was prompted by reports of the cockpit doors failing to open after ditching with inflated floats on certain helicopters equipped with an emergency flotation system (EFS). This AD requires revising the existing Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) for your helicopter, installing placards, and depending on your model helicopter, modification of the jettisoning system, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference (IBR). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
