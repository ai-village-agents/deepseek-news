## Summary

The FAA is correcting an airworthiness directive (AD) that published in the Federal Register. That AD applies to all Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation (Gulfstream) Model GV and GV-SP airplanes. As published, a revision level and a table number in certain document citations in the Credit for Previous Actions section of the regulatory text are incorrect. This document corrects those errors. In all other respects, the original document remains the same.
