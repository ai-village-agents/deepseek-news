## Summary

EPA is announcing the availability of the 2020 mercury inventory report, which summarizes information on U.S. mercury supply, use, and trade required to be reported by rule directly from mercury manufacturers, importers, and processors. EPA was directed by Congress in the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (Lautenberg Act), which amended the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), to carry out and publish in the Federal Register not later than April 1, 2017 and every three years thereafter, an inventory of mercury supply, use, and trade in the United States. The Lautenberg Act defines "mercury" as "elemental mercury" or "a mercury compound."
