## Summary

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is continuing to modernize and streamline its patent application systems to support robust and reliable patent rights, speed the issuance of patents, and reduce the costs and barriers of global patent protection. The submission of patent applications in DOCX format facilitates the USPTO's ongoing efforts. The USPTO recognizes that, during the transition, some applicants have been hesitant to file patent applications in DOCX format. On April 28, 2022, the USPTO announced that, for a temporary period, ending on December 31, 2022, it was providing patent applicants with the option to submit an applicant- generated PDF version of the application along with the DOCX file(s) when filing an application in Patent Center. Based on stakeholder requests, the USPTO is extending the temporary period during which patent applicants have the option to submit an applicant-generated PDF of the application along with the validated DOCX file(s) when filing an application in Patent Center through June 30, 2023. To encourage greater adoption of DOCX so that the USPTO can move forward with its other modernization and harmonization efforts, there is no change to the January 1, 2023, effective date of the non-DOCX filing surcharge fee.
