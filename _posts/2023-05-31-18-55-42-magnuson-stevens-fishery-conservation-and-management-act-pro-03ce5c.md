## Summary

This action proposes to approve and implement Framework Adjustment 65 to the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan. This rule proposes to revise the rebuilding plan for Gulf of Maine cod, set catch limits for 16 of the 20 multispecies (groundfish) stocks, and make a temporary modification to the accountability measures for Georges Bank cod. This action also corrects erroneous regulations and removes outdated regulations. This action is necessary to respond to updated scientific information and to achieve the goals and objectives of the fishery management plan. The proposed measures are intended to help prevent overfishing, rebuild overfished stocks, achieve optimum yield, and ensure that management measures are based on the best scientific information available.
