## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-23- 04, which applied to certain Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation Model GVII-G500 and GVII-G600 airplanes. AD 2020-23-04 required revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) and airplane maintenance manual (AMM) to include information pertaining to the fuel boost pump. This AD was prompted by a report of misassembled impellers on the shaft of the fuel boost pump during production. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2020-23-04 and requires inspecting affected fuel boost pumps for proper installation of the impeller shaft key, marking affected fuel boost pumps that pass that inspection, and replacing fuel boost pumps that fail. This AD also limits the installation of affected fuel boost pumps. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
