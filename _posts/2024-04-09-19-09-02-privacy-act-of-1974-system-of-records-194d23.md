## Summary

Pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, the National Labor Relations Board ("NLRB" or "Agency") publishes this notice of a modified system of records entitled Next Generation Case Management System (NxGen) (NLRB-33), which includes records from twelve systems of records that are no longer being maintained, and so those twelve systems of records notices are being rescinded. NxGen, an electronic case tracking system, permits the accurate and timely collection, retrieval, and retention of information maintained by offices of the Agency regarding those offices' handling of matters before them, including unfair labor practice and representation cases. This notice also includes the rescindment of two other systems of records that the Agency has stopped maintaining: Investigative Services Case Files (NLRB-16, Federal Register, May 16, 1988), and Telephone Call Detail Records (NLRB-19, Federal Register, August 17, 1994). All persons are advised that, in the absence of submitted comments considered by the Agency as warranting modification of the notice as proposed, it is the intention of the Agency that the notice shall be effective upon expiration of the comment period without further action.
