## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of Escherichia coli strain K-12 P678-54 micelles (also known as E. coli K-12 derived micelles) when used as an inert ingredient (encapsulation of active ingredient) on growing crops and raw agricultural commodities pre- and post-harvest. AgroSpheres, Inc., submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of E. coli K-12 derived micelles, when used in accordance with the terms of those exemptions.
