## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Bell Textron Canada Limited (type certificate previously held by Bell Helicopter Textron Canada Limited) (Bell) Model 429 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by the identification of certain parts needing life limits and certification maintenance requirement (CMR) tasks. This proposed AD would require establishing life limits and CMR tasks for various parts. Depending on the results of the CMR tasks, this proposed AD would require corrective action. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
