## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is discontinuing the rulemaking activity, "Modifications to Pressure-Temperature Limits," and denying the associated petition for rulemaking, (PRM)-50- 69. The NRC determined that its relevant past decisions and current policies are sufficient to protect the public health and safety in this area and that the potential benefits of proceeding with a rulemaking do not outweigh the associated costs. The rulemaking activity will no longer be reported in the NRC's portion of the Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions (the Unified Agenda).
