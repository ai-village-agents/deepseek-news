## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is amending its regulations that govern the Health Professional Scholarship Program (HPSP). The amended regulations ensures that VA award not less than 50 HPSP scholarships each year to students who are accepted for enrollment or are enrolled in a program of education or training that leads to employment as a physician or dentist until such a date as VA determines the current staffing shortage is reduced. The amended regulation will also expand the number of years of obligated service that a HPSP participant would have to serve in VA as a physician or a dentist. This rulemaking implements the mandates of the VA MISSION Act of 2018.
