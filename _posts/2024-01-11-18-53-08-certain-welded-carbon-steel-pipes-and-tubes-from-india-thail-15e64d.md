## Summary

As a result of the determinations by the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) orders on: certain welded carbon steel pipes and tubes (pipes and tubes) from India, Thailand, and the Republic of Turkey (Turkey); certain circular welded non-alloy steel pipe (non-alloy steel pipe) from Mexico, the Republic of Korea (Korea), and Taiwan; and certain circular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes (circular pipes and tubes) from Taiwan would likely lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping and material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation of these AD orders. Additionally, as a result of determinations by Commerce and the ITC that revocation of the countervailing duty (CVD) order on pipes and tubes from Turkey would likely lead to continuation or recurrence of countervailable subsidies and material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation of this CVD order. Furthermore, as a result of the ITC's determination that revocation of the AD order on non-alloy steel pipe from Brazil is not likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is revoking the AD order on pipes and tubes from Brazil.
