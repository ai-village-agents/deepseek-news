## Summary

The Rural Business Development Grant (RBDG) program is intended for governmental entities and non-profits that foster economic development, job creation and business creation in rural and Tribal communities. Eligible applicants for RBDG assistance include rural towns, communities, State agencies, authorities, nonprofit corporations, institutions of higher education, Federally recognized Tribes (https://www.bia.gov/service/tribal-leaders-directory) and cooperatives (if organized as a private nonprofit corporation). United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) intends to improve Tribal Government participation in the program. This final rule seeks to increase Tribal Government participation with programmatic amendments. This final rule responds to all comments received on the proposed rule.
