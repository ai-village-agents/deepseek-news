## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are announcing the availability of documents associated with an application to amend an enhancement of survival permit (permit) under the Endangered Species Act. The Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks has applied to amend the existing Programmatic Safe Harbor Agreement and Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances for 15 Aquatic Species in Kansas (SHA/CCAA) by adding 6 additional covered species: Lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), sicklefin chub (Macrhybopsis meeki), sturgeon chub (Macrhybopsis gelida), snuffbox mussel (Epioblasma triquetra), spectaclecase (Cumberlandia monodonta), and Ouachita kidneyshell (Ptychobranchus occidentalis). The documents available for review and comment are the applicant's proposed amended programmatic SHA/CCAA, which is part of the permit amendment application, and our draft environmental action statement and low-effect screening form, which support a categorical exclusion for the amendment under the National Environmental Policy Act. We invite comments from the public and Federal, Tribal, State, and local governments.
