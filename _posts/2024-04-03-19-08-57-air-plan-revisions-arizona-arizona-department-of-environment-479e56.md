## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing two revisions to the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) portion of the Arizona State Implementation Plan (SIP). In this action, we are finalizing the approval of revisions submitted by the ADEQ governing the issuance of permits for stationary sources in accordance with changes that EPA has made to its New Source Review (NSR) program regulations under the Clean Air Act (CAA or "the Act"). We are also finalizing the determination that with these revisions, the ADEQ's NSR program satisfies the requirements for the preconstruction review and permitting of major sources and major modifications under part D of title I of the Act for areas designated nonattainment with the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) with a Marginal classification, for areas and sources within the ADEQ's permitting jurisdiction.
