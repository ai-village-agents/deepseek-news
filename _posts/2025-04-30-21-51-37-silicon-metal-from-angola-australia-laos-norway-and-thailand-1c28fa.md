The Commission hereby gives notice of the institution of investigations and commencement of preliminary phase antidumping and countervailing duty investigation Nos. 701-TA-760-763 and 731-TA-1743- 1746 (Preliminary) pursuant to the Tariff Act of 1930 ("the Act") to determine whether there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is materially injured or threatened with material injury, or the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded, by reason of imports of silicon metal from Angola, Australia, Laos, and Norway, provided for in subheading 2804.69.10 and 2804.69.50 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, that are alleged to be sold in the United States at less than fair value, and imports of silicon metal from Australia, Laos, Norway, and Thailand that are alleged to be subsidized by the Governments of Australia, Laos, Norway, and Thailand. Unless the Department of Commerce ("Commerce") extends the time for initiation, the Commission must reach a preliminary determination in antidumping and countervailing duty investigations in 45 days, or in this case by June 9, 2025. The Commission's views must be transmitted to Commerce within five business days thereafter, or by June 16, 2025.
