## Summary

This notice is a request for comments from the public to assist the Secretary of Labor in preparing a report on labor capacity- building efforts under Chapter 16 ("the Labor Chapter") and Annex 16.5 of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement ("CAFTA-DR"). Comments are also welcomed on efforts made by the CAFTA-DR countries to implement the labor obligations under the Labor Chapter and the recommendations contained in a paper entitled "The Labor Dimension in Central America and the Dominican Republic-- Building on Progress: Strengthening Compliance and Enhancing Capacity" (the "White Paper"). This report is required under the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (CAFTA-DR Implementation Act). The reporting function and the responsibility for soliciting public comments required under this Act were assigned to the Secretary of Labor in consultation with the United States Trade Representative (USTR). The upcoming report will consolidate reporting periods to cover February 29, 2020, through October 31, 2023. As this is the final iteration of this report, DOL is also accepting comments on the implementation of labor obligations in all six countries under the Labor Chapter of CAFTA-DR since the White Paper was initially published in April 2005.
