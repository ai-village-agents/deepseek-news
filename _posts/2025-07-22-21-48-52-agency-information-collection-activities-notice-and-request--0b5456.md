## Summary

The Department of Transportation (DOT) invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval on the reinstatement of a previously approved collection on Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 108. Before a Federal agency can collect certain information from the public, it must receive approval from the OMB. Under procedures established by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, before seeking OMB approval, Federal agencies must solicit public comment on proposed collections of information, including extensions and renewals of previously approved collections. This document describes a collection of labeling information on FMVSS No. 108, for which NHTSA intends to seek OMB approval. The labeling requirement is for retroreflective sheeting material.
