## Summary

This rule is to rescind the regulation published on January 5, 2021, titled "Procedures for the review and clearance of USAID's Guidance Documents." This action is necessary to comply with the Executive order (E.O.) titled "Revocation of Certain Executive Orders Concerning Federal Regulation," signed on January 20, 2021, which specifically requires the revocation of the E.O. titled "Promoting the Rule of Law Through Improved Agency Guidance Documents," signed on October 9, 2010. To comply with the new E.O., USAID is removing its regulations setting forth processes and procedures for USAID to issue guidance documents as defined in October 2010 E.O.
