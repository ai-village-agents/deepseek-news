## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the Ohio State Implementation Plan (SIP). Ohio removed its Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) rules that apply to a secondary lead smelter, which has permanently shut down. EPA is proposing approval of revisions that will remove those OAC rules from the Ohio SIP. The revisions will also remove air quality sampling requirements that are duplicative of another OAC provision in the Ohio SIP.
