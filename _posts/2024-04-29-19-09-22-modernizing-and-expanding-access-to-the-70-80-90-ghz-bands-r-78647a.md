## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) continues to play a leading role in fostering innovation in the provisioning of broadband, including through novel technological solutions as well as fifth-generation wireless technology (5G). Meeting the non-stop growth in demand for wireless broadband connectivity is more important than ever due to the outsized impact the internet has on its work, education, health care, and personal connections. Recognizing this reality, and to help close the digital divide, the Report and Order adopts new rules and updates preexisting ones. The Commission also updates its rules to permit the use of smaller and lower-cost antennas to facilitate the provision of backhaul service and mandates a channelization plan . Finally, the Commission adopts changes to the link registration process in certain bands requiring certification of construction of registered links to promote more efficient use of this spectrum and improve the accuracy of the link registration database.
