## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing partial approval and partial disapproval of revisions to the Missouri State Implementation Plan (SIP) received on March 20, 2019 and June 10, 2021. The SIP revisions in the 2019 and 2021 submittals incorporate updates to construction permit requirement regulations for stationary and portable air sources in Missouri that help ensure ambient air quality standards are met. The changes include numerous organizational changes, administrative and typographical edits to improve clarity of the construction permit process. The revisions include added procedures for the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MoDNR) to issue general permits. For portable equipment installations, the potential to emit major source threshold of particulate matter was changed to match federal requirements. The changes proposed for approval meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act. EPA is proposing to disapprove section (1)(B) regarding voluntary permits. EPA is proposing disapproval because the language of the provision is too vague and does not provide sufficient clarity for implementation.
