## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is partially approving and partially disapproving a Clean Air Act (CAA) section 111(d) plan submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to implement the EPA's Emission Guidelines and Compliance Times for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills (Emission Guidelines). This State plan submittal pertains to the regulation of landfill gas and its components from existing municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills. We are partially approving the State plan because it meets many of the requirements of the Emission Guidelines. However, we are partially disapproving the State plan because it does not fully meet certain provisions of the Emission Guidelines.
