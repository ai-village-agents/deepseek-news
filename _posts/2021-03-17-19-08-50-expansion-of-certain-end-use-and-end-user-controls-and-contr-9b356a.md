## Summary

The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), Department of Commerce, is correcting an interim final rule, "Expansion of Certain End-Use and End-User Controls and Controls on Specific Activities of U.S. Persons," that appeared in the Federal Register of January 15, 2021 (hereinafter referred to as the January 15 rule) by revising an incorrect instruction that would have resulted in the inadvertent deletion of two subparagraphs of the Export Administration Regulations' (EAR) restrictions on certain rocket systems and unmanned aerial vehicles.
