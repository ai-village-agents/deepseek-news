## Summary

Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as implemented by the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations, the DoN has prepared and filed with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) that evaluates the potential environmental effects associated with constructing and operating a graving dry dock (DD) and waterfront production facility (WPF) at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility (PHNSY & IMF) at Joint Base Pearl Harbor[hyphen]Hickam (JBPHH), Oahu, Hawaii. A graving dry dock is a narrow basin constructed near the shoreline that can be flooded to allow watercraft to be floated in, then drained to allow the watercraft to come to rest on a dry platform. Dry docks are used for the maintenance and repair of ships, boats, submarines, and other watercraft. A WPF is a facility situated at the waterfront that is used to support maintenance of these vessels.
