## Summary

This NPRM proposes to amend the Materials of Trade (MOTs) exceptions to allow for the transportation of increased quantities of lithium batteries. The current MOT exceptions unnecessarily limit the number and size of lithium batteries that can be safely transported by domestic construction, landscaping, mowing, tree service, food service, and entertainment companies in support of performing a trade.
