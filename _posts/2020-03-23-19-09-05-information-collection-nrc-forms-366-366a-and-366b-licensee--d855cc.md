## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is correcting a notice that was published in the Federal Register (FR) on February 26, 2020, providing notice of submission to the Office of Management and Budget and requesting comment. This action is necessary to amend the annual responses and burden hours to include the burden and responses associated cyber security events. The NRC has decided to extend the public comment period to allow more time for members of the public to develop and submit their comments. The public comment period was originally scheduled to close on March 27, 2020.
