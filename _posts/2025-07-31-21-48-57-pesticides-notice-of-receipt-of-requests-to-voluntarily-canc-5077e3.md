## Summary

This document announces the Agency's receipt of and solicits comment on requests by registrants to voluntarily cancel their pesticide registrations. In accordance with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), EPA provides a periodic notice of receipt addressing requests received by EPA since the last notice of receipt was issued and uses the month and year in the title to help distinguish one document from the other. For this notice, EPA has compiled the requests received between April 1, 2025, and June 30, 2025. EPA intends to grant these requests at the close of the comment period for this announcement unless the Agency receives substantive comments during the comment period that would merit further review of the requests, or the request is withdrawn by the registrant. If these requests are granted, EPA will issue an order in the Federal Register cancelling the listed product registrations, after which any sale, distribution, or use of the products listed in this document will only be permitted after the registrations have been cancelled if such sale, distribution, or use is consistent with the terms as described in the final order.
