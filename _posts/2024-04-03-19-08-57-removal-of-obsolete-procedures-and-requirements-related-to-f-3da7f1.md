## Summary

On December 12, 2022, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued an interim final rule, which amended regulations to update information that was no longer accurate since the creation of the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), the Web-based system DHS uses to collect and maintain current and ongoing information on Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)-certified schools, F-1 and M-1 nonimmigrant students, and J-1 Exchange Visitor Program participants and their sponsors. DHS is now issuing this final rule that introduces no substantive changes from the interim final rule.
