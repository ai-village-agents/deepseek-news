## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) Board is issuing this interim final rule to make a correction to the numbering of one system of records and to exempt one system of records from certain requirements of the Act. NCUA has previously published System of Records Notices (SORN) for these systems. The Board has found good cause to issue the interim final rule without advance notice-and-comment procedures and with an immediate effective date.
