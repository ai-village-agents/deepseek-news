## Summary

This document announces the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) receipt of a petition for a decision that model year (MY) 1994 to 1997 Jaguar Daimler Double Six passenger cars (PCs) that were not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSS), are eligible for importation into the United States because they are substantially similar to vehicles that were originally manufactured for sale in the United States and that were certified by their manufacturer as complying with the safety standards (the U.S.-certified version of the 1994 to 1997 Jaguar Daimler Double Six PCs) and are capable of being readily altered to conform to the standards.
