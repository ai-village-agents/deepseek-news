## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain General Electric Company (GE) GEnx-1B64, -1B64/P1, -1B64/P2, - 1B67, -1B67/P1, -1B67/P2, -1B70, -1B70/75/P1, -1B70/75/P2, -1B70/P1, - 1B70/P2, -1B70C/P1, -1B70C/P2, -1B74/75/P1, -1B74/75/P2, -1B76/P2, - 1B76A/P2, GEnx-2B67, -2B67B, and -2B67/P model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by an in-flight shutdown (IFSD) of an engine and subsequent investigation by the manufacturer that revealed an improperly torqued fuel metering unit (FMU) bypass valve (BPV) plug. This AD requires a shim check inspection of the FMU BPV plug and, depending on the results of the inspection, replacement of the FMU. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
