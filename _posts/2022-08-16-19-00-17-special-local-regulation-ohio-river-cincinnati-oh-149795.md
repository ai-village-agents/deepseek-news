## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary special local regulation for all navigable waters of the Ohio River, extending the entire width of the river, between mile marker (MM) 464.0-473.0 and the Licking River between MM 0.0-0.3. In the event the Ohio River Gauge is at or above the 45 foot level, the special local regulation will extend west to MM 476.0. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters near Cincinnati, OH during Riverfest 2022 on September 4, 2022 through September 5, 2022. This rulemaking prohibits persons and vessels from operating above no wake speeds in the area unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Sector Ohio Valley or a designated representative.
