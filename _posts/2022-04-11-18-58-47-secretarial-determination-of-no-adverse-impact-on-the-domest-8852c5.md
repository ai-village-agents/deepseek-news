## Summary

On November 24, 2021, the Secretary of Energy issued a determination ("Secretarial Determination") covering the sale, lease, or transfer of up to 750 kilograms uranium (kgU) of high-assay low enriched uranium (HALEU) (above 5 but less than 20 wt. percent uranium- 235) per calendar year to support the development and establishment of molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) production capabilities. For the reasons set forth in the Department's "Analysis of Potential Impacts of Certain Uranium Transactions on the Domestic Uranium Mining, Conversion, and Enrichment Industries," which is incorporated into the Secretarial Determination, the Secretary determined that these transactions will not have an adverse material impact on the domestic uranium mining, conversion, or enrichment industry.
