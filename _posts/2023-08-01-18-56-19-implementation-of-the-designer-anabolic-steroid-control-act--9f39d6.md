## Summary

On December 18, 2014, the Designer Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2014 (DASCA) became law. The Act amended the Controlled Substances Act to revise and add specified substances to the definition of "anabolic steroid." The Act provided a new mechanism for temporary and permanent scheduling of anabolic steroids, and added specific labeling requirements for products containing anabolic steroids. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is publishing this rule to amend and reorganize its regulations to make them consistent with DASCA regarding the updated definition, specific substances, criteria and timeframes applicable to temporary and permanent scheduling of anabolic steroids, and labeling requirements.
