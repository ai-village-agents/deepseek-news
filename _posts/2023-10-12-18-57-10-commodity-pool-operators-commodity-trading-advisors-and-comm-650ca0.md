## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission or CFTC) is proposing amendments to certain provisions of its regulations that would: update the Portfolio Requirement thresholds within the "Qualified Eligible Person" definition; require commodity pool operators (CPOs) and commodity trading advisors (CTAs) operating pools and trading programs under the applicable Commission regulations to provide certain minimum disclosures to their prospective pool participants and advisory clients; include revisions that are consistent with long-standing Commission exemptive letters addressing the timing of certain pools' periodic financial reporting; and several technical amendments related to the structure of the regulations that are the subject of this proposal.
