## Summary

NOAA's National Ocean Service (NOS) National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS), hereafter NOAA, in partnership with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), is working to build spatial planning capacity in the Southeast United States Region (Southeast U.S.). Through this notice, NOAA is seeking public input to identify coastal and marine spatial data or other critical information to inform marine spatial analyses in Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. The input we receive from the data development workshop meeting, as well as the responses to the items listed in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section of this document, will be used to inform potential coastal and ocean development activities in the Southeast U.S., such as renewable energy development.
