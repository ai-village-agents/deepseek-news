## Summary

Notice is given that the Principal Deputy Director of the Indian Health Service (IHS), under the authority of the Public Health Service Act, and the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, has approved the following rates for inpatient and outpatient medical care provided by IHS facilities for Calendar Year 2020 for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, beneficiaries of other federal programs, and for recoveries under the Federal Medical Care Recovery Act. The inpatient rates for Medicare Part A are excluded from the table below, as Medicare inpatient payments for IHS hospital facilities are made based on the prospective payment system or reasonable costs when IHS facilities are designated as Medicare Critical Access Hospitals. Since the inpatient per diem rates set forth below do not include all physician services and practitioner services, additional payment shall be available to the extent that those services are provided.
