## Summary

EPA is issuing a final rule to add Trichoderma reesei (T. reesei) strain QM6a and its derivatives and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (B. amyloliquefaciens) subspecies (subsp.) amyloliquefaciens to the list of recipient microorganisms that may be used to qualify for the Tier I and Tier II exemptions from full notification and reporting procedures under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for new microorganisms that are being manufactured for introduction into commerce. EPA received petitions to add T. reesei and B. amyloliquefaciens to the list of microorganisms eligible for the exemption from full notification and reporting procedures under the TSCA for new microorganisms. Based on EPA's evaluation of these petitions, EPA has made the determination that certain strains of both microorganisms will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment when used as a recipient microorganism provided that certain criteria for the introduced genetic material and the physical containment conditions are met.
