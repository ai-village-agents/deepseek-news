## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), the GSA is proposing a revision to an existing information collection request (ICR) for the Data Collection Form (SF-SAC) and associated FAC webform. The revisions add an optional resubmission pathway and optional structured fields within audit findings (questioned costs, criteria, condition, cause, effect, recommendation, response), as well as new Yes/No webform fields for auditor disclosures of known fraud, likely fraud, summary schedule of prior audit findings, and significant instances of abuse, consistent with 2 CFR 200.516(b)(5)-(7).
