## Summary

The Coast Guard is announcing its intent to enter into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with General Dynamics Mission Systems (GDMS) to evaluate the suitability of implementing open-source-based SDR technologies on shore-side and shipboard environments. The effort would include evaluating the utility of a P25 Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA)-compliant interface for software defined radios (SDRs). This CRADA would leverage Coast Guard network infrastructure and shipboard IT communications systems to evaluate open-source SDR technologies and determine how they can be implemented to support multiple Coast Guard core mission areas for shore-side and shipboard use under a variety of scenarios. Technology researched, tested, and prototyped will adhere to all active Coast Guard, Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) standards and regulations. While the Coast Guard is currently considering partnering with GDMS, we are soliciting public comment on the possible nature of and participation of other parties in the proposed CRADA. In addition, the Coast Guard invites other potential participants, who have interest and capability, to consider submitting proposals for consideration in similar CRADAs.
