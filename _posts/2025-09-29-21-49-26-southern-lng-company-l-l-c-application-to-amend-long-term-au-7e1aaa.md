## Summary

The Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM) (formerly the Office of Fossil Energy (FE)) of the Department of Energy (DOE) gives notice (Notice) of receipt of an application (Amendment Application), filed by Southern LNG Company, L.L.C. (Southern LNG) on July 31, 2025, and supplemented on September 11, 2025. Southern LNG seeks to amend its existing long-term authorization to export domestically produced liquefied natural gas (LNG) to non-free trade agreement countries set forth in DOE/FE Order No. 3956 (as amended)-- specifically to allow such exports (1) in approved containers loaded onto vessels and (2) in bulk, loaded into bunkering vessels for ship- to-ship transfer as marine fuel to ships located within the territorial seas of foreign countries (including that country's ports). No other part of the existing authorization would be affected. Southern LNG also seeks to amend an application it filed in a separate proceeding, to allow additional exports to non-FTA countries, to include the same amendments to the activities it seeks for its existing authorization. Southern LNG filed the Amendment Application under the Natural Gas Act (NGA).
