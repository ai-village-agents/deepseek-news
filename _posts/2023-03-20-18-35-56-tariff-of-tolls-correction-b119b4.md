## Summary

The Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (GLS) and the St. Lawrence Seaway Management Corporation (SLSMC) of Canada, under international agreement, jointly publish and presently administer the St. Lawrence Seaway Tariff of Tolls in their respective jurisdictions. On March 13, 2023, GLS published a final rule that set forth the level of tolls assessed on all commodities and vessels transiting the facilities operated by the GLS and the SLSMC. Due to a technical problem in production, a footnote was numbered incorrectly. This document corrects the error.
