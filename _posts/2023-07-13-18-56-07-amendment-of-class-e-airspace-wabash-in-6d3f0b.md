This action amends the Class E airspace at Wabash, IN. This action is the result of an airspace review caused by the decommissioning of the Kokomo very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimum Operating Network (MON) Program. The geographic coordinates of the airport are also being updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
