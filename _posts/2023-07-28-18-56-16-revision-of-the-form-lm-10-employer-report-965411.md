## Summary

The Office of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS) of the Department of Labor (Department) is revising the Form LM-10 Employer Report upon review of the comments received in response to its September 13, 2022 notice of proposed form revision. Under section 203 of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (LMRDA or the Act), employers must file a Form LM-10 Employer Report with the Department to disclose certain payments, expenditures, agreements, and arrangements. Under the revision, the Department adds a checkbox to the Form LM-10 report requiring certain reporting entities to indicate whether such entities were Federal contractors or subcontractors in their prior fiscal year, and two lines for entry of filers' Unique Entity Identifier and Federal contracting agency or agencies, if applicable.
