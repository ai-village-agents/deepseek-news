## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily determines that certain stainless steel sheet and strip (SSSS) of Chinese-origin that has undergone further processing in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (Vietnam) is merchandise covered by the scope of the antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on SSSS from the People's Republic of China (China). Additionally, Commerce preliminarily determines that SSSS that is completed in Vietnam using certain non-subject stainless steel flat-rolled inputs sourced from China, is circumventing the AD/CVD orders on SSSS from China. As a result, SSSS of Chinese-origin that has undergone further processing or completion in Vietnam will be subject to suspension of liquidation effective May 15, 2020. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary determinations.
