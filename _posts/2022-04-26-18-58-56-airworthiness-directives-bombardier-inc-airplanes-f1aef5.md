## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-1A10 and BD-700-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports that some oxygen box assemblies had their piston ejected during the mask deployment test. This proposed AD would require a one-time inspection of each passenger oxygen box dual manifold assembly to find and replace affected parts. This proposed AD would also prohibit installing affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
