## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) published a notice of opportunity to request administrative reviews of orders, findings, or suspended investigations with anniversary dates in April 2024 in the Federal Register of April 1, 2024. Commerce inadvertently omitted the countervailing duty order on Common Alloy Aluminum Sheet from Bahrain, and the period of review for that order of 1/1/2023-12/31/2023, from that notice. We are including the missing information in this correction notice.
