## Summary

EIA invites public comment on the proposed three-year extension, without changes, to the Coal Markets Reporting System (CMRS), as required under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The CMRS consists of five surveys including, Form EIA-3 Quarterly Survey of Non- Electric Sector Coal Data, Form EIA-7A Annual Survey of Coal Production and Preparation, Form EIA-8A Annual Survey of Coal Stocks and Coal Exports, Form EIA-6 Emergency Coal Supply Survey (Standby), and Form EIA-20 Emergency Weekly Coal Monitoring Survey for Coal Burning Power Producers (Standby.) The CMRS collects data on U.S. coal production, quality, consumption, receipts, stocks, and prices. EIA requests the extension to Forms EIA-3, EIA-6, EIA-7A, EIA-8A, and EIA-20 without change.
