## Summary

NMFS is establishing a Take Reduction Team (TRT or Team) to address the incidental mortality and serious injury (M/SI) of humpback whales that would, at a minimum, consider Federal sablefish pot fishery interactions with the Central America/Southern Mexico-CA/OR/WA and Mainland Mexico-CA/OR/WA stocks of humpback whales, and may also be expanded to consider other fisheries in the Pacific Ocean. The TRT will develop a Take Reduction Plan (TRP or Plan) as required under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). NMFS requests public comments on information relevant to establishing the TRT as well as interest from stakeholders who wish to be considered for TRT membership.
