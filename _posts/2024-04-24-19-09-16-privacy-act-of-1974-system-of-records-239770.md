## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the DoD is modifying and reissuing a current system of records titled, "MyPay System," T7336. This system of records was originally established by the DFAS to collect and maintain records on individual payroll accounts. This system of records notice (SORN) is being updated to expand the `Categories of Individuals Covered' section to cover non- appropriate personnel, and to add the standard DoD routine uses (routine uses A through J). The DoD is also modifying various other sections within the SORN to improve clarity or update information that has changed.
