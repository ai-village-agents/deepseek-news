## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary regulated navigation area and a safety zone on the Hampton River at the inlet to Hampton Harbor, Hampton, NH, in response to hazardous conditions created by construction activities for the Neil R. Underwood Seabrook- Hampton Harbor Bridge replacement project. The RNA will establish a speed restriction and a traffic pattern. The safety zone, when enforced, will prohibit all vessel traffic from transiting through or operating within 50 yards of the bridge(s) center span navigational channel. This rule is necessary to provide for the safety of life in the areas undergoing demolition and construction.
