## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH Model MBB-BK 117 C-2, MBB-BK 117 D- 2, and MBB-BK 117 D-3 helicopters. This AD was prompted by reports of damaged hoist hooks and hoist hook nuts. This AD requires performing an inspection of the affected hoist hook and affected hook nut and, depending on the results of the inspection, replacing the affected hoist hook and affected hook nut. This AD also prohibits installing an affected assembly (hoist hook attached to the hook damper) on any helicopter, and prohibits installing an affected hoist hook on any helicopter unless it is installed using updated procedures. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
