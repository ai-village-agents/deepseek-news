## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves extracting flight data such as aircraft, routing speed, etc. from domestic and international flights. FAA Form 7233-1, Flight Plan: Domestic flight plan information is used to govern the flight of aircraft for the protection and identification of aircraft and property and persons on the ground. The information is used by air traffic controllers, search and rescue (SAR) personnel, flight standards inspectors, accident investigators, military, law enforcement, and the Department of Homeland Security. FAA Form 7233-4, International Flight Plan: International flight plan information is used for the same purposes as domestic flight plans; in addition, it is used by Customs and international controllers.
