## Summary

Hawaii has applied to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for updated approval of changes made to its Underground Storage Tank Program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, since the previous approval of Hawaii's Underground Storage Tank Program in September 2002. The EPA has reviewed Hawaii's application and has determined that these changes satisfy all requirements needed to qualify for the requested updated approval. The EPA is correcting one citation identified as a result of public comment received on the proposal to approve Hawaii's Underground Storage Tank Program that was published in August 2020. All other aspects of the August 2020 proposed State Program Approval remain the same. Therefore, the EPA is granting final approval to the State of Hawaii to operate its Underground Storage Tank Program for petroleum and hazardous substances.
