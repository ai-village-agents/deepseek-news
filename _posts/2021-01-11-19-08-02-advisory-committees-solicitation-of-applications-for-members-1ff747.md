## Summary

Pursuant to the authorities given to the Director of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) under the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) Director Kraninger invites the public to apply for membership for appointment to its Consumer Advisory Board (CAB), Community Bank Advisory Council (CBAC), Credit Union Advisory Council (CUAC), and Academic Research Council (ARC), (collectively, advisory committees). Membership of the advisory committees includes representatives of consumers, diverse communities, the financial services industry, academics, and economists. Appointments to the committees are generally for two years. However, the Director may amend the respective committee charters from time to time during the charter terms, as the Director deems necessary to accomplish the purpose of the committees. The Bureau expects to announce the selection of new members in late-summer 2021.
