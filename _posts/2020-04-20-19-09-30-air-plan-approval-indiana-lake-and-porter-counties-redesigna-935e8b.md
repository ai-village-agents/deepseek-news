## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to find that the Chicago-Naperville, IL-IN-WI area (Chicago Area) is attaining the 2008 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS or standard) and to approve a request from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM or Indiana) to redesignate the Indiana portion of the Chicago area to attainment for the 2008 ozone NAAQS because the request meets the statutory requirements for redesignation under the Clean Air Act (CAA). The Indiana portion of the Chicago 2008 ozone area consists of Lake and Porter Counties in Northwest Indiana. Indiana submitted this request on February 27, 2020. EPA is also proposing to approve, as a revision to the Indiana State Implementation Plan (SIP), the State's plan for maintaining the 2008 ozone NAAQS through 2030 in the Chicago area. EPA is also proposing to approve a waiver, for the Indiana portion of the Chicago area (Lake and Porter Counties), from the oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) requirements of section 182(f) of the CAA. Finally, EPA finds adequate and is proposing to approve Indiana's 2025 and 2030 volatile organic compound (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) Motor Vehicle Emission Budgets (MVEBs) for the Indiana portion of the Chicago area (Lake and Porter Counties).
