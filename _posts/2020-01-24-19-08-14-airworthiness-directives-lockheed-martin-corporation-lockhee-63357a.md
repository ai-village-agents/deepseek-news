## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Lockheed Martin Corporation/Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company Model 382, 382B, 382E, 382F, and 382G airplanes, type certificated in any category; and Model C-130A, C-130B, C-130BL, C-130E, C-130H, C-130H-30, C-130J, C-130J-30, EC-130Q, HC-130H, KC-130H, NC-130B, NC-130, and WC- 130H airplanes, type certificated in the restricted or amateur category. This AD was prompted by a report indicating that two elevator booster assemblies experienced significant hydraulic fluid leaks, caused by fatigue cracks in the actuator cylinder. This AD requires an inspection to determine the part number of the elevator booster actuator, repetitive ultrasonic inspections of the actuator to detect cracking, and replacement of cracked elevator booster assemblies. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
