## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing guidance on petitions for a No Migration Variance (NMV) under the Land Disposal Restrictions (LDRs) pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for persons applying for a NMV for a waste pile temporarily located within a RCRA-permitted Subtitle C landfill cell. EPA solicited public comments on a draft of this guidance on January 19, 2021 (86 FR 5190). The public comment period ended February 18, 2021. EPA received nine (9) comments on the draft guidance. EPA appreciates the comments. The Agency carefully considered all of the points raised and has concluded that the comments do not provide reason for EPA to modify the guidance as it was proposed. Accordingly, EPA is finalizing the guidance without alteration. The guidance and the Agency's response to these comments are located in the Docket (EPA-HQ-OLEM-2020-0689).
