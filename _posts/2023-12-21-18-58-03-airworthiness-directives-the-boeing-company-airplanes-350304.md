## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-08-12, which applies to all The Boeing Company Model 757 airplanes. AD 2022-08-12 requires repetitive inspections for skin cracking and shim migration at the upper link drag fittings, diagonal brace cracking, and fastener looseness; and applicable on-condition actions. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-08-12, it was determined that certain drag fittings may be made of alternate materials, which could result in reduced structural integrity of the engine strut, and that additional inspections and revised compliance times are needed. This proposed AD would retain the requirements of AD 2022-08-12 with revised compliance times for certain actions and would add inspections for existing repairs and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
