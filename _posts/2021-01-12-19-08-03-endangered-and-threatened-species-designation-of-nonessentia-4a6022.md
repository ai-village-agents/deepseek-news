## Summary

We, NMFS, announce the extension of the public comment period on our December 11, 2020, 30-day proposal of a rule to designate and authorize the release of a nonessential experimental population (NEP) of Central Valley (CV) spring-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in the upper Yuba River and its tributaries upstream of Englebright Dam, California, and establish take exceptions for the NEP for particular activities. A draft environmental assessment (EA) has been prepared on this proposed action and is available for comment. As part of that proposed action, we solicited comment on the proposed rule and EA over a 30-day period to end on January 11, 2021. Today, we update contact information, website addresses and extend the public comment period by 60 days to March 12, 2021. Comments previously submitted need not be resubmitted, as they will be fully considered in the agency's proposed action.
