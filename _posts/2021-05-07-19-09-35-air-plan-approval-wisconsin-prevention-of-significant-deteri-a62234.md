## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a revision to the Wisconsin state implementation plan (SIP), submitted by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) on September 30, 2008. The revision updates the definition of "Replacement Unit" and clarifies a component of the emission calculation used to determine emissions under a plantwide applicability limitation (PAL) in the Wisconsin Administrative Code. Approving this revision makes Wisconsin rules consistent with Federal rules. EPA proposed to approve this action on November 9, 2020 and received no adverse comments.
