## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is amending approved State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of Connecticut to address SIP revisions submitted to meet moderate area nonattainment requirements for the 2008 ozone standard. The SIP revisions are for the Greater Connecticut and the Connecticut portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT moderate ozone nonattainment areas, and include these areas 2011 base year emissions inventories, an emissions statement certification, reasonable further progress (RFP) demonstrations, reasonably available control measures (RACM) analyses, motor vehicle emissions budgets, and contingency measures. This rule does not change any final action taken by EPA in an earlier final rule published on October 1, 2018; this action merely corrects the Clean Air Act (CAA) citation for moderate area contingency measures.
