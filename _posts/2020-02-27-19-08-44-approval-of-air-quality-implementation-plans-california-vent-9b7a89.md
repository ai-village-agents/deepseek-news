## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve portions of two state implementation plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of California to meet Clean Air Act (CAA or "the Act") requirements for the 2008 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or "standards") in the Ventura County, California ("Ventura County") ozone nonattainment area. The two SIP revisions include the "Final 2016 Ventura County Air Quality Management Plan," and the Ventura County portion of the "2018 Updates to the California State Implementation Plan." In this action, the EPA refers to these submittals collectively as the "2016 Ventura County Ozone SIP." The 2016 Ventura County Ozone SIP addresses the nonattainment area requirements for the 2008 ozone NAAQS, including the requirements for an emissions inventory, attainment demonstration, reasonable further progress, reasonably available control measures, contingency measures, among others; and establishes motor vehicle emissions budgets. The EPA is taking final action to approve the 2016 Ventura County Ozone SIP as meeting all the applicable ozone nonattainment area requirements except for the contingency measure requirement, for which the EPA will be taking final action in a separate document.
