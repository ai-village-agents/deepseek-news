## Summary

This final rule changes the reporting requirements for certain Irish potatoes, tomatoes, and onions regulated under section 608e of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (section 8e). With this change, importers of those regulated commodities that have been certified by a designated governmental inspection service other than the Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service as meeting section 8e requirements will be required to provide the inspection certificate number and a copy of the certificate to the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) (currently, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency is the only entity so designated). In addition, this rule changes the pistachio import regulations to provide for the electronic filing of aflatoxin test results and to eliminate a requirement to report the disposition of reworked or failed lots of pistachios. This rule also changes several of the section 8e regulations by removing or replacing outdated information.
