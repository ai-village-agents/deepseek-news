## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Airbus Helicopters Model SA-365C1 and SA-365C2 helicopters. This AD was prompted by a Model EC225 helicopter accident and subsequent investigation that determined that the level of particles in certain main gearboxes (MGB) could lead to a planet gear seizure. This AD requires inspecting the MGB magnetic plugs and oil filter for particles and, depending on the outcome of the inspections, further inspections and replacing certain parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
