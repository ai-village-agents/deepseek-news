## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), announces the opening of a docket to obtain comment on the proposed Laboratory Recommendations for Syphilis Testing in the United States. The proposed recommendations for syphilis testing include laboratory-based tests, point-of-care tests, processing of samples, and reporting of test results. The recommendations are intended to aid laboratorians and clinicians in the diagnosis of syphilis. These proposed recommendations are intended for use by clinical laboratory directors, laboratory staff, clinicians, and disease control personnel who must choose among the multiple available testing methods, establish standard operating procedures for collecting and processing specimens, interpret test results for laboratory reporting, and counsel and treat patients in the United States.
