## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Helicopters Model EC120B helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of broken and bent attachment bolts of the main rotor (MR) hub scissors assembly. This AD requires an inspection of the attachment bolts of the MR hub scissors assembly for discrepancies and repair if necessary; part marking of the attachment bolts of the MR hub scissors assembly; and repetitive inspections of the part marking of the attachment bolts, and repair if necessary; as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
