## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing Revision 5 of Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.82, "Water Sources for Long-Term Cooling Following a Loss-of-Coolant Accident." This revised guidance updates the guidance for sumps and suppression pools that provide water sources for emergency core cooling, containment heat removal, or containment atmosphere cleanup systems. It also provides guidelines for evaluating the adequacy and the availability of the sump or suppression pool for long-term recirculation cooling following a loss-of-coolant accident, and the use of containment accident pressure in determining the net positive suction head for the emergency core cooling and containment heat removal pumps.
