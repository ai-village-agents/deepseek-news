## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A318-112, A319-111, A319-112, A319-113, A319- 114, A319-115, A319-131, A319-132, A319-133, A320-211, A320-212, A320- 214, A320-216, A320-231, A320-232, A320-233, A320-251N, and A320-271N airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of marginal clearance between certain fuel sensor covers on both left-hand (LH) and right- hand (RH) wings. This AD requires the replacement of certain fuel level sensor brackets, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
