## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving changes to the Jefferson County portion of the Kentucky State Implementation Plan (SIP), submitted by the Commonwealth of Kentucky, through the Energy and Environment Cabinet (Cabinet), via a letter dated June 15, 2022. The changes were submitted by the Cabinet on behalf of the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District (District) and amend the District's stationary source emissions monitoring and reporting requirements. EPA is approving the changes because they are consistent with the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act).
