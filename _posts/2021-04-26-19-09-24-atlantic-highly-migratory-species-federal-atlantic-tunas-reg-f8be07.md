## Summary

NMFS proposes adding Maine to the list of states for which NMFS has determined that Federal Atlantic tunas regulations are applicable within state waters. NMFS is proposing the addition after considering a request from the Maine Department of Marine Resources (MEDMR) and reviewing the state's relevant laws and regulations. Most states and territories bordering the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico are currently included in the list, with the exception of Maine, Connecticut, and Mississippi. This proposed addition of Maine to the list would make Federal Atlantic tunas regulations--including but not limited to open and closed seasons, retention limits, size limits, authorized gears and gear restrictions, and permitting and reporting requirements--applicable in Maine state waters. This action would be consistent with section 9(d) of the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (ATCA) and implementing regulations.
