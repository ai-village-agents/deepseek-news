## Summary

The Department of Commerce (Commerce) has completed its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on fresh garlic from the People's Republic of China (China) for the period of review (POR) November 1, 2019, through October 31, 2020. We determine that mandatory respondent, Jining Shunchang Import & Export Co., Ltd. (Shunchang) failed to establish its eligibility for a separate rate and, therefore, is part of the China-wide entity. We are rescinding the review with respect to Zhengzhou Harmoni Spice Co., Ltd. (Harmoni).
