## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report indicating that foreign object debris (FOD) could have been introduced during rework of certain engine fire shutoff switches (EFSS). This proposed AD would require determining the serial number of the left and right EFSS and replacing affected parts. This proposed AD would also limit the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
