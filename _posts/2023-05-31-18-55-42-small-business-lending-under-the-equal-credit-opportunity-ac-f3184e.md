## Summary

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB or Bureau) is amending Regulation B to implement changes to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) made by section 1071 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). Consistent with section 1071, covered financial institutions are required to collect and report to the CFPB data on applications for credit for small businesses, including those that are owned by women or minorities. The final rule also addresses the CFPB's approach to privacy interests and the publication of data; shielding certain demographic data from underwriters and other persons; recordkeeping requirements; enforcement provisions; and the rule's effective and compliance dates.
