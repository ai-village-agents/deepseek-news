## Summary

Under section 4(d) of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) shall issue protective regulations the Secretary deems necessary and advisable for the conservation of species listed as threatened. The Secretary may apply any of the prohibitions in section 9 of the ESA. This proposed rule would promulgate protective regulations to apply a subset of the ESA section 9 prohibitions to the Banggai cardinalfish (Pterapogon kauderni). We also announce the availability of a draft environmental assessment (EA) that analyzes the environmental impacts of this action, and solicit comments regarding this action and the draft EA.
