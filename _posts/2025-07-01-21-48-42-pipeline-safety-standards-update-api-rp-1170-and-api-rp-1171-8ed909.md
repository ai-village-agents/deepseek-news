## Summary

This DFR amends PHMSA's regulations to incorporate by reference the updated industry standards API RP 1170, Design and Operation of Solution-mined Salt Caverns Used for Natural Gas Storage, and API RP 1171, Functional Integrity of Natural Gas Storage in Depleted Hydrocarbon Reservoirs and Aquifer Reservoirs. These updated standards will maintain or improve public safety, prevent regulatory confusion, reduce compliance burdens on stakeholders, and satisfy a mandate in the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA) of 1995.
