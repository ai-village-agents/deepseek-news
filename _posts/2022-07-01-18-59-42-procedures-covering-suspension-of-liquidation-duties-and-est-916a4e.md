## Summary

On June 6, 2022, the President signed Presidential Proclamation 10414 (Proclamation). The Proclamation declares an emergency to exist and states that immediate action is needed to ensure access to a sufficient supply of solar cells and modules to assist in meeting the United States' electricity generation needs. Accordingly, the Proclamation authorizes the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to exercise authority under section 318(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), to extend during the course of such emergency the time to perform any act. The Proclamation also authorizes the Secretary to allow the importation of certain solar cells and modules from certain Southeast Asian countries free of the collection of duties and estimated duties under the antidumping and countervailing duty laws until 24 months after the date of the Proclamation, or until the emergency is declared terminated, whichever occurs first. In accordance with the Proclamation and the authority granted to the Department of Commerce (Commerce), Commerce is issuing a proposed rule to postpone and waive the application of certain regulations, if otherwise applicable, to solar cells and modules, exported from the identified Southeast Asian countries, that are subject to certain circumvention inquiries currently before Commerce. This proposed rule would provide that, in the event of an affirmative preliminary or final determination in the circumvention inquiries, Commerce would not instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to suspend liquidation of entries of these cells and modules, collect cash deposits on those entries, or apply antidumping or countervailing duties to those entries, so long as the entries of the cells or modules were entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption before June 6, 2024 or before the date the emergency has terminated, whichever occurs first (in either case, the Date of Termination).
