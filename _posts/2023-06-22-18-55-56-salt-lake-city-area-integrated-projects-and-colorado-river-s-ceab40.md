## Summary

The Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP) Management Center (MC) of the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) proposes a new Salt Lake City Area Integrated Projects (SLCA/IP) firm power rate and updated effective dates for existing CRSP transmission, joint dispatch transmission, ancillary services, and sale of surplus products formula rates. The current firm power rate expires December 31, 2023. The CRSP transmission services, ancillary services, and surplus products rates that expire September 30, 2025, and the CRSP joint dispatch transmission service rate that expires September 30, 2024, are included in Rate Order No. WAPA-206 to make all the rate schedules effective for the same timeframe. The firm power service rate is proposed to remain the same. No material changes are proposed to the other rate schedules aside from updating the effective dates.
