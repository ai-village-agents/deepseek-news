## Summary

The Department of Labor (DOL), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, conducts a pre- clearance request for comment to provide the public and Federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on proposed collections of information in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This request helps to ensure that: requested data can be provided in the desired format; reporting burden (time and financial resources) is minimized; collection instruments are clearly understood; and the impact of collection requirements on respondents can be properly assessed. Currently, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Policy (OASP) is soliciting comments on an information collection of user registrations to access a public Application Programming Interface providing machine readable subsets of public data generated by DOL programs and activities.
