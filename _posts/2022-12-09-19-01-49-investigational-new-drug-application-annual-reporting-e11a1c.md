## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is proposing to replace its current annual reporting requirement for investigational new drug applications (INDs) with a new requirement: the annual FDA development safety update report (FDA DSUR). The proposed annual FDA DSUR is intended to be consistent with the format and content of the DSUR that is supported by the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), which is described in FDA's ICH guidance for industry entitled "E2F Development Safety Update Report" (E2F DSUR) (August 2011). The proposed annual FDA DSUR regulation, if finalized, would require an annual report that is more comprehensive and informative than the IND annual report currently required under FDA regulations.
