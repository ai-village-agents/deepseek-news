## Summary

This action implements the New England Fishery Management Council's Industry-Funded Monitoring Omnibus Amendment. This amendment allows the New England Council flexibility to increase monitoring in certain fishery management plans to assess the amount and type of catch and reduce uncertainty around catch estimates. This amendment establishes a process to standardize future industry-funded monitoring programs in New England fishery management plans and establishes industry-funded monitoring in the Atlantic herring fishery. This action helps ensure consistency in industry-funded monitoring programs across fisheries and increases monitoring in the Atlantic herring fishery.
