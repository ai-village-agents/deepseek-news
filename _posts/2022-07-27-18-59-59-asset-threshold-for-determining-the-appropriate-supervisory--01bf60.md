## Summary

The NCUA Board (Board) is amending its regulations to revise the $10 billion asset threshold used for assigning supervision of consumer federally insured credit unions (FICUs) to the Office of National Examinations and Supervision (ONES). The rule only applies to FICUs whose assets are $10 billion or more (covered credit unions). The rule provides that covered credit unions with less than $15 billion in total assets (tier I credit unions) will be supervised by the appropriate NCUA Regional Office. Covered credit unions with $15 billion or more in total assets (tier II and tier III credit unions) continue to be supervised by ONES. The rule does not alter any regulatory requirements for covered credit unions.
