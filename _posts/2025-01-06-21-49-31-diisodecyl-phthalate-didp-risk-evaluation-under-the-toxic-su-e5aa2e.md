## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is announcing the availability of the final risk evaluation under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP). The purpose of risk evaluations under TSCA is to determine whether a chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, without consideration of costs or non-risk factors, including unreasonable risk to potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations identified as relevant to the risk evaluation by EPA, under the conditions of use. EPA used the best available science to prepare this final risk evaluation and determined, based on the weight of scientific evidence, that DIDP poses unreasonable risk to human health. Under TSCA, EPA must initiate risk management actions to address the unreasonable risk.
