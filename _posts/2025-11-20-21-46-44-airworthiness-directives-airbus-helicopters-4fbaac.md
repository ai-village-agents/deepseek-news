## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model H160-B helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that several self-locking nuts of the window jettisoning system could be loosened by hand due to a non-conformity in the cable kit. This proposed AD would require modifying an affected window into a serviceable window. This proposed AD would also prohibit installing an affected window or an affected door on any helicopter. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
