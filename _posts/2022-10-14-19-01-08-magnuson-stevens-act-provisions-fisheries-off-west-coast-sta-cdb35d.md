## Summary

This proposed rule would establish the 2023-24 harvest specifications for groundfish caught in the U.S. exclusive economic zone seaward of Washington, Oregon, and California, consistent with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act and the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan. This proposed rule would also revise management measures intended to keep the total annual catch of each groundfish stock or stock complex within the annual catch limits. These proposed measures are intended to help prevent overfishing, rebuild overfished stocks, achieve optimum yield, and ensure management measures are based on the best scientific information available. This proposed rule would also make minor corrections to the regulations. Additionally, this proposed rule announces the receipt of exempted fishing permit applications. NMFS has made a preliminary determination that these applications warrant further consideration. NMFS requests public comment on these applications. This action also would implement portions of Amendment 30 to the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan, which would specify a shortbelly rockfish catch threshold to initiate Council review; extend the length of the limited entry fixed gear sablefish primary season; change the use of Rockfish Conservation Area boundaries; expand the use of Block Area Closures to control catch of groundfish; and correct the definition of Block Area Closures. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, NMFS also announces the availability of a draft environmental assessment that analyzes the potential effects of the associated proposed rule.
