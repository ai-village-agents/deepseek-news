## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-03- 25, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and - 233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2019-03-25 required repetitive inspections of the center and outer wing box lower stiffeners and panels at a certain junction on the left- and right-hand sides for any cracking, and repair if necessary. AD 2019-03-25 also provided an optional modification, which would terminate the repetitive inspections. This AD was prompted by a determination that, for certain airplanes, the compliance time for the initial inspection is inadequate and must be revised. This AD continues to require the actions specified in AD 2019-03-25 with revised compliance times for certain airplanes and additional actions for certain airplanes, and expands the applicability, as specified in a European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
