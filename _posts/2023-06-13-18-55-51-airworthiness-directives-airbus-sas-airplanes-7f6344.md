## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-19- 05, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A330-841 and -941 airplanes. AD 2022-19-05 required maintenance actions, including a high pressure valve (HPV) seal integrity test, repetitive replacement of the HPV clips, revision of the existing airplane flight manual (AFM), and implementation of updates to the FAA-approved operator's minimum equipment list (MEL). This AD was prompted by additional instructions and maintenance procedures developed to address failures of the HPV. This AD continues to require certain actions in AD 2022-19-05 and provides additional criteria for the installation of HPV and HPV clips, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
