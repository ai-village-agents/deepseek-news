## Summary

The FAA is revising a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that would have applied to certain Schempp-Hirth Flugzeugbau GmbH (Schempp-Hirth) Model CIRRUS gliders. This action revises the NPRM by changing references to the affected glider model from CIRRUS to STANDARD CIRRUS throughout the proposed airworthiness directive (AD). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products. The FAA is requesting comments on this SNPRM.
