## Summary

The FDIC is inviting comment on a proposed rule that would modify the requirements for FDIC-supervised institutions to file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs). The proposed rule would amend the FDIC's SAR regulation to allow the FDIC to issue exemptions from the SAR requirements. The proposed rule would make it possible for the FDIC to grant relief to FDIC-supervised institutions that develop innovative solutions to meet Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requirements more efficiently and effectively.
