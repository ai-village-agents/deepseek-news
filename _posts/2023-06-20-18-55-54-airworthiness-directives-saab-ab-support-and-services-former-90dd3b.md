## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Saab AB, Support and Services Model 340A (SAAB/SF340A) and SAAB 340B airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of a high number of events related to stall warnings upon landing, following introduction of the ice speed function within the stall warning system. This proposed AD would require modification of the stall warning/ identification system, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
