## Summary

This is the second part of a two-part final rule that simplifies the eligibility and enrollment processes for Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the Basic Health Program (BHP). This rule aligns enrollment and renewal requirements for most individuals in Medicaid; establishes beneficiary protections related to returned mail; creates timeliness requirements for redeterminations of eligibility; makes transitions between programs easier; eliminates access barriers for children enrolled in CHIP by prohibiting premium lock-out periods, benefit limitations, and waiting periods; and modernizes recordkeeping requirements to ensure proper documentation of eligibility determinations.
