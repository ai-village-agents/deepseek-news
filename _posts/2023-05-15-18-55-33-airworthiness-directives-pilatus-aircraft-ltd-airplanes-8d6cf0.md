## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Pilatus Aircraft Ltd. (Pilatus) Model PC-24 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of an electrical burning smell in the cabin without the presence of smoke. This proposed AD would require revising the Limitations Section of the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) for your airplane, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
