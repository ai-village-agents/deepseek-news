## Summary

NMFS has received a request from Hilcorp Alaska, LLC (Hilcorp) for promulgation of incidental take regulations (ITR) and issuance of an associated Letter of Authorization (LOA) that would authorize continued take of marine mammals over 5 years (2026-2031) incidental to the construction, maintenance and use of sea ice roads, trails and adjacent ice pads after the expiration of the existing ITR and LOA. Pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), NMFS is proposing regulations setting forth permissible methods of taking, other means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact on such marine mammal stocks (i.e., mitigation measures), and requirements pertaining to monitoring and reporting takes and requests comments on the proposed rule. NMFS will consider public comments prior to making any final decision on the promulgation of the requested ITR and issuance of the LOA; agency responses to public comments will be summarized in the final rule, if promulgated.
