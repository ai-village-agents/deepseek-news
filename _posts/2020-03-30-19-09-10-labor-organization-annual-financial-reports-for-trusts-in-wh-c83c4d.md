# Labor Organization Annual Financial Reports for Trusts in Which a Labor Organization Is Interested, Form T-1; Correction

**Published:** February 05, 2026 19:09 UTC

## Summary

The Department of Labor, Office of Labor-Management Standards is correcting a final rule that appeared in the Federal Register of March 6, 2020. That document revised the forms required by labor organizations under the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act ("LMRDA" or "Act"). Under the rule, specified labor organizations file annual reports (Form T-1 Trust Annual Report) concerning trusts in which they are interested. The Form T-1 Instructions published with the final rule, however, provided inaccurate examples concerning the applicability dates of the final rule. This document corrects those omissions.
