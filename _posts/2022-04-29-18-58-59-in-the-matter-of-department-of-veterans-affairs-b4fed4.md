## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing a Confirmatory Order to the Department of Veterans Affairs to memorialize the agreement reached during an alternative dispute resolution mediation session held on March 2, 2022. The order will resolve all issues related to apparent violations that occurred when a nuclear medicine technologist willfully failed to conduct a measurement of the concentration of strontium-82 and strontium-85 prior to use of a strontium-82/rubidium-82 generator and willfully falsified records relating to the same failure to conduct the required measurement. The Confirmatory Order includes a number of significant commitments undertaken by the Department of Veterans Affairs to enhance the safety culture among its employees involved in nuclear medicine. The Confirmatory Order is effective upon issuance.
