## Summary

This final rule will advance CMS's efforts to improve access to care, quality and health outcomes, and better address health equity issues for Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) managed care enrollees. The final rule addresses standards for timely access to care and States' monitoring and enforcement efforts, reduces State burdens for implementing some State directed payments (SDPs) and certain quality reporting requirements, adds new standards that will apply when States use in lieu of services and settings (ILOSs) to promote effective utilization and that specify the scope and nature of ILOSs, specifies medical loss ratio (MLR) requirements, and establishes a quality rating system for Medicaid and CHIP managed care plans.
