## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing rulemaking action on two state implementation plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of Delaware. Whenever EPA promulgates a new or revised National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), states are required to make a SIP submission showing how the existing approved SIP has all the provisions necessary to meet the requirements of the new or revised NAAQS, or to add any needed provisions necessary to meet the revised NAAQS. The SIP revision is required to address basic program elements, including, but not limited to, regulatory structure, monitoring, modeling, legal authority, and adequate resources necessary to assure attainment and maintenance of the standards. These elements are referred to as infrastructure requirements. Delaware has made a submittal addressing the infrastructure requirements for the 2015 ozone NAAQS and EPA is proposing to approve Delaware's SIP revision addressing the infrastructure requirements for the 2015 ozone NAAQS in accordance with the requirements of Clean Air Act (CAA) section 110(a). EPA is also approving a second submittal from Delaware which updates a reference to the current version of EPA's modeling guidance.
