## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of improper grinding of the inner diameter of the main landing gear (MLG) outer cylinders, resulting in possible heat damage to the outer cylinders. This AD requires a records check or inspection to determine if an affected outer cylinder is installed and replacing all affected outer cylinders. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
