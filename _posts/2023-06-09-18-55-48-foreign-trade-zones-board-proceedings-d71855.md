## Summary

The Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) proposes to amend its regulations and invites public comment on these proposed revisions. These modifications, if adopted, would allow for additional electronic fee payment options and make other minor clarifications and corrections to the regulatory language. Sections of the Board's 2012 regulations regarding application formats contained information collection requirements and could not be effective until the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved the information collection requests, which occurred on March 25, 2013.
