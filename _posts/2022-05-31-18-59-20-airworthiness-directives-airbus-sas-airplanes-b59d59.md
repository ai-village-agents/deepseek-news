## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A300 series airplanes, Model A300 B4-600, B4- 600R, and F4-600R series airplanes, and Model A300 C4-605R Variant F airplanes (collectively called Model A300-600 series airplanes). This AD was prompted by reports of cracking in the main landing gear (MLG) support rib 5 lower flange. This AD requires a one-time detailed inspection (DET) of the affected area, and applicable corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
