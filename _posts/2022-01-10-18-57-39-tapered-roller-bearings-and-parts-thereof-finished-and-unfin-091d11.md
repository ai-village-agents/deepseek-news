## Summary

The Department of Commerce (Commerce) determines that Shanghai Tainai Bearing Co., Ltd. (Tainai) sold tapered roller bearings and parts thereof, finished and unfinished, (TRBs) from the People's Republic of China (China) at less than normal value (NV) during the period of review (POR), June 1, 2019, through May 31, 2020. Additionally, Commerce determines that it is appropriate to rescind this administrative review of the antidumping duty (AD) order on TRBs from China with respect to BRTEC Wheel Hub Bearing Co., Ltd. (BRTEC) and Zhejiang Jingli Bearing Technology Co. Ltd. (Jingli) because they had no bona fide sales to the United States during the POR. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
