## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (VCAPCD) portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern definitions applicable to local rules that control emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from processing, production, gathering, and separation of crude oil and natural gas, and the transfer and storage of reactive organic compound liquids and petroleum material. We are proposing to approve a local rule to regulate these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or "the Act"). We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
