## Summary

NMFS closes the Angling category northern area fishery for large medium and giant Atlantic bluefin tuna (BFT) (i.e., "trophy" fish measuring 73 inches (185 cm) curved fork length or greater). This action is being taken to prevent further overharvest of the Angling category northern area trophy BFT subquota.
