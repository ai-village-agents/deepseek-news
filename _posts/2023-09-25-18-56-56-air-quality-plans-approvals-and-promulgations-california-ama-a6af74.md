## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a permitting rule submitted as a revision to the Amador Air District (AAD or "District") portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). This revision concerns the District's New Source Review (NSR) permitting program for new and modified sources of air pollution under part D of Title I of the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act"). This action will update the District's applicable SIP with a rule revised to address deficiencies identified in a previous limited disapproval action. This action also proposes to revise regulatory text to clarify that the District is not subject to the Federal Implementation Plan related to protection of visibility. We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
