## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace at Borger, TX; Pampa, TX; and Spearman, TX. The FAA is proposing these actions due to airspace reviews conducted as part of the decommissioning of the Borger very high frequency (VHF) omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimal Operational Network (MON) Program. The names and geographic coordinates of some airports would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
