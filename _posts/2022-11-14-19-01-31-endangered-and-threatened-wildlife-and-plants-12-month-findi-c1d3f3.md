## Summary

We, NMFS, have completed a comprehensive status review under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) for the shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus) in response to a petition from Defenders of Wildlife to list the species. After reviewing the best scientific and commercial data available, including the Status Review Report, we have determined that listing the shortfin mako shark as a threatened or endangered species under the ESA is not warranted.
