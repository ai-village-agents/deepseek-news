## Summary

On September 15, 2023 the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA or Agency) published a notice of proposed rulemaking ("NPRM" or "proposed rule") to amend regulations governing SBA's business loan programs (7(a) Loan Program, 504 Loan Program, Microloan Program, Intermediary Lending Pilot Program (ILP), Surety Bond Guarantee Program, and the Disaster Loan Program (except for the COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) Program) for criminal background reviews. The proposed rule introduced amendments to improve equitable access based on criminal background review of applicants seeking to participate in one or more of these programs. This final rule implements proposed regulatory changes and addresses comments SBA received.
