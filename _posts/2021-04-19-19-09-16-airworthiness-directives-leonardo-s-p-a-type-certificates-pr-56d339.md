# Airworthiness Directives; Leonardo S.p.a. (Type Certificates Previously Held by Agusta S.p.A. and AgustaWestland S.p.A.) Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Leonardo S.p.a. (Type Certificate previously held by Agusta S.p.A.) Model AB139 and AW139 helicopters and Leonardo S.p.a. (Type Certificate previously held by AgustaWestland S.p.A.) Model AW189 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of missing lock wire and loose fasteners. This proposed AD would require a one-time inspection of the main rotor (M/R) slip ring and depending on the outcome, removing the M/R slip ring from service, removing screws and washers from service, applying torque, installing lock wire, and re-identifying the M/R slip ring. This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of certain M/R slip rings. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
