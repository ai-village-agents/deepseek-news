## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of the Army proposes to establish a new system of records titled, Army Safety Management Program Records (ASMPR)-A0385-1 DAS. It supports the management and prevention of work-related illnesses and injuries by individuals engaged in DoD work-related activities while on or off the worksite. The system automates accidents, mishaps, safety inspections, and workplace hazard investigation data collection, identifies causal factors and potentially unsafe practices or conditions, and makes recommendations for corrective actions to prevent recurrence and reduce hazardous conditions. Additionally, DoD is issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which proposes to exempt this system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act, elsewhere in today's issue of the Federal Register.
