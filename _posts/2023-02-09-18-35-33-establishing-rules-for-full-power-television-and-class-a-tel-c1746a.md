## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission or FCC) seeks comment on comprehensively deleting, updating, or otherwise revising Commission rules for full power television and Class A television stations that no longer have any practical effect given the completion of the transition from analog to digital-only operations and the post incentive auction transition to a smaller television band with fewer channels. This NPRM also seeks comment on a restructuring of the Commission's full power television rules, which largely consist of the technical licensing, operating, and interference rules for full power television.
