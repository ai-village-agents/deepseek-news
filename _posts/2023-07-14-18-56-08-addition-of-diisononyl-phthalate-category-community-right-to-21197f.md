## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is adding a diisononyl phthalate (DINP) category to the list of toxic chemicals subject to the reporting requirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) and the Pollution Prevention Act (PPA). In this action, EPA is adding the DINP category to the toxic chemical list as a category defined to include branched alkyl di-esters of 1,2 benzenedicarboxylic acid in which alkyl ester moieties contain a total of nine carbons. The DINP category meets the EPCRA chronic human health effects toxicity criterion because the members of the category can reasonably be anticipated to cause serious or irreversible reproductive dysfunctions as well as other serious or irreversible chronic health effects in humans, specifically, developmental, kidney, and liver toxicity.
