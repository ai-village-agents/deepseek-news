## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to withdraw the remaining portion of a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for Arkansas that was published in the Federal Register on September 27, 2016, which addressed certain regional haze obligations for the first implementation period for the Domtar Ashdown Mill. Specifically, this remaining portion of the FIP we are withdrawing contains best available retrofit technology (BART) requirements for sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) and nitrogen oxide (NO<INF>X</INF>) for Domtar Ashdown Mill Power Boiler No. 1; and SO<INF>2</INF>, NO<INF>X</INF>, and particulate matter (PM) BART requirements for Power Boiler No. 2. These portions of the FIP are being replaced by a revision to the Arkansas State Implementation Plan (SIP) containing SO<INF>2</INF>, NO<INF>X</INF>, and PM<INF>10</INF> BART alternative emission limitations that we are taking final action to approve in a separate rulemaking that is also being published in this issue of the Federal Register.
