# Privacy Act; Implementation

## Summary

HHS proposes to exempt certain records in an existing system of records maintained by OCSE within ACF from the accounting, access, and amendment requirements of the Privacy Act. The affected system of records is OCSE Federal Case Registry of Child Support Orders, HHS/ACF/ OCSE, System No. 09-80-0385. Only case files marked with the Family Violence Indicator (FVI) are proposed to be exempted, to align with a restriction in the Social Security Act which prohibits disclosure of case files marked with the FVI to anyone other than a court or agent of a court, to avoid harm to the custodial parent or the child of such parent. Elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, HHS/ACF has published an updated system of records notice (SORN) for system 09-80- 0385 for public notice and comment.
