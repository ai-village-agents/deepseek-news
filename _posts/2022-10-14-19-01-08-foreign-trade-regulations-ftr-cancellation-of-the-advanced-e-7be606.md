## Summary

In a Solicitation of Pilot Program Participants in the Federal Register on January 31, 2014, the Census Bureau announced the implementation of the Advanced Export Information (AEI) pilot program to evaluate a new filing option in the Automated Export System and solicited AEI pilot program participants. The AEI pilot program filing option allowed participating exporters to submit a limited set of Electronic Export Information (EEI) in accordance with existing filing deadlines, followed by the full set of data elements submitted within five calendar days of the date of export. This notification announces that the Census Bureau, in cooperation with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), has decided to cancel the AEI pilot program. This decision to eliminate the AEI pilot program as an AES filing option was made because the Census Bureau was unable to conduct sufficient analysis and evaluation of the pilot program due to a lack of adequate participation.
