The records in the new system of records are about individual healthcare providers who have applied for Federal certification under the Community Health Aide Program (CHAP) created under the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, as amended; and individuals serving as CHAP Certification Board members who review and evaluate the certification/recertification applications for completeness and verify that the candidates meet the minimum standards for certification. The CHAP Certification Board will provide the respective Area Director with its recommendation to either certify, recertify, or deny certification after reviewing the certification applications.
