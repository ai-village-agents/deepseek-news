## Summary

As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) requests comments on a proposed extension of approval of information collection to obtain data on consumer product-related injuries, and follow-up activities for product-related injuries. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) previously approved the collection of information under control number 3041-0029. OMB's most recent extension of approval will expire on May 31, 2025. The Commission will consider all comments received in response to this notice before requesting an extension of this collection of information from OMB.
