## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bell Textron Canada Limited Model 429 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of incorrectly installed lockwire on the stability and control augmentation system (SCAS) actuator jam nut. This proposed AD would require inspecting the installation of the lockwire on the SCAS actuator jam nut and, if the lockwire is incorrectly installed, removing the lockwire and installing a new lockwire correctly. This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of an affected SCAS actuator assembly unless certain requirements are met. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
