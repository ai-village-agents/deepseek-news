## Summary

We, the Fish and Wildlife Service, announce receipt of applications from Joseph Pianalto, Jeffrey W. Floyd, and Robert Holzberger (applicants) for separate incidental take permits (ITP), pursuant to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the National Environmental Policy Act under the approved general conservation plan (GCP) and final environmental impact statement for the Alabama beach mouse. A GCP is a mechanism that meets the definition of a conservation plan in section 10(a)(1)(B) of the ESA and enables the construction of a programmatic permitting and conservation process to address a defined suite of proposed activities over a defined planning area. Each applicant requests an ITP to take the federally listed Alabama beach mouse incidental to the construction of a single-family home in Baldwin County, Alabama. We invite public comment from the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies.
