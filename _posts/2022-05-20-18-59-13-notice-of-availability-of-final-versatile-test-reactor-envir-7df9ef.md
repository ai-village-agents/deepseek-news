The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE or the Department) announces the availability of the Final Versatile Test Reactor Environmental Impact Statement (VTR EIS) (DOE/EIS-0542). DOE prepared the VTR EIS in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of alternatives for constructing and operating VTR and associated facilities for post- irradiation examination of irradiated test specimens and the management of VTR spent nuclear fuel. The Final VTR EIS also evaluates the potential environmental impacts of options for production of VTR driver fuel (the fuel that powers the reactor).
