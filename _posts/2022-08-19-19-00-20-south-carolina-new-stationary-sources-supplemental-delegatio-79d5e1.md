# South Carolina; New Stationary Sources; Supplemental Delegation of Authority

## Summary

On September 23, 2021, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC or State agency) requested to change its delegation mechanism from "adopt-by-reference" to "automatic" for delegation of New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) under our regulations. The purpose of the State agency request for approval of the "automatic" delegation mechanism is to facilitate consistency with the State agency's "automatic" delegation mechanism for implementation and enforcement of National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants rules. With this NSPS delegation mechanism in place, once a new or revised rule is promulgated by EPA, delegation of authority from EPA to the State agency will become effective on the date the rule is promulgated. No further State requests for delegation will be necessary. Likewise, no further Federal Register notices will be published. EPA reserves the right to implement the federal NSPS directly and continues to retain concurrent enforcement authority. EPA is providing notice that it approved SCDHEC's request on January 17, 2022.
