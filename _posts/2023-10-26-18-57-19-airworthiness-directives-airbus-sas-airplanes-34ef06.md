## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-01-07, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and - 1041 airplanes. AD 2022-01-07 requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-01-07, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would retain the actions required by AD 2022-01-07 and also require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
