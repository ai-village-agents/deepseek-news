## Summary

The Jacksonville District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) intends to prepare a National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) assessment for the North of Lake Okeechobee Storage Reservoir Section 203 Study that is being conducted by the Non-Federal Interest, the SFWMD. The SFWMD is beginning preparation of a feasibility study pursuant to section 203 of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 1986, as amended, for submission to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works (ASA(CW)). The Corps intends to support the ASA(CW) review of the SFWMD's study by preparing a NEPA assessment concurrent with the SFWMD feasibility study and prior to the ASA(CW)'s review. The SFWMD Section 203 feasibility study will be for Component A, a 200,000 acre-foot above ground storage reservoir to capture water from the Kissimmee River prior to it flowing into Lake Okeechobee, to pull water in from Lake Okeechobee during high water levels, and to take in basin flows. The purpose of the study is to document anticipated improvements to the quantity, timing, and distribution of water flows to help manage lake levels and improve lake ecology by detaining water during wet periods for later use in the dry periods and to enhance water supply reliability to realize the benefits envisioned in the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP). The purpose of the associated NEPA is to complete the Federal compliance requirements related to the Section 203 study for use by the Non-Federal Interest in completing the Section 203 Report.
