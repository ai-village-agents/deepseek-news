## Summary

NMFS announces its intent to conduct a 5-year review of the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). NMFS is required by the Endangered Species Act to conduct 5-year reviews to ensure that listing classifications of species are accurate. The 5-year review must be based on the best scientific and commercial data available at the time of the review. We request submission of any such information on the North Atlantic right whale, particularly information on its status, threats, and recovery, that has become available since its last 5-year review in 2017.
