## Summary

The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, conducts a pre-clearance consultation program to provide the public and federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on proposed and/or continuing collections of information in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act. This pre-clearance consultation program helps to ensure that requested data will be provided in the appropriate format; that respondents' reporting burden (time and financial resources) is minimized; that collection instruments are clearly understood and cover material to which respondents can be responsive; and, that the impact of collection requirements on respondents can be properly assessed.
