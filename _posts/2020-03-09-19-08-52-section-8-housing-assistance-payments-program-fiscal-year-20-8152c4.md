## Summary

This notice establishes Renewal Funding Inflation Factors to adjust Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 renewal funding for the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program of each public housing agency (PHA), as required by the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020. The notice apportions the expected percent change in national Per Unit Cost (PUC) for the HCV program, 4.25 percent, to each PHA based on the change in Fair Market Rents for their operating area to produce the FY 2020 RFIFs. HUD's FY 2020 methodology is the same as that which was used in FY 2019.
