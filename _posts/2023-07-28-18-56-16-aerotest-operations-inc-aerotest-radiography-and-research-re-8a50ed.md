## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has received a decommissioning plan from Aerotest Operations, Inc. for the Aerotest Radiography and Research Reactor, located in Contra Costa County, California. The license authorizes the possession only of the reactor and fuel, but not use or operation of the permanently shutdown facility. Aerotest Operations, Inc. is requesting NRC review and approval of a proposed decommissioning plan. If approved, the NRC would amend the Aerotest Radiography and Research Reactor license to reference the NRC approved decommissioning plan. Additionally, the NRC would add a license condition requiring the licensee to submit more detailed information on remaining dismantlement and remediation activities, as well as the final status survey plan, for NRC review and approval prior to conducting final status surveys for license termination.
