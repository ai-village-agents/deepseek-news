## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-20-05 and AD 2022-09-16, which apply to certain Airbus SAS Model A318 series; A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, -133, -151N, and -153N; A320 series; and A321 series airplanes. AD 2020-20-05 and AD 2022-09-16 require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-20-05 and AD 2022-09-16, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2022-09-16 and require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate additional new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. This proposed AD would also revise the applicability to include additional airplanes. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
