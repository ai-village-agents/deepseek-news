## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that the path for the grounding wire of the engine fire shut off valve (FSOV) is routed through the wing trailing edge, which is not the shortest path available. This AD requires modifying the wiring between the inboard fixed leading edge in the wing and in the forward cargo compartment on the left- and right-hand sides, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
