## Summary

We are adopting amendments to the rule under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") that provides affirmative defenses to trading on the basis of material nonpublic information in insider trading cases. The amendments add new conditions to this rule that are designed to address concerns about abuse of the rule to trade securities opportunistically on the basis of material nonpublic information in ways that harm investors and undermine the integrity of the securities markets. We are also adopting new disclosure requirements regarding the insider trading policies and procedures of issuers, the adoption and termination (including modification) of plans that are intended to meet the rule's conditions for establishing an affirmative defense, and certain other similar trading arrangements by directors and officers. In addition, we are adopting amendments to the disclosure requirements for director and executive compensation regarding equity compensation awards made close in time to the issuer's disclosure of material nonpublic information. Finally, we are adopting amendments to Forms 4 and 5 to require filers to identify transactions made pursuant to a plan intended to meet the rule's conditions for establishing an affirmative defense, and to require disclosure of bona fide gifts of securities on Form 4.
