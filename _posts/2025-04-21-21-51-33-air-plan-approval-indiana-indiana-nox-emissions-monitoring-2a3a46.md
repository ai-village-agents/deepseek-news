## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve under the Clean Air Act (CAA) a request from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) to revise the Indiana State Implementation Plan (SIP) to incorporate revisions to nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) emissions monitoring, reporting and record keeping requirements for new and existing large non-Electric Generating Units (non-EGUs) affected by the NO<INF>X</INF> SIP Call. This SIP revision would approve monitoring, reporting, and record keeping requirements that are permissible as alternatives under Federal rules for these sources for purposes of the NO<INF>X</INF> SIP Call.
