## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for the re-entry of a space vehicle from the Starship Super Heavy launch by Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (Space X). The temporary safety zone is located within the Coast Guard District Fourteen area of responsibility, approximately 129 nautical miles offshore of Oahu, Hawaii. The purpose of this rule is to ensure the safety of vessels, mariners, and the navigable waters in the safety zones before, during, and after the scheduled event. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of vessels and waterway users from the potential hazards created by reentry vehicle splashdowns and recovery operations in our exclusive economic zone. It is also necessary to provide for the safe recovery of reentry vehicles, and any personnel involved in reentry services, after the splashdown. This rule implements a special activities provision of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. Foreign-flagged vessels are encouraged to remain outside the safety zones. This rule prohibits U.S. flagged vessels from being in the safety zones unless authorized by the Commander of the Fourteenth Coast Guard District or a designated representative.
