## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 747-100, 747-100B, 747-100B SUD, 747- 200B, 747-200C, 747-200F, 747-300, 747-400, 747-400D, 747-400F, and 747SR series airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of inboard foreflap departures from the airplane. This AD requires repetitive replacement of certain parts; a general visual inspection to determine production configuration for certain parts; a repetitive lubrication of certain parts and a repetitive general visual inspection of certain parts for any exuding grease; repetitive detailed inspections of certain parts for loose or missing attachment bolts, cracks or bushing migration, cracks or gouges, or broken, binding, or missing rollers; repetitive detailed inspections of certain parts for cracks or corrosion; repetitive lubrication; and on-condition actions if necessary.
