## Summary

On April 12, 2022, the Department of Commerce (Commerce) initiated an administrative review of the antidumping duty (AD) order on certain frozen warmwater shrimp (shrimp) from India for the period February 1, 2021, through January 31, 2022, for 261 companies. Because all interested parties timely withdrew their requests for administrative review for certain companies, we are rescinding this administrative review with respect to those companies. For a list of the companies for which we are rescinding this review, see Appendix I to this notice. For a list of the companies for which the review is continuing, see Appendix II to this notice.
