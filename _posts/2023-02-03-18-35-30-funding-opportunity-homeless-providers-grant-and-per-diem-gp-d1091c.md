## Summary

VA is announcing the availability of approximately $15 million per year for up to 2 years, pending availability of funding and grantee performance, in new grants under the case management component of the VA Homeless Providers GPD program. Applications for grants are being accepted from eligible entities to support case management services. These time-limited case management services will improve retention of housing by Veterans who are at risk of becoming homeless or who were previously homeless and are transitioning to permanent housing from programs such as VA's Homeless Providers GPD program or VA's Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) Contracted Residential Services (CRS) program. VA anticipates that the grants will be for a period of 2 years, starting in fiscal year (FY) 2024 on October 1, 2023, and ending on September 30, 2025. VA anticipates awarding approximately 100 grants for up to a total of approximately 150 full-time equivalent case (FTE) manager positions nationwide. Awards may be up to $300,000 total costs per FTE case manager position, with funding requests broken out by year 1 and year 2. This NOFO contains information concerning the program, application process, available funding, selection criteria and award process.
