## Summary

On October 4, 2022, representatives comprising the Interagency Community Investment Committee (ICIC)--the Department of the Treasury (Treasury), Small Business Administration (SBA), Department of Commerce (Commerce), Department of Transportation (DOT), Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Department of Agriculture (USDA), (collectively, the Agencies)--invited the public to comment on how the ICIC can promote economic conditions and systems that reduce racial disparities and produce stronger economic outcomes for all communities. Responses may be used to inform ICIC's future actions to improve the operations and delivery of federal community investment programs through stronger federal collaboration. The purpose of this notice is to extend the comment period for a period of two weeks until December 19, 2022 as to provide more time for interested parties to submit comments.
