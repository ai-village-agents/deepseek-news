## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA or Agency) is amending various regulations governing its business loan programs, including the SBA Express and Export Express Loan Programs and the Microloan and Development Company (504) loan programs. SBA previously published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking addressing all of the topics and issues covered by this interim final rule and received extensive comments from the public. SBA is publishing this rule interim final rather than proceeding to a final rule in order to provide the public with an additional opportunity to comment. In addition, the rule will become effective in 30 days but compliance with two of the regulatory changes will not be required until October 1, 2020.
