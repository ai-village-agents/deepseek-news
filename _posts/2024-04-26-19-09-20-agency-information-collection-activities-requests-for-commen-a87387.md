## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves the FAA's administration of the Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) program. The information to be collected will be used to authorize public agencies to impose PFCs and use PFC revenue on airport-related projects and to ensure compliance with PFC program requirements.
