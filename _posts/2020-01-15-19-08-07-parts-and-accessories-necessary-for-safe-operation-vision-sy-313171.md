## Summary

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) announces its decision to grant Vision Systems North America, Inc.'s (VSNA) application for a limited 5-year exemption to allow motor carriers to operate commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) with the company's Smart-Vision high definition camera monitoring system (Smart-Vision) installed as an alternative to the two rear-vision mirrors required by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs). The Agency has determined that granting the exemption to allow use of the Smart-Vision system in lieu of mirrors would likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to or greater than the level of safety provided by the regulation.
