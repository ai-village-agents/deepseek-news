## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing approval of a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Missouri on March 7, 2019. Missouri requests that the EPA approve revisions to a state regulation for the Restriction of Particulate Matter to the Ambient Air Beyond the Premises of Origin. These revisions include adding definitions that are specific to the rule, restructures the rule into the standard rule organization format, and removes unnecessary words. The revisions are administrative in nature and do not impact the stringency of the SIP or air quality. The EPA's proposed approval of this rule revision is in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
