## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-11-05, which applies to Bell Helicopter Textron Canada Limited (now Bell Textron Canada Limited) Model 429 helicopters having certain tail rotor (TR) pitch link assemblies. AD 2019-11-05 requires inspecting the TR pitch link assemblies, and replacing certain pitch link bearings. Since the FAA issued AD 2019-11-05, the FAA has determined that all TR pitch link assemblies are affected by the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions specified in AD 2019-11-05, and would revise the applicability and require inspections of certain other TR pitch link assemblies. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
