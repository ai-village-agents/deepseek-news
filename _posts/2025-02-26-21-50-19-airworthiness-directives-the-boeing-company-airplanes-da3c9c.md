## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports that very high frequency (VHF) radio frequencies transfer between the active and standby windows of the tuning control panel (TCP) without flightcrew input. The uncommanded frequency changes could result in missed communications between the flightcrew and Air Traffic Control. This proposed AD would require updating the TCP operational software (OPS) and performing a software configuration check. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
