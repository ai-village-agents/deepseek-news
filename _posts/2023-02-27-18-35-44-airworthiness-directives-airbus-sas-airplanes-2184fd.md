## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that an interference was detected between the installed nut and the foot radius of a section of a certain frame (FR) on the right-hand side. This AD requires removing the affected fasteners and inspecting the affected area for damage, and applicable corrective actions if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
