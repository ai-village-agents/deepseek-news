## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) is correcting a final rule that appeared in the Federal Register on July 14, 2023, which added a diisononyl phthalates (DINP) category to the list of toxic chemicals subject to the reporting requirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) and the Pollution Prevention Act (PPA). However, the amendment could not be incorporated into the regulation due to an inaccurate amendatory instruction. This document corrects the amendatory instructions.
