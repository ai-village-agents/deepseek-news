## Summary

This final rule implements the Pacific Halibut Catch Sharing Plan for the International Pacific Halibut Commission's regulatory Area 2A off Washington, Oregon, and California. In addition, this final rule implements management measures that are not implemented through the International Pacific Halibut Commission. These measures include the recreational fishery seasons and allocations, and other management measures for Area 2A, including some season dates that are different than proposed. This rule also announces that it may be necessary to further modify the opening dates or other fishing days for some subareas shortly after the publication of this final rule, in response to changes in state measures related to the spread of COVID-19. These actions are intended to conserve Pacific halibut and provide angler opportunity where available.
