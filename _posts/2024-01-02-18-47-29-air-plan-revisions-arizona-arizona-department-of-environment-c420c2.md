## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve two revisions to the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) portion of the Arizona State Implementation Plan (SIP). In this action, we are proposing to approve revisions submitted by the ADEQ governing the issuance of permits for stationary sources in accordance with changes that the EPA has made to its New Source Review (NSR) program regulations under the Clean Air Act (CAA or "the Act"). We are also proposing to determine that with these revisions, the ADEQ's NSR program satisfies the requirements for the preconstruction review and permitting of major sources and major modifications under part D of title I of the Act for areas designated nonattainment with the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) with a Marginal classification, for areas and sources within the ADEQ's permitting jurisdiction. We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
