## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Yoakum Municipal Airport, Yoakum, TX. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of an airspace review caused by the decommissioning of the Yoakum non- directional beacon (NDB). The geographic coordinates of the airport would also be updated to coincide with the FAAs aeronautical database.
