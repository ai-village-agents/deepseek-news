## Summary

By this rule, the Census Bureau is eliminating its regulations pertaining to a now-obsolete joint effort between the United States Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to train foreign nationals in census and statistical procedures. This action is necessary to ensure that the Census Bureau's regulations are accurate and up-to-date. The intended effect is to remove outdated and unnecessary regulatory content, to reduce the potential for confusion, and to reprioritize American interests.
