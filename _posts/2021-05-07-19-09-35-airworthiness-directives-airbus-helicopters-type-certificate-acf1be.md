## Summary

The FAA is revising a SNPRM for all Eurocopter France (now Airbus Helicopters) Model SA-365N, SA-365N1, AS-365N2, AS 365 N3, and SA-366G1 helicopters. The SNPRM retained the proposed requirements in the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) and added recurring inspections and references to an engineering report that lists approved U.S. alternative fasteners and materials that may be used in any required repairs. The FAA is reopening the comment period because a significant amount of time has elapsed since the SNPRM was published. This proposed AD would require measuring the 9-degree frame flange (frame) for the correct edge distance of the four attachment holes for the stretcher support and inspecting for cracks, and repairing the frame, if necessary, as specified in two Direction G[eacute]n[eacute]rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC) ADs, which are proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). This action also revises the SNPRM by updating the type certificate holder's name and estimated cost information. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive (AD) to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over those in the SNPRM, the agency is requesting comments on this SNPRM.
