## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish temporary special local regulations for certain waters of Back River. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters located in Baltimore County, MD, during a high-speed power boat event on July 16, 2022 (alternate date on July 17, 2022). This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the regulated area unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Maryland- National Capital Region or the Coast Guard Event Patrol Commander. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
