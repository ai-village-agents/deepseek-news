## Summary

This final rule updates payment rates, including implementing the second phase of the Patient Driven Payment Model (PDPM) parity adjustment recalibration. This final rule also updates the diagnosis code mappings used under PDPM, the SNF Quality Reporting Program (QRP), and the SNF Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program. We are also eliminating the requirement for facilities to actively waive their right to a hearing in writing, treating as a constructive waiver when the facility does not submit a request for hearing.
