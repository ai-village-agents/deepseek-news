## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is confirming the effective date of October 17, 2023, for the direct final rule that was published in the Federal Register on August 3, 2023. This direct final rule amended the spent fuel storage regulations by revising the NAC Multi-Purpose Canister (NAC-MPC) System listing within the "List of approved spent fuel storage casks" to renew, for 40 years, the initial certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 through 8 of Certificate of Compliance No. 1025. The renewal of the initial certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 through 8 revises the certificate of compliance's conditions and technical specifications to address aging management activities related to the structures, systems, and components important to safety of the dry storage system to ensure that these will maintain their intended functions during the period of extended storage operations.
