## Summary

The Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families proposes to amend the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) regulations. This notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) proposes changes to lower families' child care costs, which can be a significant financial strain for families and disincentivize work, training, and education. It proposes changes to improve child care provider payment rates and practices to increase parent choice for child care arrangements and help stabilize operations for participating providers. It also proposes ways for CCDF Lead Agencies to streamline eligibility and enrollment processes so families can receive child care assistance faster and so program bureaucracy is less likely to disrupt parent employment, training, and education and impede access to child care. The NPRM also includes technical and other changes to improve clarity and program implementation.
