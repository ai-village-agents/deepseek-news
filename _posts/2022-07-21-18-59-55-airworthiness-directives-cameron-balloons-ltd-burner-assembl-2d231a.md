## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Cameron Balloons Ltd. (Cameron) Stratus double burner assemblies installed on hot air balloons. This AD was prompted by reports from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as fatigue cracking of the weld on Stratus double burner hangers. This AD requires repetitively inspecting certain Stratus double burner hangers and replacing certain Stratus double burners, and prohibits installing certain parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
