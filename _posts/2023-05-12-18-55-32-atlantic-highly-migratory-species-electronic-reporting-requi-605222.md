## Summary

In this advance notice of proposed rulemaking, NMFS is considering management options to modify or expand reporting requirements for Atlantic highly migratory species (HMS). All HMS reporting would require electronic submission using an online or mobile reporting application. Specific to commercial vessel reporting, NMFS is considering options for electronic submission of information required on the existing, paper logbooks, as well as a logbook requirement for owners of vessels with Atlantic Tunas General category permits, Atlantic Tunas Harpoon category permits, and/or Swordfish General Commercial permits. Specific to recreational vessel reporting, NMFS is considering a logbook requirement for owners of HMS Charter/Headboat permitted vessels, as well as expanding HMS Angling permit reporting requirements. NMFS is also considering measures to encourage reporting compliance for vessel owners with HMS open access permits. Specific to dealer reporting, NMFS is considering requiring dealers to enter certain fish individually in their dealer reporting programs and a technical change in bluefin tuna (BFT) reporting requirements. Finally, specific to the HMS Exempted Fishing Permit (EFP) Program, NMFS is considering offering an electronic reporting platform, as well as some technical changes to reporting requirements.
