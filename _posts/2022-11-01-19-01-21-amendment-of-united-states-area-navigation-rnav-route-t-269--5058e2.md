## Summary

This action corrects a final rule published by the FAA in the Federal Register on October 24, 2022, that amends United States Area Navigation (RNAV) route T-269 in the vicinity of Yakutat, AK, in support of a large and comprehensive T-route modernization project for the state of Alaska. The final rule identified the KATAT, AK, route point as a waypoint (WP), in error. This action makes an editorial correction to the reference of the KATAT, AK, WP to change it to be reflected as a Fix and match the FAA's aeronautical database information.
