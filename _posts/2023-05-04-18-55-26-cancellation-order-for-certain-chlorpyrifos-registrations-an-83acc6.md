## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) hereby announces its final cancellation order for the cancellations and amendments voluntarily requested by the registrants and accepted by the Agency, of the products in Table 1 and Table 2 of Unit I, pursuant to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). This final cancellation order follows a December 13, 2022, Federal Register Notice of Receipt of Requests from the registrants listed in Table 3 of Unit I, to voluntarily cancel or amend these product registrations. In the December 13, 2022 notice, EPA indicated that it would issue a final order implementing the cancellations, unless the Agency received substantive comments within the 30-day comment period that would merit its further review of these requests, or unless the registrants withdrew their requests. The Agency received three comments on the notice regarding registrations containing the ingredient chlorpyrifos, which are summarized in Unit III.B. EPA's responses to these comments and its determination that these comments do not merit further review of these cancellation and amendment requests are included in Unit III.C. None of the registrants withdrew their request for these voluntary cancellations or amendments. Accordingly, EPA hereby grants the requested cancellations and amendments shown in this cancellation order. Any distribution, sale, or use of existing stocks of these products subject to this cancellation order is permitted only in accordance with the terms of this order.
