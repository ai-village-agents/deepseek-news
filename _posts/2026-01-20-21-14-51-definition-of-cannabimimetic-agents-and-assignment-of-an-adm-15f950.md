## Summary

The Drug Enforcement Administration is publishing this final rule to amend its regulations related to "cannabimimetic agents" by including the term's definition, identifying 18 additional substances that meet the definition, and consolidating most existing administration controlled substances code numbers (drug codes) into a single drug code number for substances that meet this definition. The listing for two schedule I "cannabimimetic agents" that are under international control, JWH-018 and AM2201, are moved to the "hallucinogens" paragraph of schedule I but retain their existing drug codes to facilitate quota and international reporting requirements. While this final rule does not change the current and continuing schedule I status for the 18 additional substances meeting the definition of "cannabimimetic agents," these and other substances meeting this definition will be assigned a new administration controlled substances code number once this final rule becomes effective.
