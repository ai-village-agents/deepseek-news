## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-04- 09, which applied to certain AVOX Systems Inc. (formerly Scott Aviation) oxygen cylinder and valve assemblies; and oxygen valve assemblies; installed on but not limited to various transport airplanes. AD 2022-04-09 required an inspection of the oxygen valve assemblies, and oxygen cylinder and valve assemblies, to determine the serial number; for certain assemblies and parts, a detailed inspection of the gap between the bottom of the packing retainer and top of the valve body on the assemblies; and replacement of assemblies having unacceptable gaps. This AD was prompted by a determination that additional assemblies and parts are affected by the unsafe condition. This AD requires an inspection of the oxygen valve assemblies, and oxygen cylinder and valve assemblies, to determine the serial number of the valve, cylinder, and entire assembly; for certain assemblies and parts, a detailed inspection for correct spacing of the gap between the bottom of the packing retainer and top of the valve body on the assemblies and replacement of assemblies having unacceptable gaps. This AD also limits the installation of affected parts under certain conditions and reporting inspection results and returning certain assemblies to the manufacturer. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
