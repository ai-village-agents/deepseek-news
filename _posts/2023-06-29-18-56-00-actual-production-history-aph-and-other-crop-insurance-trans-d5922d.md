## Summary

The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) is amending its regulations to incorporate existing actual production history (APH) requirements into the policy to enhance and improve accessibility, clarity, and transparency for the producer. FCIC is also incorporating existing same year production reporting (SYPR) rules into the policy, clarifying prevented planting rules, incorporating the High-Risk Alternate Coverage Endorsement (HR-ACE) into the policy, clarifying double cropping requirements when another plan of insurance does not require records of acreage and production, and updating organic provisions. In this rule, FCIC is authorizing the availability of enterprise units (EU) and whole farm units (WFU) to be designated in the actuarial documents. The changes to the crop insurance policies resulting from the amendments in this rule are applicable for the 2024 and succeeding crop years for crops with a contract change date on or after June 30, 2023. For all other crops, the changes to the policies made in this rule are applicable for the 2025 and succeeding crop years.
