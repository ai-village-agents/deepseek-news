## Summary

NMFS issues these proposed regulations to remove the Cordell Bank Groundfish Conservation Area off central California for all groundfish fisheries and implement a new Groundfish Exclusion Area for all groundfish fisheries to protect sensitive habitat. The purpose of this proposed rule is to simplify regulatory complexity associated with overlapping fishery closures in the Cordell Bank area, and to increase fishing opportunity, while still protecting the Cordell Bank ecosystem. NMFS also announces the availability of a draft environmental assessment that analyzes the potential effects of the proposed rule.
