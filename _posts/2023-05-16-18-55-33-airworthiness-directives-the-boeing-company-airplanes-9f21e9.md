## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-05-06 and AD 2021-08-19, which both applied to certain The Boeing Company Model 787-8, -9, and -10 airplanes. AD 2018-05-06 required repetitive inspections of the bilge barriers located in the forward and aft cargo compartments for disengaged decompression panels, and reinstalling any disengaged panels; and required replacing the existing decompression panels with new panels and straps, which terminated the repetitive inspections. AD 2021-08-19 required repetitive general visual inspections for disengaged or damaged decompression panels of the bilge barriers located in the forward and aft cargo compartments, reinstallation of disengaged but undamaged panels, and replacement of damaged panels. This AD was prompted by reports of multiple incidents of torn decompression panels found in the bilge area, and the development of new procedures for changing or replacing the bilge barrier assembly in the forward and aft cargo compartments. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2021-08-19 and requires changing or replacing the bilge barrier assembly in the forward and aft cargo compartments, which terminates the repetitive inspections. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
