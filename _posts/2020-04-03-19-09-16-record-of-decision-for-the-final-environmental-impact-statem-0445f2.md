We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce the availability of a record of decision (ROD) for the proposed issuance of an Endangered Species Act (ESA) permit for the Skookumchuck Wind Energy Project (project) and final habitat conservation plan (HCP). The ROD documents the Service's decision to issue an incidental take permit (ITP) to Skookumchuck Wind Energy Project, LLC (applicant). As summarized in the ROD, the Service has selected Alternative 1--the Proposed Action, which includes implementation of the HCP and issuance of the ITP authorizing incidental take of one threatened species listed under the ESA and two species protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (BGEPA) that may occur as a result of operation of the project over a 30-year period.
