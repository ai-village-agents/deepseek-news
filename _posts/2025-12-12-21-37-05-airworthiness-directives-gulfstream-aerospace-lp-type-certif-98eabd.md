## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Gulfstream Aerospace LP Model Gulfstream 100, Astra SPX, and 1125 Westwind Astra airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that new airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new airworthiness limitations. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
