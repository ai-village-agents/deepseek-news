## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-24- 04, which applied to all The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. AD 2020-24-04 required revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to incorporate procedures for an approach with a localizer-based navigation aid, monitoring localizer raw data, calling out any significant deviations, and performing an immediate go around under certain conditions. This AD was prompted by the development of a modification to address the previously identified unsafe condition, and the identification of a separate unsafe condition where misleading vertical flight director (FD) guidance can be presented to the flightcrew under certain conditions. This AD continues to require the actions specified in AD 2020-24-04 and requires installing applicable software updates to the flight control module (FCM). Using updated software terminates the retained AFM requirement in this AD. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
