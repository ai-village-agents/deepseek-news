## Summary

The Bureau of the Census (Census Bureau) will conduct a 2020 Census Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS) tribal consultation meeting on May 19, 2021, via a national webinar. The tribal consultation meeting reflects the Census Bureau's continuous commitment to strengthen government-to-government relationships with federally recognized tribes. The Census Bureau's procedures for outreach, notice, and consultation ensure involvement of tribes, to the extent practicable and permitted by law, before making decisions or implementing policies, rules, or programs that affect federally recognized tribal governments. These meetings are open to citizens of federally recognized tribes by invitation.
