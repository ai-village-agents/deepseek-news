## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a revision to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) consisting of State rules intended to reduce particulate matter (PM) and oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) emissions from public transit buses. The EPA is approving the SIP revision because the regulations meet the applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act. Approval of the regulations as part of the California SIP makes them federally enforceable.
