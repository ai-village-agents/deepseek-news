## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are announcing the availability of documents related to an application for an enhancement of survival permit (permit) under the Endangered Species Act. Farmland Reserve, Inc. (FRI) and AgReserves, Inc. (ARI) (collectively referred to as DLL) have applied for a permit associated with the implementation of a candidate conservation agreement with assurances (CCAA) for the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) for the Deseret Land and Livestock (DLL Ranch) in Utah. The purpose of this CCAA is for the Service to join with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources and DLL (collectively, the parties to this CCAA), to implement conservation measures for greater sage-grouse in a manner that is consistent with the Service's Policy on CCAAs and applicable Service regulations. The documents available for review and comment are the applicant's CCAA, which is part of the permit application, and our draft environmental action statement and low- effect screening form, which support a categorical exclusion under the National Environmental Policy Act. We invite comments from the public and Federal, Tribal, State, and local governments.
