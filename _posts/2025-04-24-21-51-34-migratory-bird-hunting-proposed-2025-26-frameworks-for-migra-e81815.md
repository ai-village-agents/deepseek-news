## Summary

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service or we) is proposing to establish the frameworks from which States may select season dates, limits, and other options for the 2025-26 migratory game bird hunting season. We annually prescribe outside limits (which we call frameworks) within which States may select hunting seasons. Frameworks specify the outside dates, season lengths, shooting hours, bag and possession limits, and areas where migratory game bird hunting may occur. These frameworks are necessary to allow State selections of seasons and limits and to allow harvest at levels compatible with migratory game bird population status and habitat conditions. Migratory game bird hunting seasons provide opportunities for recreation and sustenance and aid Federal, State, and Tribal governments in the management of migratory game birds.
