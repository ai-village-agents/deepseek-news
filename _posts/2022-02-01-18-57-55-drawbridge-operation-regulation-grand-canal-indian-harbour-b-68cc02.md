## Summary

The Coast Guard has issued a temporary deviation from the operating schedule that governs the Lansing Island Bridge across Grand Canal, mile 0.7 at Indian Harbour Beach, FL. A request was made to the Coast Guard to allow the drawbridge to remain closed to navigation and untended during the overnight hours due to a lack of requested openings. This deviation will test a change to the drawbridge operation schedule to determine whether a permanent change to the schedule is needed. The Coast Guard is seeking comments from the public regarding these temporary changes.
