## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-11-15 for certain International Aero Engines AG (IAE) V2500 model turbofan engines. AD 2021-11-15 required performance of an ultrasonic inspection (USI) of the high-pressure turbine (HPT) 1st-stage disk and HPT 2nd- stage disk and, depending on the results of the inspections, replacement of the HPT 1st-stage disk or HPT 2nd-stage disk. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-11-15, the FAA determined the need to clarify the compliance time for inspection of any HPT 1st-stage disk or HPT 2nd- stage disk that is installed on a low-thrust model engine but had been previously operated on a high-thrust model engine. This AD requires performance of a USI of the HPT 1st-stage disk and HPT 2nd-stage disk and, depending on the results of the inspections, replacement of the HPT 1st-stage disk or HPT 2nd-stage disk. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
