## Summary

Pursuant to the Pork Promotion, Research, and Consumer Information Act of 1985 (Act) and the Pork Promotion, Research, and Consumer Information Order (Order) thereunder, this proposed rule would decrease the current rate of assessment of the market value of live porcine animals and decrease the amount of assessment per pound due on imported pork and pork products. These reductions in assessment rates are made in response to the increase in the average prices of live hogs and reflect the National Pork Producers Delegate Body's (Delegate Body) desire to lessen the assessment burden on producers and make such funds available to pork producers and the industry. The adjustment in importer assessments also would bring the equivalent market value of live animals from which imported pork and pork products are derived in line with the market value of domestic porcine animals. A Harmonized Tariff Schedule number for prepared or preserved pork also would be updated in the regulation.
