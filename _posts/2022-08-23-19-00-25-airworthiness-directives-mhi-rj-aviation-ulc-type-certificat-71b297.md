## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain MHI RJ Aviation ULC Model CL-600-2B19 (Regional Jet Series 100 & 440) airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that a certain nondestructive test (NDT) procedure associated with a certain airworthiness limitation for inspecting surface and subsurface fatigue cracks at certain fuselage stations does not address all required inspections. This AD requires using a revised NDT procedure when performing an airworthiness limitation task. This AD also prohibits the use of earlier revisions of that NDT procedure. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
