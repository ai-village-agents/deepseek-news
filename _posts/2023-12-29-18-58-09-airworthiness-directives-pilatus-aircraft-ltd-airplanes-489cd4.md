## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Pilatus Aircraft Ltd. (Pilatus) Model PC-24 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that the titanium threaded bolts at the forward end of the short rudder trim tab actuating rods could be subject to unexpectedly high oscillating loads due to aerodynamic forces acting on the rudder trim tab. This AD requires periodic replacement of affected titanium threaded bolts, a one-time inspection of the rudder mass balance arm and other elements of the rudder trim tab installation for correct attachment, damage (gouges), cracks, deformation, surface finish, and corrosion on any surrounding parts and, depending on findings, accomplishment of applicable corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) emergency AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
