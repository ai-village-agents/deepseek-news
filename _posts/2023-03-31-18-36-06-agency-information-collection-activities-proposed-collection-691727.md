## Summary

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, invites the general public to take this opportunity to comment on an extension, without change, of a currently approved information collection. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice seeks comments concerning FEMA's Individual and Community Preparedness Division's (ICPD) efforts to enable individuals, organizations, or other groups to register with FEMA and to take part in FEMA's preparedness mission by connecting with individuals, organizations, and communities with research and tools to build and sustain capabilities to prepare for any disaster or emergency.
