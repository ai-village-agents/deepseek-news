## Summary

This document amends the FM Table of Allotments, of the Commission's rules, by removing Channel 265C2 at Millerton, Oklahoma; Channel 293C2 at Powers, Oregon; Channel 279A at Mount Enterprise, Texas; Channel 296C3 at Paint Rock, Texas; Channel 290A at Hardwick, Vermont; and Channel 259C at Meeteetse, Wyoming. All of these allotments were offered in previous FM auctions and received no bids. We will not delete Channel 259C2 at Snowflake, Arizona, because Estrella Broadcasting LLC filed a bona fide expression of interest.
