## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is proposing to amend the standard of identity and standard of fill of container for canned tuna. This action partially responds to a citizen petition submitted by Bumble Bee Foods, LLC, StarKist Co., and Tri Union Seafoods, LLC (doing business as Chicken of the Sea International). We tentatively conclude that this action, if finalized, will promote honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers.
