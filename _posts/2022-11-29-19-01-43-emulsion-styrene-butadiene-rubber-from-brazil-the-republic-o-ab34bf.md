## Summary

As a result of these expedited sunset reviews, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) finds that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) orders on emulsion styrene-butadiene rubber (ESB rubber) from Brazil, the Republic of Korea (Korea), Mexico, and Poland would be likely to lead to the continuation or recurrence of dumping at the levels indicated in the "Final Results of Sunset Review" section of this notice.
