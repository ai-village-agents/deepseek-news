## Summary

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) is amending its restricted area regulations to establish a restricted area within the Richardson Training Area on Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson (JBER), at Eagle River. The restricted area is located in the area of navigable waters extending from the span of Bravo Bridge across Eagle River to the mouth of Eagle River at Knik Arm (Eagle River channel). Establishment of the restricted area will prevent all vessels, watercraft, and individuals from entering an active military range munitions impact area at all times, except for authorized vessels, watercraft, and individuals engaged in support of military training and management activities. The restricted area will avoid inadvertent entry into the impact area during live-fire weapons training, exposure to hazardous noise, and inadvertent encounters with unexploded ordnance.
