## Summary

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is working across government and with the private sector to address counterfeiting and piracy. As part of that effort, the USPTO wants to learn what interested parties are observing and seeks their insights into anticounterfeiting and antipiracy strategies. In particular, the USPTO requests information on current anticounterfeiting and antipiracy strategies that have proven effective, as well as ideas for future strategies. To facilitate discussion among members of the public regarding the future of anticounterfeiting and antipiracy, the USPTO will host a roundtable on the topics listed in this notice on October 3. Any additional roundtables will be announced through the Federal Register.
