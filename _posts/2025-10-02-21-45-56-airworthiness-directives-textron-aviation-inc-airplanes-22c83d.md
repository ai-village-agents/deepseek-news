## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Textron Aviation Inc. (Textron) Model B200GT, B200CGT, B300, and B300C airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of rudder control pushrod failure during a production ground run, caused by sheared rivets off of a rudder control pushrod. This AD requires a visual inspection of the attaching rivets of the pilot and copilot rudder control pushrods for incorrect rivets and replacement if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
