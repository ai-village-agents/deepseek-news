## Summary

The Commission invites comments from the public on whether changed circumstances exist sufficient to warrant the institution of a review pursuant to section 751(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1675(b)) (the Act) regarding the Commission's affirmative determinations in investigation Nos. 701-TA-471 and 731-TA-1170 (Final). The purpose of the proposed review would be to determine whether revocation of the existing antidumping and countervailing duty orders on imports of coated paper suitable for high-quality print graphics using sheet-fed presses (certain coated paper) from Indonesia would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury (19 U.S.C. 1675(b)(2)(A)).
