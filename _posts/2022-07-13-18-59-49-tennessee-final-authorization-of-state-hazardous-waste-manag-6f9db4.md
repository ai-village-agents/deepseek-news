## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to authorize changes to Tennessee's hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). These changes were outlined in an application to the EPA and correspond to certain Federal rules promulgated between January 1, 1983 and June 30, 2021. The EPA reviewed Tennessee's application and has determined that these changes satisfy all requirements needed to qualify for final authorization. Therefore, in the "Rules and Regulations" section of this Federal Register, we are authorizing Tennessee for these changes as a direct final rule without a prior proposed rule. If we receive no adverse comment, we will not take further action on this proposed rule.
