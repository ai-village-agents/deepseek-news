## Summary

We are advising the public of our decision to authorize the importation into the United States of fresh pummelo fruit from Vietnam. Based on the findings of a pest risk analysis, which we made available to the public for review and comment through a previous notice, we have determined that the application of one or more designated phytosanitary measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks of introducing or disseminating plant pests or noxious weeds via the importation of fresh pummelo fruit from Vietnam.
