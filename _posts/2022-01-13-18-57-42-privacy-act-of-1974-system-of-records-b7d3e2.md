## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) is giving notice that it proposes to modify a system of records pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. This system will use SORN EPA-38. EPA-38 will be modified to change the name from Invention Reports to Federal Technology Transfer Act (FTTA) and Inventory for Patent Inventions (IfPI). Additionally, EPA is modifying the location, ownership, and categories of records in the FTTA and IfPI system. The purpose of the system is to provide the opportunity for the knowledge and expertise within the Agency to be shared with outside entities through collaborative agreements and licensing. Records are maintained for the purpose of documenting inventions made under EPA sponsorship, including filing patent applications, determining rights to inventions, licensing inventions, and ascertaining inventorship and priority of invention. Unless noted in this modification, all exemptions and provisions included in the previously published system of record notice for Invention Reports will transfer to the modified system of record notice for Federal Technology Transfer Act (FTTA) and Inventory for Patent Inventions (IfPI).
