# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Canada Limited Partnership (Type Certificate Previously Held by C Series Aircraft Limited Partnership (CSALP); Bombardier, Inc.) Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD- 500-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of mechanical wear damage on the motive flow fuel-feed tubes that were secured by bonding clamps and clamp blocks inside the collector tank. This proposed AD would require repetitive operational checks of the gravity cross flow shut-off valve and, for certain airplanes, a one- time inspection of the motive flow fuel-feed tubes at the clamp blocks location, and corrective action if necessary, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
