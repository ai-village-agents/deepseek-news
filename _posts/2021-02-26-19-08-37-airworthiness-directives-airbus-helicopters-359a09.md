# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-03-12, which applies to certain Airbus Helicopters Model EC225LP helicopters. AD 2019-03-12 requires repetitively inspecting, cleaning, and lubricating each life raft inflation cylinder percussion system bellcrank (bellcrank). Since the FAA issued AD 2019-03-12, the FAA determined that any affected bellcrank must be replaced with a serviceable bellcrank, which would terminate the repetitive actions. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions specified in AD 2019-03-12, and would require replacing any affected bellcrank with a serviceable bellcrank. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
