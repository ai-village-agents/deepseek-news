## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Viking Air Limited (type certificate previously held by Bombardier Inc.) Model DHC-3 airplanes with a certain wing strut assembly installed. This AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as fatigue damage of the wing struts. This AD requires a bolt hole eddy current inspection of the lug plate holes, a visual and fluorescent dye penetrant inspection of the lug fittings, and a visual and eddy current surface scan inspection of the wing strut assemblies. This unsafe condition could lead to failure of the wing strut, which could result in an in- flight breakup of the wing. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
