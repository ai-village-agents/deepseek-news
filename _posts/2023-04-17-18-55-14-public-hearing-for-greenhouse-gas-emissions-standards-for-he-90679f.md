## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing a two- day virtual public hearing to be held May 2 and May 3, 2023, on its proposal titled "Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards for Heavy-Duty Vehicles--Phase 3," which was signed by Administrator Regan on April 11, 2023. An additional session may be held on May 4, 2023, if necessary to accommodate the number of testifiers that sign up to testify. In its proposal, EPA is proposing to promulgate new Greenhouse Gas (GHG) standards for heavy-duty highway vehicles starting in model year (MY) 2028 through MY 2032 and to revise certain GHG standards for MY 2027 that were established previously under EPA's Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Medium- and Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles--Phase 2 rule. Finally, as part of this action, EPA is proposing to revise its regulations addressing preemption of state regulation of locomotives.
