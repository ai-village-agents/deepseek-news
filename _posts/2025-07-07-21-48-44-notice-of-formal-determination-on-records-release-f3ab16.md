## Summary

The Civil Rights Cold Case Records Review Board received 4,106 pages of records from the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the Department of Justice, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) related to four civil rights cold case incidents to which the Review Board assigned the unique identifiers 2024-003-011, 2024-003-028, 2024-003-046, and 2024-003-064. NARA, the Department of Justice, and the FBI proposed 936 postponements in the records related to incidents 2024-003-011 and 2024-003-046. The Department of Justice and the FBI later withdrew 175 of the postponements the agencies proposed after consultation with the Review Board. On June 20, 2025 and June 27, 2025, the Review Board met and approved 264 postponements and portions of 63 additional postponements, and determined that 3,959 pages in full and 147 pages in part should be publicly disclosed in the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection. By issuing this notice, the Review Board complies with the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018 that requires the Review Board to publish in the Federal Register its determinations on the disclosure or postponement of records in the Collection no more than 14 days after the date of its decision.
