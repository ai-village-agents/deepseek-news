## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled "HIV prevention among Latina transgender women who have sex with men: Evaluation of a locally developed intervention". The collection is part of a research study designed to evaluate the efficacy of a locally developed and culturally congruent two-session Spanish-language small-group intervention, ChiCAS (Chicas Creando Acceso a la Salud [Chicas: Girls Creating Access to Health]), which provides combination HIV prention services to adult Hispanic/Latina transgender women at high risk for HIV infection.
