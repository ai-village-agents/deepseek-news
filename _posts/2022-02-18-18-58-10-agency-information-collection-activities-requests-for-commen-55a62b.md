## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves obtaining basic information from new aviation insurance applicants about eligible aviation insurance applicants needed to establish a legally binding, non-premium insurance policy with the FAA, as requested by another Federal agency, such as the applicants name and address, and the aircraft to be covered by the policy. The information collected will be used to determine whether applicants are eligible for Chapter 443 insurance and the amount of coverage necessary; populate non-premium insurance policies with the legal name and address; and meet conditions of coverage required by each insurance policy. As a condition of coverage, air carriers will be required to submit any changes to the basic information initially submitted on the application, as necessary. Air carriers will also be responsible for providing a copy of their current commercial insurance policy on an ongoing basis, and aircraft registration and serial numbers for any new aircraft the air carrier would like to add to the policy. This information will form part of a legally binding agreement (i.e., insurance policy) between the FAA and air carrier. Failure to provide this updated information could result in lack or denial of coverage.
