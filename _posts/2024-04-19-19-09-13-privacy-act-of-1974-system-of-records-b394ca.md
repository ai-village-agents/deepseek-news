## Summary

The Privacy Act of 1974 and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-108 requires that each agency publish notice of a new or modified system of records that it maintains. This notice proposes to modify an existing system of records to add three additional statutes to the "Authority" section of the system, and to add two new routine uses and revise one routine use for the Department of Labor (DOL), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Retaliation Complaint File, DOL/OSHA-1, as well as to make general updates to provide more detail and clarity regarding OSHA's practices for disclosing, storing, retaining, and disposing of records in this system and the technical, physical, and administrative safeguards that OSHA relies on to protect records in this system from unauthorized disclosure.
