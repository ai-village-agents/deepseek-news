## Summary

Notice is hereby given of a public hearing to receive evidence on proposals recommended by the South Texas Onion Committee (Committee) to amend Federal Marketing Order No. 959 (Order). The proposed amendments would lower the threshold for continuance referenda; expand research and promotion authority to include marketing promotion and paid advertising; add authority to accept voluntary contributions; and increase committee size by one seat to include a public member. The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) also proposes to make additional changes to the Order as may be necessary to conform to any amendatory changes that result from the hearing.
