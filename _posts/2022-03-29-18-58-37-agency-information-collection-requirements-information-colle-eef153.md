## Summary

The OCC, as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, invites the general public and other Federal agencies to take this opportunity to comment on the renewal of two information collections as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA). In accordance with the requirements of the PRA, the OCC may not conduct or sponsor, and the respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The OCC is soliciting comment concerning the renewal of its information collections titled, "Request for a Religious Exception to the COVID-19 Vaccine Requirement;" and "Request for a Medical Exception to the COVID-19 Vaccine Requirement." The OCC is also giving notice that it has sent the collection to OMB for review.
