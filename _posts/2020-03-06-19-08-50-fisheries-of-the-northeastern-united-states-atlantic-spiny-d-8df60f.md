## Summary

We are implementing specifications for the 2020 spiny dogfish fishery, including an annual catch limit and commercial quota. This action is necessary to ensure allowable harvest levels to prevent overfishing while allowing harvest of optimum yield, consistent with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. This action is intended to establish 2020 specifications, consistent with the Spiny Dogfish Fishery Management Plan and previously announced multi-year specifications.
