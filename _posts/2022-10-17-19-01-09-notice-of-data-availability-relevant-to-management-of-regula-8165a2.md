## Summary

This Notice of Data Availability (NODA) is to alert stakeholders of information from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regarding the United States' hydrofluorocarbon reclamation market and to solicit stakeholder input. The Agency is making available a draft report, Analysis of the U.S. Hydrofluorocarbon Reclamation Market: Stakeholders, Drivers, and Practices, which analyzes the United States' hydrofluorocarbon reclamation market and describes the reclamation process, factors affecting costs of reclamation, incentives, and barriers to refrigerant reclamation. The Agency is providing this information in preparation for an upcoming regulatory action which EPA intends to propose under subsection (h) of the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act of 2020. The notice identifies possible data gaps and requests comment on areas where additional information could improve the Agency's information on the United States hydrofluorocarbon reclamation market and practices. The Agency is also providing notice of a stakeholder meeting to enable stakeholders to provide input as the Agency prepares to engage in rulemaking.
