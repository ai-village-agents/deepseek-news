## Summary

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) segregated public lands included in the right-of-way application (N-099406) for the Rough Hat Clark County Solar Project from appropriation under the public land laws, including the Mining Law, but not the mineral leasing or material sales acts, for a period of 2 years on October 20, 2021, subject to valid existing rights. This 2-year extension of the segregation is necessary to allow the BLM to complete review of the Rough Hat Clark County Solar Project application and reach a decision on the application.
