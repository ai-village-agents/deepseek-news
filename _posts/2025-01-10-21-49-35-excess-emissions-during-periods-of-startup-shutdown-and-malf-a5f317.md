## Summary

Due to the receipt of adverse comment, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is withdrawing the November 26, 2024, direct final rule to partially withdraw two final actions finding that 13 States and/or local air pollution control agencies failed to submit State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions required by the Clean Air Act (CAA) in a timely manner to address the EPA's 2015 findings of substantial inadequacy and "SIP calls" for provisions applying to excess emissions during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM). The EPA will address all comments received in a subsequent final rule for which the EPA will not institute a second comment period.
