## Summary

NMFS published a final rule on October 3, 2022, announcing a Federal requirement for certain vessels in the Pacific Coast Groundfish fishery target fishing for groundfish with non-trawl gear in Federal waters seaward of California, Oregon, and Washington, to complete and submit a non-trawl logbook to NMFS via an electronic application (87 FR 59724). This correction is necessary to modify a regulatory instruction so that the implementing regulations are accurate. This correction is also necessary to clarify the methods by which fishermen can record required information while on a fishing trip.
