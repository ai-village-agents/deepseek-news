## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports that certain lower torque links of the nose landing gear (NLG) were manufactured without bright shot peening; the omission of bright shot peening could result in reduced fatigue life of the parts. This AD requires replacement of affected parts before exceeding their reduced life limit and limits the installation of affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
