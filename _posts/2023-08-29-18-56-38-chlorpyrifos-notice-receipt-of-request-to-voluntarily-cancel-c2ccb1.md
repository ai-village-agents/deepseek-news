## Summary

In accordance with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), EPA is issuing a notice of receipt of requests by Loveland Products, Inc. (hereafter referred to as Loveland) to voluntarily cancel registrations of certain products containing the pesticide chlorpyrifos. EPA intends to grant these requests at the close of the comment period for this announcement unless the Agency receives substantive comments within the comment period that would merit its further review of the requests, or the registrant withdraws their request. If these requests are granted, any sale, distribution, or use of the products listed in this notice after the registrations have been cancelled would need to be consistent with the terms as described in the final cancellation order.
