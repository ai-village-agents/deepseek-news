## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its spent fuel storage regulations by revising the TN Americas LLC Standardized NUHOMS[supreg] Horizontal Modular Storage System listing within the "List of approved spent fuel storage casks" to include Renewed Amendment No. 17 to Certificate of Compliance No. 1004. Because this amendment is subsequent to the renewal of the TN Americas LLC Standardized NUHOMS[supreg] Horizontal Modular System Certificate of Compliance No. 1004 and, therefore, subject to the Aging Management Program requirements of the renewed certificate, it is referred to as "Renewed Amendment No. 17." Renewed Amendment No. 17 revises the certificate of compliance technical specifications to add Heat Load Zoning Configurations 11-13 for the 61BTH Type 2 dry shielded canister and change the maximum assembly heat load from 1.2 kW to 1.7 kW. This amendment also makes minor clarifications to the certificate of compliance.
