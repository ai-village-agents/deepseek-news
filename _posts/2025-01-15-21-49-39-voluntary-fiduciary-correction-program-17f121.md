## Summary

This document contains an amended and restated Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program (VFC Program or Program) under title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). The VFC Program is designed to encourage correction of fiduciary breaches and compliance with the law by permitting persons to avoid potential Department of Labor civil enforcement actions and civil penalties if they voluntarily correct eligible transactions in a manner that meets the requirements of the Program. The amendments to the Program simplify and expand the VFC Program to make the Program easier to use and more useful for employers and others who wish to avail themselves of the relief provided. Specifically, the Program amendments add a self-correction feature for delinquent transmittal of participant contributions and loan repayments to a pension plan under certain circumstances; clarify some existing transactions eligible for correction under the Program; expand the scope of other transactions currently eligible for correction; and simplify certain administrative or procedural requirements for participation in and correction of transactions under the VFC Program. In addition, the amendments implement section 305(b)(2) and (3) of the SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 (SECURE 2.0 Act) by adding a self-correction feature for certain participant loan failures self-corrected under the Internal Revenue Service's Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (as described in Rev. Proc. 2021-30, or any successor guidance) (IRS's EPCRS).
