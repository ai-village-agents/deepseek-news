## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to establish a new DHS system of records titled, "Department of Homeland Security/U.S. Customs and Border Protection-026 Explorer Program System of Records." This system of records allows the DHS/U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to collect and maintain records on individuals who apply for, participate in, or sponsor a minor dependent for the CBP Law Enforcement Explorer Program, a work-based volunteer program for young adults interested in learning about law enforcement. The program gives individuals ages 14- 18 the opportunity to learn about law enforcement careers and serves as a stepping-stone for a career in law enforcement. The Explorer Program is chartered by Learning for Life/Boy Scouts of America as an educational resource program and sponsored by CBP as a personnel recruitment program. This newly established system will be included in the Department of Homeland Security's inventory of record systems.
