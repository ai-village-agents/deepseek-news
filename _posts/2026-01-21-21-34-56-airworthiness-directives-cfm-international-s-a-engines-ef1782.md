## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-19-16 for all CFM International, S.A. (CFM) Model LEAP-1A23, -1A24, -1A24E1, -1A26, -1A26E1, -1A26CJ, -1A29, -1A29CJ, -1A30, -1A32, -1A33, -1A33B2, and -1A35A engines with certain full authority digital engine control (FADEC) and prognostic health monitoring (PHM) software installed. AD 2018-19-16 required removing certain FADEC and PHM software and installing versions eligible for installation. Since the FAA issued AD 2018-19-16, the manufacturer has developed a new pressure subsystem (PSS) with a heater element to evaporate potential moisture on the PSS manifold/transducer interface and prevent freezing at low temperature. This AD requires replacing certain FADEC and PHM software with new versions that are eligible for installation, replacing certain harnesses with newly designed harnesses, and replacing the PSS with a newly designed heated PSS. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
