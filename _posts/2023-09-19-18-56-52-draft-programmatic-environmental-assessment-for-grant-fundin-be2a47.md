## Summary

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Justice Programs (OJP) has completed a Draft Programmatic Environmental Assessment (PEA). The OJP provides federal leadership, grants, training, technical assistance and other resources to improve the nation's capacity to prevent and reduce crime, assist victims and uphold the rule of law by strengthening the criminal and juvenile justice systems. The PEA evaluates the potential environmental impacts of implementing OJP programs that provide funding to applicants in support of OJP's mission. NEPA requires that federal agencies consider the effects of a proposed action and any reasonable alternatives on the human environment. This Draft PEA evaluates the impacts that would result from the implementation of the Proposed Action as compared to the No Action alternative. OJP is accepting comments on this Draft PEA as detailed below.
