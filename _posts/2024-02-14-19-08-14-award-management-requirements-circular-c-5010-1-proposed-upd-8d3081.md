## Summary

The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) is seeking public comment on proposed updates to FTA's Award Management Requirements circular (C 5010.1). The proposed updates combine requirements applicable to all FTA financial assistance awards (referred to as "cross-cutting" requirements) and, when final, will supersede parts of three separate FTA circulars (the proposed "Grant Programs for Urbanized Areas", "Formula Grants for Rural Areas" (C 9040.1G), and "Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities" (C 9070.1G)). The proposed updates also reflect changes made by the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act; the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL)); the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards; and other updates to FTA policies and procedures.
