## Summary

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Family Assistance (OFA), has had administrative responsibility for federal funding of programs that strengthen families through healthy marriage and relationship education and responsible fatherhood programming since 2006 through the Healthy Marriage (HM) and Responsible Fatherhood (RF) grant programs. ACF required the 2015 and 2020 cohorts of HMRF grant recipients to collect and report performance measures about program operations, services, and participants (Office of Management and Budget (OMB) #: 0970-0460 and OMB #: 0970-0566). ACF will continue performance measure data collection and reporting for a new cohort of HMRF grant recipients that received 5-year awards in September 2025. ACF is requesting comment on a revision to its approved data collection and reporting (OMB #: 0970-0566) to support these activities with the 2025 HMRF grant cohort. This new cohort is expected to begin collecting performance measure data and reporting to ACF in April 2026. ACF is requesting to extend approval, with the implementation of revisions described below, for 3 years.
