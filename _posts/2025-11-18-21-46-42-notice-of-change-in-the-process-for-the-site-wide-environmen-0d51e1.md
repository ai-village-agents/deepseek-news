## Summary

The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a semi- autonomous agency within the United States (U.S.) Department of Energy (DOE), announces it will not perform certain National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) activities previously indicated in the Notice of Intent To Prepare a Site-Wide Environmental Impact Statement (SWEIS) for Continued Operation of Sandia National Laboratories, New Mexico (SNL/NM) in Albuquerque, New Mexico (SNL/NM NOI) and the Notice of Intent To Prepare a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) for Enhanced Plutonium Facility Utilization at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in Livermore, California (LLNL NOI). Due to intervening regulatory changes, NNSA will not publish a draft SNL/NM SWEIS or a draft LLNL SEIS or hold additional public hearings for the LLNL SEIS. When NNSA publishes the final SNL/NM SWEIS and the final LLNL SEIS, NNSA will publish its Records of Decision (RODs) for both at the same time as the final documents.
