## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) on behalf of the State of Maryland (Maryland). This revision certifies that Maryland's existing nonattainment new source review (NNSR) program, covering the Baltimore nonattainment area, the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City nonattainment area, and the Washington, DC nonattainment area for the 2008 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS), is at least as stringent as applicable Federal requirements. EPA is proposing to approve this revision in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA). Additionally, EPA is withdrawing a prior proposed approval of a related Maryland SIP submittal regarding ozone interprecursor trading.
