## Summary

This final rule implements certain provisions of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (CAA). Additionally, we are proposing to delete references to specific Medicare forms from the text of existing regulations at Sec. Sec. 406.7 and 407.11 in order to provide greater administrative flexibility. Finally, this final rule updates the various federal regulations that affect a State's payment of Medicare Part A and B premiums for beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicare Savings Programs and other Medicaid eligibility groups.
