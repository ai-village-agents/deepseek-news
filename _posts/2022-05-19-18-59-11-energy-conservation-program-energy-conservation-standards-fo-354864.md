## Summary

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended ("EPCA"), prescribes energy conservation standards for certain commercial and industrial equipment, including commercial water heaters, hot water supply boilers, and unfired hot water storage tanks (hereinafter referred to as "commercial water heating (CWH) equipment"). EPCA requires the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") to periodically determine whether more-stringent standards for CWH equipment would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would result in significant energy savings. In this notice of proposed rulemaking ("NOPR"), DOE proposes to amend the standards for certain classes of CWH equipment for which DOE has tentatively determined there is clear and convincing evidence to support more-stringent standards. Additionally, DOE is proposing to codify standards for electric instantaneous CWH equipment from EPCA into the Code of Federal Regulations ("CFR"). DOE also announces a public meeting to receive comment on these proposed standards and the associated analyses and results.
