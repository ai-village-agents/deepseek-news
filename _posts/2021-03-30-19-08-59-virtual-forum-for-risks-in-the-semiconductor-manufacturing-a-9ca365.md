## Summary

On February 24, 2021, President Biden issued the Executive Order on "America's Supply Chains," which directs several Federal agency actions to secure and strengthen America's supply chains. One of these directions is for the Secretary of Commerce to submit, within 100 days, a report to the President identifying risks in the semiconductor manufacturing and advanced packaging supply chains, and proposing policy recommendations to address these risks. Additionally, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021 includes a title for "Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America" that mandates several Federal actions in securing the semiconductor- related supply chain. On March 15, 2021, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) published a notice of request for public comments, Risks in the Semiconductor Manufacturing and Advanced Packaging Supply Chain (March 15 notice). The March 15 notice requests written comments and information from the public to assist the Department of Commerce in preparing the report required by the Executive Order with written comments due by April 5, 2021. BIS is publishing today's notice to announce a virtual forum that will occur on April 8, 2021, that will allow participants to orally address the policy objectives listed in the Executive Order as they affect the U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and advanced packaging supply chains, including but not limited to the elements included in the March 15 notice. Today's notice sets forth the procedures for public participation in the virtual forum.
