## Summary

FMCSA announces that it has received an application for exemption from The Trucking Alliance, a group comprised of the following motor carriers: Cargo Transporters; Dupr[eacute] Logistics LLC; Frozen Food Express; J.B. Hunt Transport, Inc.; KLLM Transport Services; Knight Transportation; Maverick Transportation LLC; Schneider; Swift Transportation; USXpress; and May Trucking Company. The Trucking Alliance applied for an exemption from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) "to amend the definition of actual knowledge to include the employer's knowledge of a driver's positive hair test, which would require such results be reported to the FMCSA Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse ("Clearinghouse") and to inquiring carriers." Although FMCSA lacks the statutory authority to grant the Trucking Alliance's request for exemption until the Department of Health and Human Services has taken certain action, FMCSA requests public comment on the exemption application, as required by statute.
