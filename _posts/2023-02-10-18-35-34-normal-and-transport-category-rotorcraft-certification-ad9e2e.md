## Summary

The FAA is amending the certification standards of normal and transport category rotorcraft. These changes are necessary to address modern designs currently used in the rotorcraft industry and will reduce the burden on applicants for certification of new rotorcraft designs. The changes will reduce or eliminate the need for certain special conditions currently required to obtain certification of modern rotorcraft. These changes also incorporate the provisions of equivalent level of safety findings and means of compliance issue papers that the FAA has made when approving certain design features.
