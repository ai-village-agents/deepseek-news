## Summary

The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is issuing guidance for the acceptance and use of geomatic information obtained from a non-Federal entity. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, H.R. 3684, Title I Federal-Aid Highways, Subtitle C, directs the Secretary to develop guidance for the acceptance and use of geomatic information obtained from a non-federal entity. DOT's Geospatial Management Office (GMO) recognizes the need for a geomatic information standard to meet this requirement.
