## Summary

This proposal presents the results of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) residual risk and technology review (RTR) for the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for major source Primary Copper Smelters as required under the Clean Air Act (CAA). Pursuant to the CAA, this action also presents the results of the technology review for the Primary Copper Smelting area source NESHAP. The EPA is proposing new emissions standards in the major source NESHAP. The EPA is also proposing to remove exemptions for periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) and specify that the emission standards apply at all times and require electronic reporting of performance test results and notification of compliance reports.
