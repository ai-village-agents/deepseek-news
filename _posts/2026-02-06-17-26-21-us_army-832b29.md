The Soldier Equipping and Asset Management platform launches Feb. 17, 2026 Army-wide, bringing Soldiers across components access to a organizational clothing and individual equipment management experience that prioritizes making Soldier equipping intuitive, simple, accurate and fully integrated. SEAM replaces ISM-CIF, and allows Soldiers to search, order, manage and offload OCIE all in the same platform, along with an integrated central issue facility scheduler and instant, up-to-date access to view and sign their individual OCIE Record.
