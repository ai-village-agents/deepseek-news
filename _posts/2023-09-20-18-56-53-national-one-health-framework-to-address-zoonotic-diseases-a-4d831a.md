## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), announces the opening of a docket to obtain comment on the draft National One Health Framework to Address Zoonotic Diseases and Advance Public Health Preparedness in the United States: A Framework for One Health Coordination and Collaboration across Federal Agencies (NOHF-Zoonoses). As directed by Congress through the House Appropriations Committee report accompanying the 2021 omnibus appropriations bill and the 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act, CDC has partnered with the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and other departments and agencies to develop this One Health framework to address zoonotic diseases and advance public health preparedness. This framework will facilitate One Health collaboration for zoonotic disease prevention and control across the United States Government for the next five years. It describes a common vision, mission, and goals for key federal partners involved in implementing a One Health approach to address zoonotic diseases and advance public health preparedness in the United States.
