## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (AHD) Model MBB-BK 117 C-2 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of excessively worn bolts that connect the cardan-pivot joint with the piston rod of the tail rotor actuator (TRA) assembly. This proposed AD would require repetitively inspecting certain TRA assemblies, and depending on the results, replacing or repairing parts, or accomplishing additional inspections. This proposed AD would also prohibit installing an affected TRA assembly unless it passes required inspections. Lastly, this proposed AD would provide terminating actions for certain inspections, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
