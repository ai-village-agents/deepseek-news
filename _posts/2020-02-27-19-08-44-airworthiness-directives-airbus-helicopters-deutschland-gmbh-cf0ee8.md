## Summary

The FAA is revising an earlier proposal for Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (Airbus Helicopters) Model MBB-BK 117 C-2 and Model MBB-BK 117 D-2 helicopters. This action revises the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) by changing one of the required actions. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive (AD) to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions impose an additional burden over that proposed in the NPRM, the FAA is reopening the comment period to allow the public the chance to comment on these proposed changes.
