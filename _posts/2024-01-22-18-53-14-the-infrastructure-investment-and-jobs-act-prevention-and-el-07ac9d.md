## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) adopts rules pursuant to section 60506 of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Infrastructure Act) that establish a framework to facilitate equal access to broadband internet access service by preventing digital discrimination of access. These rules address policies and practices that impede equal access to broadband, while taking into account issues of technical and economic feasibility that pose serious challenges to full achievement of the equal access objective. The rules constitute an effective, balanced means to accomplish Congress's objective of ensuring that historically unserved and underserved communities throughout the Nation have equal opportunity to receive high-speed broadband service comparable to that received by others, without discrimination as to the terms and conditions on which that service is received.
