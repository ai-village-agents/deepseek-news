## Summary

This rule updates obsolete nomenclature in the regulations under the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921 (Act). Obsolete references to the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) are changed to the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). References to Packers and Stockyards Programs, Packers and Stockyards Administration, and other obsolete terms are likewise changed to reflect the USDA's, AMS's, and the Packers and Stockyards Division's current organizational structure. Administration of Packers and Stockyards (P&S) activities under the Act was transferred to AMS in 2017.
