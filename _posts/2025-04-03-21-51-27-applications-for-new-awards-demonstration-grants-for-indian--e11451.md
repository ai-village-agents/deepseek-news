## Summary

On January 17, 2025, the Department of Education (Department) published in the Federal Register a notice inviting applications (NIA) for the fiscal year (FY) 2025 Demonstration Grants for Indian Children and Youth Program (Demonstration program) competition. The Department is correcting the NIA by amending the Background information, editing Table 1, revising a requirement to reflect the precise statutory language, and amending certain selection criteria. In addition, we are updating the dates of the pre-application webinars and extending the deadline date for the transmittal of applications together with the intergovernmental review deadline. All other information in the NIA remains the same.
