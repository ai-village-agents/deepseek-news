## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce a 90-day finding on two concurrently filed companion petitions to revise the currently listed gray wolf (Canis lupus) entities under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act or ESA). Together, the petitions requested that the Service: designate and delist a Western Great Lakes (WGL) distinct population segment (DPS) of gray wolf due to recovery; and designate a West Coast States DPS of gray wolf and list it as a threatened species, and potentially delist the remnant areas of the gray wolf entity in the lower 48 States due to extinction. Based on our review, we find that the petitions do not present substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned actions may be warranted.
