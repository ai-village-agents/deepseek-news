## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to amend a special local regulation for certain waters of the Patapsco River, in Baltimore, MD by adding a new period during which this regulation would be subject to enforcement. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters during the 3rd and 4th weeks of June, during Fleet Week events. This rule would prohibit persons and vessels from entering the regulated area during this enforcement period unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Maryland-National Capital Region or the Coast Guard Patrol Commander.
