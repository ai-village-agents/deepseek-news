## Summary

GSA is issuing a final rule amending the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) to clarify the calculation of "constructive cost" as it relates to temporary duty (TDY) travel. GSA is also making technical changes regarding what method of transportation agencies should compare privately owned vehicle costs to when preparing a constructive cost analysis. These clarifications are intended to produce better estimates for agency decision makers.
