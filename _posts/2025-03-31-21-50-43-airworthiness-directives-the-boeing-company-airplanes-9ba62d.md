## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-26-03, which applies to all The Boeing Company Model 757-200 series airplanes. AD 2018-26-03 requires, for the Captain's and First Officer's seats, repetitive horizontal actuator identifications, repetitive checks of the horizontal movement system (HMS), a detailed inspection of the HMS, as applicable, and applicable on-condition actions. AD 2018-26-03 also requires a general visual inspection to determine the seat part numbers of the Captain's and First Officer's seats, a cable adjustment check on seats with certain seat part numbers, and applicable on-condition actions. Since the FAA issued AD 2018-26-03, the FAA has determined that additional seats are affected by the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would retain the actions required by AD 2018-26-03 and add an inspection for previously omitted part numbers. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
