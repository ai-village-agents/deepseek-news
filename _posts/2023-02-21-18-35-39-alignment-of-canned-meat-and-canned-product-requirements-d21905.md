# Alignment of Canned Meat and Canned Product Requirements

## Summary

We are revising the regulations for cured or cooked meat from regions where foot-and-mouth disease exists to reflect changes to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) regulations regarding thermally processed, commercially sterile meat. This action will remove from our regulations reference to a section in FSIS' regulations that was eliminated when FSIS consolidated their regulations regarding thermally processed, commercially sterile meat. This action will align the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service's animal product regulations with the current FSIS regulations.
