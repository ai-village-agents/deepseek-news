## Summary

The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC" or "Commission") proposes to amend the Ophthalmic Practice Rules ("Eyeglass Rule " or "Rule") to require that prescribers obtain a signed confirmation after releasing an eyeglass prescription to a patient, and maintain each such confirmation for a period of not less than three years. The Commission also proposes to permit prescribers to comply with automatic prescription release via electronic delivery in certain circumstances. The Commission further proposes a clarification that the presentation of proof of insurance coverage shall be deemed to be a payment for the purpose of determining when a prescription must be provided. Finally, the Commission proposes to amend the term "eye examination" to "refractive eye examination" throughout the Rule. The Commission seeks comment on these proposals.
