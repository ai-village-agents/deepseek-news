## Summary

The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) requests input to help inform the development of a National Strategy for Microgravity Research and Development (R&D) to ensure sustainability of space-based research during and beyond microgravity platform transition--from the International Space Station (ISS) to future commercial platforms. This particular request seeks information regarding the future vision of a robust research ecosystem in low-earth orbit (LEO) and the role of the U.S. government in enabling that future.
