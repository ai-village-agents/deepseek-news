## Summary

The Department of the Army (Army) announces the availability of a Final Environmental Impact Statement (Final EIS) regarding its proposed action to retain up to approximately 22,750 acres of the 23,000 acres of land the Army currently leases from the State of Hawai[revaps]i ("State-owned land") at P[omacr]hakuloa Training Area (PTA) on the island of Hawai`i. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Hawai`i Environmental Policy Act (HEPA), the Final EIS analyzes the potential direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of a range of reasonable alternatives that meet the purpose of and need for the proposed action. Because the proposed action involves State-owned land, the EIS is a joint NEPA-HEPA document that meets both NEPA and HEPA requirements. The Army will observe a 30- day waiting period before deciding how much land, if any, it will seek to retain.
