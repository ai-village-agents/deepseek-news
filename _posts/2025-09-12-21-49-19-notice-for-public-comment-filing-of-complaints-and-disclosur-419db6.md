## Summary

The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) is seeking approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for the proposed extension of a currently approved information collection used to file complaints and disclosures with OSC (Form OSC-14/dynamic electronic form). OMB first approved OSC's dynamic electronic filing form on September 18, 2017. OSC revised the previously approved form in July 2019 to reflect interim statutory changes and obtained emergency OMB/ OIRA processing for that collection. A final rule authorizing use of Form OSC-14 took effect on August 26, 2019, and OMB approval on February 3, 2020, authorized use of the revised form through March 2023. The collection was subsequently re-approved through February 28, 2026. OSC now seeks to extend approval through 2029. No substantive changes to the form or collection methodology are proposed with this extension.
