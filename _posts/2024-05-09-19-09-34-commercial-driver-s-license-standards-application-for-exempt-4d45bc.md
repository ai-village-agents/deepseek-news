## Summary

FMCSA announces its denial of the application from Pitt Ohio Express, LLC (Pitt Ohio) to exempt its drivers from one of the requirements in the Agency's Safe Driver Apprenticeship Pilot (SDAP) program. Pitt Ohio requests an exemption allowing it to use drivers under the age 21, who hold a Commercial Learner's Permit (CLP) to operate commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) in interstate commerce, to participate in the SDAP program. FMCSA analyzed the application and determined that there is insufficient basis to conclude that the exemption would likely achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent such exemption.
