## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("Commission") is proposing to amend the Commission's regulations under the Commodity Exchange Act ("CEA" or "Act") that govern how registered entities submit self-certifications, and requests for approval, of their rules, rule amendments, and new products for trading and clearing, as well as the Commission's review and processing of such submissions.
