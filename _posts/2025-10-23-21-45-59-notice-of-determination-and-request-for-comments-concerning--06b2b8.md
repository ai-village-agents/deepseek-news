## Summary

The United States Trade Representative (U.S. Trade Representative) has determined that Nicaragua's acts, policies, and practices related to labor rights, human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law are unreasonable and burden or restrict U.S. commerce, and are therefore actionable under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. The U.S. Trade Representative is proposing a range of actions, including but not limited to suspension, withdrawal, or prevention of application of benefits of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) to Nicaragua, and additional duties of up to 100 percent on some or all products of Nicaragua. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) seeks public comments on these proposed actions.
