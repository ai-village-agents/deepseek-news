## Summary

The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is announcing adjusted user fee rates for the costs of providing certain goods and services, including veterinary diagnostic goods and services and veterinary services for imports and exports of live animals and animal products. This action is necessary because the regulations provide that APHIS will issue such a notice. This action ensures that the fees charged more closely align with the costs of providing the goods or services, thus ensuring program solvency.
