## Summary

The National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) has released for public review draft updates to the Submission Guidelines related to equity. Federal and non-Federal agency applicants whose development proposals and plans are subject to statutory mandated Commission plan and project review must submit their proposals to the Commission following a process laid out in the Submission Guidelines. The proposed updates to the Submission Guidelines support the forthcoming updates to the Introduction Chapter of the Comprehensive Plan for the National Capital: Federal Elements. A Notice of a 90-day Public Comment Period and Public meetings relating to the revised update to the Introduction to the Comprehensive Plan for the National Capital: Federal Elements to address equity is published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register. The draft updates to the Submission Guidelines are available online for review at https://www.ncpc.gov/initiatives/intro. NCPC will host two public information sessions for the public to learn more about the draft updates to the Submission Guidelines.
