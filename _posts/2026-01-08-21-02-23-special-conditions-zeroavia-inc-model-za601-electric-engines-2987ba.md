## Summary

This action proposes special conditions for ZeroAvia, Inc. (ZeroAvia) Model ZA601 electric engines that operate using electrical technology installed on the aircraft for use as an aircraft engine. These engines will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for aircraft engines. The design feature is an electrical system that will power a mechanical rotating shaft to provide propulsion for airplanes which will be certified separately from the engine. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These proposed special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
