## Summary

This Notice advises the public that the Indian Health Service (IHS) proposes to view the seven Mid-Atlantic Tribes in the Commonwealth of Virginia collectively and to expand the geographic boundaries of their current Purchased/Referred Care Delivery Areas (PRCDA). The seven Mid-Atlantic Tribes include the Pamunkey Indian Tribe, Chickahominy Indian Tribe, Chickahominy Indian Tribe--Eastern Division, Upper Mattaponi Tribe, Rappahannock Tribe, Monacan Indian Nation, and Nansemond Indian Tribe. The IHS previously designated a PRCDA for each of the seven Tribes, which include counties and/or independent cities in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The IHS is now proposing to expand those individual PRCDAs by creating a collective PRCDA for the seven Tribes. The collective PRCDA will include all of the counties and independent cities in each of the current PRCDAs, plus additional contiguous counties and independent cities in the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of Maryland, and the State of North Carolina.
