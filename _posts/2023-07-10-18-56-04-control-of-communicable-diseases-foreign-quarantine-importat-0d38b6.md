## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), proposes to amend its foreign quarantine regulation to provide additional clarity and safeguards to address the public health risk of dog-maintained rabies virus variant (DMRVV) associated with the importation of dogs into the United States. The United States has been DMRVV-free since 2007, and reintroduction poses significant risk to human and animal health. The close relationship between dogs and people means there is a direct public health risk to individuals that interact with inadequately vaccinated dogs imported from countries at high risk of DMRVV (high- risk countries). The notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) also addresses the importation of cats because both dogs and cats are included in the current regulation. Cats are not required to have proof of rabies vaccination and CDC is not proposing new substantive changes relating to the importation of cats.
