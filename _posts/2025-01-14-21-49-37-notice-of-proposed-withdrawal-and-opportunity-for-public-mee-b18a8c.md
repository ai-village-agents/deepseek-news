## Summary

The Secretary of the Interior proposes to withdraw approximately 1,805 acres of public lands in the Las Vegas Valley from settlement, sale, location, or entry under the public land laws, including from location and entry under the United States mining laws, but not from disposal of mineral materials under the mineral materials disposal laws or leasing under the mineral and geothermal leasing laws, for a period of up to 20 years, subject to valid existing rights. The purpose of the withdrawal would be to protect the natural and cultural resources in the lands adjacent to the Las Vegas Tribe of Paiute Indians of the Las Vegas Indian Colony, Clark County, Nevada. The lands would remain under the management of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Publication of this notice temporarily segregates the land for up to 2 years from settlement, sale, location, or entry under the public land laws, including from location and entry under the United States mining laws, subject to valid existing rights, while the application is being processed. The notice initiates a 90-day public comment period and announces an opportunity to request a public meeting regarding the withdrawal proposal.
