## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all BRP-Rotax GmbH & Co KG (Rotax) Model 912 F2, 912 F3, 912 F4, 912 iSc2 Sport, 912 iSc3 Sport, 912 S2, 912 S3, 912 S4, 914 F2, 914 F3, and 914 F4 engines; and Model 912 A, 912 A2, and 912 A3 engines included as part of the type certificated aircraft type design for various aircraft. This AD was prompted by a report of surface abnormalities on the affected propeller shaft, which could lead to increased wear of the propeller shaft bearings. This AD requires initial and repetitive inspections of the magnetic plug for the accumulation of metal chips to assess the condition of the propeller gearbox for wear of the propeller shaft bearings and removal of the affected propeller shaft from service and replacement with a part eligible for installation as a terminating action either immediately or at a certain time depending on inspection findings. This AD also prohibits installation of the affected propeller shaft on any engine. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
