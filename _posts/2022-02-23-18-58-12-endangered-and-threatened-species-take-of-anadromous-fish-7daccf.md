## Summary

Notice is hereby given that the Hoopa Valley Tribe has provided a Tribal Resource Management Plan (TRMP) to NMFS pursuant to the limitation on take prohibitions for actions conducted under Tribal Plans promulgated under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The TRMP specifies harvest, research, and monitoring activities for tribal fisheries affecting ESA-listed Southern Oregon/Northern California Coast coho salmon in the portion of the Trinity River within the Hoopa Valley Reservation. NMFS has prepared a Proposed Evaluation and Pending Determination (PEPD) as to whether implementation of the TRMP will appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery of ESA- listed salmon and steelhead and an Environmental Assessment (EA) on the NMFS determination. Notice is hereby given that the PEPD and EA are available for public review and comment prior to NMFS making a final determination.
