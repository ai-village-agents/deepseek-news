# Pesticides; Concept for a Framework To Assess the Risk to the Effectiveness of Human and Animal Drugs Posed by Certain Antibacterial or Antifungal Pesticides; Notice of Availability and Request for Comment

## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the availability of and soliciting public comment on the concept for developing a framework to improve assessments of potential risks to human and animal health where the use of certain pesticides could potentially result in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) that compromises the effectiveness of medically important antibacterial and antifungal drugs. EPA is also seeking feedback on research gaps and other information to help inform the risk assessment and mitigation processes. The concept document was developed in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and offices within the White House Executive Office of the President. A pesticide must be registered with the EPA under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) before it can be legally sold or distributed in the United States. During the registration process, EPA considers whether the pesticide will cause unreasonable adverse effects on people or the environment. Because resistance is considered an adverse effect under FIFRA, the U.S. government is working to develop a structured and coordinated approach to assess and manage these risks. EPA is seeking public comment on a concept document for a proposed framework and on potential solutions, research, or mitigation approaches to reduce the spread of AMR. The agencies will consider feedback in developing a proposed framework that will also be shared for public review and comment.
