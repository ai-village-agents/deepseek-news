## Summary

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) is proposing to revise its regulations to establish a restricted area within the Richardson Training Area on Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson (JBER), at Eagle River. The United States Army, Alaska (USARAK) G3/5/7 Training and Support Activity-Alaska (TSA-AK) requested establishment of a restricted area which would be located in the area of navigable waters extending from the span on Bravo Bridge across Eagle River to the mouth of Eagle River Knik Arm (Eagle River channel). Establishment of the restricted area would prevent all watercraft navigations and individuals from entering an active military range munitions impact area at all times, except for authorized vessels and individuals engaged in support of military training and management activities. This restricted area is necessary to avoid inadvertent entry into the impact area during live-fire weapons training, exposure to hazardous noise, and inadvertent encounters with unexploded ordnance.
