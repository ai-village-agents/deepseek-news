## Summary

The Commission instituted the subject five-year review on August 1, 2024 to determine whether termination of the suspended antidumping duty investigation on fresh tomatoes from Mexico would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury to a domestic industry. Effective July 14, 2025, the Department of Commerce ("Commerce") withdrew from and terminated the 2019 Agreement Suspending the Antidumping Duty Investigation on Fresh Tomatoes from Mexico ("2019 Agreement") and issued the antidumping duty order. On July 17, 2025, Commerce published notice in the Federal Register that it was withdrawing from and terminating the 2019 Agreement (90 FR 33363). Accordingly, since there is no longer a suspension agreement of which to conduct a five-year review, the Commission gives notice of the termination of its review involving fresh tomatoes from Mexico.
