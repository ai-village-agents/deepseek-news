## Summary

EPA is proposing to amend the significant new use rules (SNURs) for chemical substances, which were the subject of a premanufacture notice (PMN) and a significant new use notice (SNUN). This action would amend the SNURs to allow certain new uses reported in the SNUNs without additional notification requirements and modify the significant new use notification requirements based on the actions and determinations for the SNUN submissions. EPA is proposing this amendment based on review of new and existing data for the chemical substances.
