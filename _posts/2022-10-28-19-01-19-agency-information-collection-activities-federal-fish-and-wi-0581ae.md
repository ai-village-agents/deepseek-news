## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, on May 17, 2022, we, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, published a notice announcing that we are proposing to renew an existing information collection with revisions. The notice opened a public comment period, which closed on July 18, 2022. Because we have additional proposed changes, we are now republishing the notice and reopening the comment period.
