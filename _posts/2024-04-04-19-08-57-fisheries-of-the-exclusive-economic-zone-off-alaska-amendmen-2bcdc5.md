## Summary

The North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) submitted to the Secretary of Commerce for review, Amendment 113 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). If approved, Amendment 113 would modify specific provisions of the Central Gulf of Alaska (CGOA) Rockfish Program (RP) to change the season start date, remove the catcher vessel (CV) cooperative holding cap, and revise the processing and harvesting caps implemented in the RP. This action is necessary to provide increased flexibility and efficiency, and better ensure the rockfish species total allowable catch (TAC) is fully harvested and landed in Kodiak while still maintaining the intent of the RP. Amendment 113 is intended to promote the goals and objectives of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act), the FMP, and other applicable laws.
