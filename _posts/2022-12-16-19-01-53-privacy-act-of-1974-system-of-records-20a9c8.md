## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the DoD is establishing a new Department-wide system of records titled, "Declared Public Health Emergency Exposure Records," DoD-0013. This system of records covers DoD's maintenance of records about individuals necessitated by a declared public health emergency (DPHE) by an appropriate official, including the Secretary of Health and Human Services pursuant to the Public Health Services Act, a DoD official, or other authorized state, local, or other governmental public health official pursuant to applicable law. These records are maintained to assist the DoD in establishing safe environments, identifying and protecting DoD-affiliated individuals at risk of transmission of or contracting the disease or agent at issue, and in supporting mission readiness. Additionally, the DoD is issuing a direct final rule, which is exempting this system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act, elsewhere in today's issue of the Federal Register.
