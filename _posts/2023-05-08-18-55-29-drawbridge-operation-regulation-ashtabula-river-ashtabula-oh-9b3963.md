## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to modify the operating schedule that governs the Fifth Street Bridge, mile 0.15, and the Norfolk Southern Railroad Bridge, mile 1.5, both over the Ashtabula River. The Coast Guard also proposes signaling and signage changes for the Norfolk Southern Railroad Bridge, mile 1.5. The Coast Guard is modifying these rules in response to complaints received concerning the operations of one or more bridges in this waterway and a desire to improve safety, remove barriers to interstate commerce, improve communications, and standardize winter operations associated with these bridges. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
