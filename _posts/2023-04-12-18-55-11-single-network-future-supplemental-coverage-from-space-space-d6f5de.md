# Single Network Future: Supplemental Coverage From Space; Space Innovation

## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would facilitate the integration of satellite and terrestrial networks by proposing a new regulatory framework for Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS). Through this novel approach, satellite operators collaborating with terrestrial service providers would be able to obtain Commission authorization to operate space stations on currently licensed, flexible-use spectrum allocated to terrestrial services. This would enable expanded coverage to a terrestrial licensee's subscribers, especially in remote, unserved, and underserved areas, and would increase the availability of emergency communications.
