## Summary

The Department of Labor (Department or DOL) is correcting a direct final rule that appeared in the Federal Register on January 11, 2021, "Rules of Practice and Procedure Concerning Filing and Service and Amended Rules Concerning Filing and Service." The companion proposed rule to the final rule was published in the same issue of the Federal Register. The final rule required electronic filing (e-filing) and made acceptance of electronic service (e-service) automatic for attorneys and non-attorney representatives representing parties in proceedings before the Administrative Review Board, unless the Board authorized non-electronic filing and service for good cause. Among other changes, the final rule was intended to revise several sections of the Code of Federal Regulations. However, the final rule as published inadvertently omitted amendatory instructions to revise two section headings, despite providing revised language for those headings. This document provides the omitted amendatory instructions to ensure that these two section headings are revised as written in the final rule.
