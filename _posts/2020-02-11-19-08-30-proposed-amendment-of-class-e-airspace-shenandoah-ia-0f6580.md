## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Shenandoah Municipal Airport, Shenandoah, IA. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of an airspace review caused by the decommissioning of the Shenandoah non- directional radio beacon (NDB), which provided navigation information for the instrument procedures at this airport. Airspace redesign is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at this airport.
