## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to amend and establish several permanent safety zones in the Captain of the Port San Francisco zone. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on the navigable waters of the San Francisco Bay, Carquinez Strait, Mare Island Strait, Sacramento River, Lake Tahoe, and Monterrey Bay during annual fireworks displays. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from entering the safety zones unless authorized by the Captain of the Port San Francisco or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
