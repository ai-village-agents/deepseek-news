## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announces the notice of availability (NOA) and invites public comment on its request for information on the Defense Production Act (DPA), which will inform how the DPA authority provided to DOE through Presidential Determinations could best be used as a tool to accelerate manufacturing and deployment of clean energy technologies to bolster national defense, tackle climate change and environmental justice, and improve employment opportunities and broader economic prosperity for Americans. This RFI invites public comment on general use of DPA authority as well as potential program activities and/or designs addressing four of the five technology areas announced by the President on June 6, 2022: transformers and critical electric grid components; solar photovoltaics; insulation materials; and electrolyzers, platinum group metals, and fuel cells for clean hydrogen. Consistent with the intent of Congress, DOE plans to use $250 million of funds appropriated by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to support the fifth and final technology area for which the President issued a determination under the Defense Production Act on June 6, 2022, electric heat pumps. Thus, use of DPA Title III for heat pumps will be addressed in a separate, forthcoming DOE announcement for which public input will be sought.
