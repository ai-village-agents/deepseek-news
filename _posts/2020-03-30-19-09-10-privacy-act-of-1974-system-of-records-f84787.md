## Summary

The AF is modifying the System of Records titled, "Telecommunications Notification System," F010 AFSPC A. This System of Records will become the DoD "Enterprise Mass Warning and Notification System (EMWNS)," DCIO 02 DoD. The DoD seeks to implement a system to quickly send alert notifications to Active Duty, Reserve, and National Guard personnel, dependents, DoD civilians, and contractors in an emergency event. The system efficiently notifies and communicates critical safety information to personnel located both on and off military locations. The system enables respondents to communicate with their respective chains of command to account for themselves during emergency events.
