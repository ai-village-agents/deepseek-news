## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bell Textron Inc. Model 212, 412, 412CF, and 412EP helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of a cracked check valve. This AD requires inspecting certain engine oil and fuel check valves, and depending on the results, repetitively inspecting and removing the check valve from service. This AD also prohibits installing affected engine oil and fuel check valves on any helicopter. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
