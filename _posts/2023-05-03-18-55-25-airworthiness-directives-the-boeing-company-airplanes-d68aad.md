## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-02-16, which applies to all The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. AD 2022-02-16 requires revising the limitations and operating procedures sections of the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to incorporate limitations prohibiting certain landings and the use of certain minimum equipment list (MEL) items, and to incorporate operating procedures for calculating landing distances, when in the presence of 5G C-Band interference as identified by Notices to Air Missions (NOTAMs). Since the FAA issued AD 2022-02-16, the FAA determined that additional limitations are needed due to the continued deployment of new 5G C-Band base stations whose signals are expected to cover most of the contiguous United States at transmission frequencies between 3.7-3.98 GHz. This proposed AD would require revising the limitations section of the existing AFM to incorporate limitations prohibiting certain landings and the use of certain MEL items, and would retain the operating procedures from AD 2022-02-16 for calculating landing distances, due to the presence of 5G C-Band interference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
