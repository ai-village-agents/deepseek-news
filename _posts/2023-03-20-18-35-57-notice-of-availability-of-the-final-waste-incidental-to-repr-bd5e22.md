## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announces the availability of the Final Waste Incidental to Reprocessing Evaluation for the Test Bed Initiative Demonstration, U.S. Department of Energy (Final WIR Evaluation) and associated Waste Incidental to Reprocessing Determination for the Test Bed Initiative Demonstration at the Hanford Site, Washington (WIR Determination). The Final WIR Evaluation demonstrates that the waste from DOE's proposed Test Bed Initiative (TBI) Demonstration is waste incidental to reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, is not high-level radioactive waste (HLW), and may be managed as low-level radioactive waste (LLW). DOE prepared the Final WIR Evaluation pursuant to DOE Order 435.1, Radioactive Waste Management, and the criteria in Chapter II.B.(2)(a) of DOE Manual 435.1-1, Radioactive Waste Management Manual. DOE consulted with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) on the Draft Waste Incidental to Reprocessing Evaluation for the Test Bed Initiative Demonstration (Draft WIR Evaluation) and made the Draft WIR Evaluation available for comments from States, Tribal Nations, stakeholders and the public. DOE prepared the Final WIR Evaluation after carefully considering comments received from the NRC, States, Tribal Nations, stakeholders and the public, and after performing revisions of analyses and technical documents. Based on the Final WIR Evaluation, DOE determined that the pretreated and solidified waste is incidental to reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, is non-HLW, and is to be managed as LLW.
