## Summary

The Rules of Practice for Adjudication Proceedings (Rules of Practice) govern adjudication proceedings conducted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The CFPB issued a proposal to rescind amendments it adopted to the Rules of Practice on February 22, 2022, and March 29, 2023 (2022 and 2023 amendments). The 2022 and 2023 amendments that the Bureau proposed to rescind included a new deposition process, amendments concerning timing and deadlines, bifurcation of proceedings, the process for deciding dispositive motions, and requirements for issue exhaustion, as well as other technical changes. After considering the comments on the proposal, the CFPB has decided to rescind the amendments as proposed, except as related to narrow clarificatory and procedural changes.
