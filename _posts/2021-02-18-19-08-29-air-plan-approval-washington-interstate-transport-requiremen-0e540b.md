## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted by Washington on February 7, 2018 as meeting certain Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements for interstate transport of the 2010 1-hour Sulfur Dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The EPA has determined that emissions from Washington sources will not contribute significantly to nonattainment or interfere with the maintenance of the 2010 1-hour SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS in any other state.
