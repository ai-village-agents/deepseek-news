## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Yabor[atilde] Ind[uacute]stria Aeron[aacute]utica S.A. Model EMB-135 and EMB-145 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report involving disconnection of a side arm strut from the right main landing gear (MLG); a subsequent investigation found that the side arm strut lower bearing was installed inverted on the airplane. This AD requires doing a general visual inspection of the right and left MLG to verify certain conditions and doing all applicable on-condition actions, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
