## Summary

The Department of Commerce (Commerce) has completed the administrative review of the antidumping duty order on uncovered innerspring units (innersprings) from the People's Republic of China (China) covering the period of review (POR) February 1, 2018 through January 31, 2019. We continue to find that none of the exporters of subject merchandise demonstrated eligibility for a separate rate; therefore, each is part of the China-wide entity.
