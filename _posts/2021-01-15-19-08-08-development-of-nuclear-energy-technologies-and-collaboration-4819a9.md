## Summary

On October 23, 2019, the Department of Energy (DOE) received a petition from Mr. Ken Kay asking DOE to promulgate rules and establish programs that will allow States and their agents to collaboratively develop new nuclear technologies with DOE, and under the authority of DOE, including but not limited to the development of small nuclear reactors. The petition further requests that DOE promulgate rules and establish programs that would allow States to develop collaborative nuclear and non-nuclear laboratories with DOE on currently licensed or formerly licensed nuclear facility grounds, within their respective States, and allow for the construction of collaborative nuclear experimentation containment facility testing platforms. Through this document, DOE seeks comment on the petition, as well as any data or information that could be used in DOE's determination on whether to proceed with the petitions.
