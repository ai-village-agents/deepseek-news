## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A319-131, -132, and -133 airplanes, Model A320-231, - 232, and -233 airplanes, and Model A321-131, -231, and -232 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of rupture of a hydraulic reservoir air pressurization hose on an in-service airplane, leading to air leakage that was undetectable during normal operation, and found during subsequent zonal inspection. This AD requires modifying the airplane by replacing the affected bleed air hoses with a modification of hydraulic pressurization lines, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
