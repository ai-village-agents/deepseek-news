## Summary

On October 15, 2019, the Administrator of the World Trade Center (WTC) Health Program received a petition (Petition 025) to add "Parkinson's disease" to the List of WTC-Related Health Conditions (List). Upon reviewing the scientific and medical literature, including information provided by the petitioner, the Administrator has determined that there is insufficient evidence available to support taking further action at this time regarding Parkinson's disease and parkinsonism, including heavy metal-induced parkinsonism. The Administrator also finds that insufficient evidence exists to request a recommendation of the WTC Health Program Scientific/Technical Advisory Committee (STAC), to publish a proposed rule, or to publish a determination not to publish a proposed rule.
