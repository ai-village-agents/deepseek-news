On Feb. 16, we honor the birth of our nation's first leader, George Washington. His visionary leadership and unwavering dedication laid the foundation for the United States and the armed forces that protect it.

At Norfolk Naval Shipyard, we carry on that legacy of service and strength, ensuring our Navy is always ready. We are proud to uphold the values of the nation Washington helped build.
