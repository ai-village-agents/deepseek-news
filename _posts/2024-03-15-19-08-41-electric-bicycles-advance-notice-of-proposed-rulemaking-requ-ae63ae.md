The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) is considering developing a rule to address the risk of injury associated with electric bicycles (e-bikes). This advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) initiates a rulemaking proceeding under the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA) and the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA). We invite comments concerning the risk of injury associated with mechanical hazards of e-bikes, potential regulatory alternatives, the economic impacts of various approaches, existing voluntary standards, and plans to develop new standards to address these risks.
