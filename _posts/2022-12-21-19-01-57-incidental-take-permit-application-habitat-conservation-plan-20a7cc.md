## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, announce the availability of documents related to an application for an incidental take permit (permit) under the Endangered Species Act. The St. Charles Town Company has applied for a permit, which, if granted, would authorize take of the federally threatened Preble's meadow jumping mouse (Zapus hudsonius preblei) that is likely to occur incidental to proposed construction of commercial and industrial building space known as Brookside Business Center. The documents available for review and comment are the applicant's habitat conservation plan, which is part of the permit application, and our draft environmental action statement and low-effect screening form, which support a categorical exclusion under the National Environmental Policy Act. We invite comments from the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies.
