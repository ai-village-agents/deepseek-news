## Summary

The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) will hold three public hearings on the proposed rule, Lowering Miners' Exposure to Respirable Crystalline Silica and Improving Respiratory Protection. The proposed rule was published on July 13, 2023 and is available at https://www.regulations.gov and MSHA's website at www.MSHA.gov. The proposed rule would amend MSHA's existing standards to better protect miners against occupational exposure to respirable crystalline silica, a carcinogenic hazard, and to improve respiratory protection for all airborne hazards.
