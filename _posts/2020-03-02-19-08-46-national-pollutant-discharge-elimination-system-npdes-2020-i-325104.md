## Summary

All ten of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Regions are proposing for public comment the 2020 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) general permit for stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, also referred to as the "2020 Multi-Sector General Permit (MSGP)" or the "proposed permit." The proposed permit, once finalized, will replace the EPA's existing MSGP that will expire on June 4, 2020. The EPA proposes to issue this permit for five (5) years, and to provide permit coverage to eligible operators in all areas of the country where the EPA is the NPDES permitting authority, including Idaho, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and New Mexico, Indian country lands, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and most U.S. territories and protectorates. The EPA seeks comment on the proposed permit and on the accompanying fact sheet, which contains supporting documentation. This Federal Register document describes the proposed permit and includes specific topics on which the EPA is particularly seeking comment. Where the EPA proposes a new or modified provision, the Agency also solicits comment on alternatives to the proposal and/or not moving forward with the proposal in the final permit. The EPA encourages the public to read the fact sheet to better understand the proposed permit. The proposed permit and fact sheet can be found at https://www.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater-discharges-industrial- activities.
