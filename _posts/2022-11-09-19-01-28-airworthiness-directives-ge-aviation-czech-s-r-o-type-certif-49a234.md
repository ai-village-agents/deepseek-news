# Airworthiness Directives; GE Aviation Czech s.r.o. (Type Certificate Previously Held by WALTER Engines a.s., Walter a.s., and MOTORLET a.s.) Turboprop Engines

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain GE Aviation Czech s.r.o. (GEAC) M601E-11, M601E-11A, M601E- 11AS, M601E-11S, and M601F model turboprop engines. This proposed AD was prompted by the exclusion of life limits for certain compressor cases and compressor drums from the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the engine maintenance manual (EMM). This proposed AD was also prompted by certain compressor cases that, following rework, were improperly re-identified and the engine logbook entries were not completed. This proposed AD would require recalculation of the consumed life for the affected compressor cases and compressor drums and, depending on the results of the recalculation, removal and replacement of the affected compressor case or compressor drum with a part eligible for installation. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
