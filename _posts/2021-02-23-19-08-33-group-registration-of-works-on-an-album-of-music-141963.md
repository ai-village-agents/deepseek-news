## Summary

The U.S. Copyright Office is creating a new group registration option for musical works, sound recordings, and certain other works contained on an album. This option will permit the registration of a group of musical works or a group of sound recordings distributed together, regardless of whether such distribution occurs via physical or digital media. The final rule generally adopts the provisions set forth in the May 2019 notice of proposed rulemaking in this proceeding, with certain updates to reflect the planned implementation of new online applications for this option.
