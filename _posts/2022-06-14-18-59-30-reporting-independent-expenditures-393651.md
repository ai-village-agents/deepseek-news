# Reporting Independent Expenditures

**Published:** February 05, 2026 18:59 UTC

**Document Number:** 2022-12771

## Summary

The Federal Election Commission is removing a regulation requiring that certain persons making independent expenditures disclose on their reports the identification of each person who made a contribution over $200 to the persons filing such reports "for the purpose of furthering the reported independent expenditure." The Commission is taking this action to comply with the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which affirmed a district court decision holding that the disclosure regulation was invalid. The Commission is accepting comments on this revision to its regulation and any comments received may be addressed in a subsequent rulemaking document. Further information is provided in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION that follows.
