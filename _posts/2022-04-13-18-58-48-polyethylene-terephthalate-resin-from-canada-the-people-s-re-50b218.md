## Summary

As a result of the determinations by the Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) orders on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) resin from Canada, the People's Republic of China (China), India, and the Sultanate of Oman (Oman) would likely lead to a continuation or recurrence of dumping and material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation of these AD orders.
