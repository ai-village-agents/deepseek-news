## Summary

This action amends the Class D airspace at Joe Williams NOLF, Meridian, MS; Key Field, Meridian, MS; and NAS Meridian/McCain Field, Meridian, MS; the Class E airspace area designated as an extension to Class D airspace at Key Field; and the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Key Field, Joe Williams NOLF, and NAS Meridian/McCain Field. This action is due to an airspace review caused by the decommissioning of the Kewanee VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) navigation aid, which provided navigation information for the instrument procedures at these airports, as part of the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program. The names and geographic coordinates of NAS Meridian/McCain Field and Joe Williams NOLF, and the geographic coordinates of Key Field are also being updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database. Airspace redesign is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at these airports.
