## Summary

The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) announces the opportunity to apply for funding for transit bus automation demonstration projects under the Public Transportation Innovation Program. FTA is exploring the use of driving automation technologies in bus transit operations as described in the Strategic Transit Automation Research (STAR) Plan. As part of this research agenda, FTA is funding a number of demonstrations in real-world settings. These projects will create a testbed for study of technical issues, user acceptance, operational and maintenance costs, workforce training and transition, and institutional issues, and will further assess the needs for standards development.
