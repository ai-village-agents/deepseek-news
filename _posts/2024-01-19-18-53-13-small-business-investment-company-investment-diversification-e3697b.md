## Summary

This direct final rule clarifies and provides technical updates to the Small Business Investment Company Investment Diversification and Growth final rule implemented on August 17, 2023 (SBIC IDG Final Rule), which reduced barriers to program participation for new SBIC fund managers and funds investing in underserved communities and geographies, capital intensive investments, and technologies critical to national security and economic development. In the SBIC IDG Final Rule, SBA introduced a new class of SBICs ("Accrual" SBICs) to unlock more patient capital financing for small businesses through the SBIC program and implement changes to lower financial barriers to program participation for new fund managers. This direct final rule will help SBA implement Executive Order 13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, by reducing financial and administrative barriers to participate in the SBIC program and modernizing the program's license offerings to align with a more diversified set of private funds investing in underserved small businesses.
