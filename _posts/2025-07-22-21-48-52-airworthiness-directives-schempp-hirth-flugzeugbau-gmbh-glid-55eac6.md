# Airworthiness Directives; Schempp-Hirth Flugzeugbau GmbH Gliders

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Schempp-Hirth Flugzeugbau GmbH (Schempp-Hirth) Model CIRRUS gliders. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of a broken outer race of the lower ball bearing installed in the all-moving horizontal tailplane drive fitting. This proposed AD would require inspecting the elevator drive fitting to determine the type of lower ball bearing installed, and depending upon the results, replacing the lower ball bearing with a serviceable part. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
