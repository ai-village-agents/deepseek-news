## Summary

This action delays the effective date of a final rule published in the Federal Register on December 9, 2024, amending Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal Airways V-68, V-212, and V-222, and United States Area Navigation (RNAV) Route T-220; and revoking VOR Federal Airway V-558. The FAA is delaying the effective date to allow sufficient time for completing the update and flight inspection of a Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR) instrument procedure into George Bush Intercontinental/Houston Airport, TX, that failed the initial flight inspection and a STAR instrument procedure into San Antonio International Airport, TX, that also failed the initial flight inspection. The STARs are being amended in support of the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Industry, TX (IDU), VOR/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC).
