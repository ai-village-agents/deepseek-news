## Summary

This action proposes to amend VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-198, V-212, V-556, and V-558; amend Area Navigation (RNAV) route T-256; and establish RNAV route T-466. The FAA is proposing this action due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Eagle Lake, TX (ELA), VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) navigational aid (NAVAID). The Eagle Lake VOR is being decommissioned in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
