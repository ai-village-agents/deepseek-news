## Summary

On September 5, 2000, in response to a petition filed under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), EPA issued a proposed rule to add a diisononyl phthalate (DINP) category to the list of toxic chemicals subject to the reporting requirements under EPCRA and the Pollution Prevention Act (PPA). EPA proposed to add this chemical category to the EPCRA toxic chemical list based on its preliminary conclusion that this category met the EPCRA toxicity criterion. EPA has updated its hazard assessment for DINP and is proposing to add DINP as a category defined to include branched alkyl di-esters of 1,2 benzenedicarboxylic acid in which alkyl ester moieties contain a total of nine carbons. The updated hazard assessment demonstrates that the proposed DINP category meets the EPCRA toxicity criterion because the members of the category can reasonably be anticipated to cause cancer and serious or irreversible chronic health effects in humans; specifically, developmental, kidney, and liver toxicity. EPA is proposing to add the DINP category to the toxic chemical list on this basis and is requesting comment on the updated DINP hazard assessment and associated updated economic analysis.
