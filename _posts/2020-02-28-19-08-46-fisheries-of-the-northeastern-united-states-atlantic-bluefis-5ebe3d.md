## Summary

This temporary rule implements interim recreational management measures for the 2020 Atlantic Bluefish Fishery to prevent overfishing. This action is necessary to constrain recreational harvest at the start of the fishing year while final 2020 measures are developed and implemented. These measures are expected to help ensure the long-term recovery and sustainability of the bluefish stock.
