## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FMCSA announces its plan to submit the information collection request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review and approval and invites public comment. FMCSA requests approval to renew the ICR titled "Safe Driver Apprenticeship Pilot Program." This ICR was previously approved under emergency procedures on January 24, 2022 and expires on July 31, 2022. The ICR is necessary for FMCSA to conduct a pilot program to determine the safety impacts of allowing 18- to 20-year-old commercial driver's license (CDL) holders to operate commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) in interstate commerce. The ICR will cover data collected on drivers and carriers participating in the pilot program.
