## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is granting exemptions from certain portions of the acceptance criteria for emergency core cooling, and the general design criteria for emergency core cooling, containment heat removal, and atmosphere cleanup to allow the use of a risk-informed analysis to evaluate the effects of debris in containment following a loss-of-coolant accident for the Callaway Plant, Unit No. 1 (Callaway) located in Callaway County, Missouri. The exemptions are in response to a request dated March 31, 2021, from Union Electric Company, doing business as Ameren Missouri (the licensee) related to the licensee's proposed approach to resolve a generic safety concern for pressurized water reactors associated with potential clogging of emergency core cooling and containment spray system strainers during certain design basis events.
