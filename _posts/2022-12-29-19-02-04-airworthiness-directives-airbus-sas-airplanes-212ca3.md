## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This AD is prompted by a report that during flight and fatigue testing it was detected that some fasteners installed in the center wing box (CWB) rotated inside their fastener holes. This AD requires replacing affected fasteners and applying additional head nut cap protection at the front and rear spars in the CWB, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
