## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is publishing a final rule to update the incorporation by reference of several voluntary consensus standards in the Agency's formaldehyde standards for composite wood products regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) that have since been updated, superseded, or withdrawn by the issuing organizations. In addition, EPA is taking final action to reflect its interpretation that remote inspections by third-party certifiers (TPCs) are allowed in certain circumstances in the event of unsafe conditions such as the on-going COVID-19 pandemic or other unsafe conditions such as natural disasters, outbreaks, political unrest, and epidemics. Finally, EPA is making certain technical corrections and conforming changes including updating standards within the definitions section, clarifying language as it relates to production, and creating greater flexibilities for the third-party certification process.
