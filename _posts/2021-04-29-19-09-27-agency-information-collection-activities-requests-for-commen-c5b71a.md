## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for a new information collection. The collection is from persons or entities that desire to provide Inspection Authorization (IA) refresher courses for the purpose of IA renewal. The course providers complete FAA Form 8610-6 to substantiate their courses and administrative procedures are acceptable to the Administrator as required by 14 CFR 65.93(a)(4).
