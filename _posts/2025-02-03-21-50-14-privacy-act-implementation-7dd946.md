## Summary

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS or Department) published a direct final rule in the Federal Register on December 23, 2024, which was to become effective February 6, 2025. As a result of administrative technical issues, including an incorrect email address, HHS is reopening the public comment period with a new email address for the public to submit comments and delaying the effective date to March 21, 2025. The purpose of the direct final rule was to exempt a new Privacy Act system of records maintained by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), Unaccompanied Children Bureau (UCB), System No. 09- 80-0323, "ORR Unaccompanied Children Bureau (UCB) Child Abuse or Neglect Investigation Records and Central Registry," from certain requirements of the Privacy Act, in accordance with subsection (k)(2) of the Privacy Act.
