## Summary

These special conditions are issued for the Leonardo S.p.A. (Leonardo) Model A119 and AW119 MKII helicopters. These helicopters as modified by AgustaWestland Philadelphia Corporation (AWPC) will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for helicopters. This design feature is the optional closed circuit refueling receiver (CCRR). The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
