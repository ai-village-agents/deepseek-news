## Summary

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) establishes the 50-square mile "Rocky Reach" viticultural area in portions of Chelan and Douglas Counties, in Washington. The newly-established Rocky Reach viticultural area is located entirely within the existing Columbia Valley viticultural area. TTB designates viticultural areas to allow vintners to better describe the origin of their wines and to allow consumers to better identify wines they may purchase.
