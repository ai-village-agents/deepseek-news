## Summary

Under the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, the Department of the Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO), is issuing a public notice of its intent to create a new system of records, Voice of the Customer (VoC). HUD has developed VoC system of records to satisfy the Executive Order 14058, on Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild Trust in Government, issued on December 13, 2021. The VoC platform provides customers with the ability to share their likes and dislikes about HUD's products or services. Customers feedback lets HUD focus on improving areas that would result in customer satisfaction and improve trust in the Federal Government.
