## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Morganton, NC, by expanding the airspace to encompass Carolinas Healthcare System Blue Ridge, Morganton, NC. It would also update the name of the former Morganton- Lenoir Airport to Foothills Regional Airport, Morganton, NC, as the airport has changed its name. Finally, it would remove the Grace Hospital reference along with the point in space coordinates, as Grace Hospital no longer exists. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at this airport.
