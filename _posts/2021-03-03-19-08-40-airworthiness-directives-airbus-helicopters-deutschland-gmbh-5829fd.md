## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (AHD) Model MBB-BK 117 D-2 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a broken Titanium (Ti) bolt. This proposed AD would require removing certain Ti- bolts from service and prohibit installing these Ti-bolts in a critical area. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
