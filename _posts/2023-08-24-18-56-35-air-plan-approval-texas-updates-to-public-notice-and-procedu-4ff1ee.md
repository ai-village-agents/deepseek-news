## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving portions of three revisions to the Texas State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) on July 9, 2021, and January 21, 2022, that update the air permitting program by removing obsolete provisions and enhancing public notice requirements of the air permitting program. We are also making ministerial edits to correct several errors identified in the amendatory language for the Texas SIP.
