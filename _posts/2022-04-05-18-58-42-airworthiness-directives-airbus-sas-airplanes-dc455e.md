## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-09- 09, which applied to certain Airbus Model A318 and A319 series airplanes; all Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and all Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2018-09-09 required modifying the holes of the upper cleat to upper stringer attachments at certain areas of the left- and right-hand wings. Since the FAA issued AD 2018-09-09, additional affected configurations were identified and, for certain airplanes, it was determined that additional modification work and revised compliance times are necessary. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2018-09-09 and adds airplanes, requires different compliance times for certain airplane configurations, and, for certain airplanes, requires additional modifications or reduces compliance times, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
