## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Helicopters (Airbus) Model AS332C, AS332C1, AS332L, AS332L1, AS332L2, and EC225LP helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by modifications developed by Airbus to address a report of an emergency exit window that required excessive pushing force to jettison. This proposed AD would require removing skived polytetrafluoroethylene tape (PTFE tape) (if installed) and replacing certain polychloroprene seals with silicone seals, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). This proposed AD would also prohibit installing a jettisonable window unless the actions required by this AD have been accomplished. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
