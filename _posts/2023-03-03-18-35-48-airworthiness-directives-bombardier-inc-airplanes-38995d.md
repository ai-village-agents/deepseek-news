## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-2A12 airplanes. This AD was prompted by report that the passenger door functional test engineering requirements (FTERs) were not fully accomplished on several airplanes. This AD requires measuring the passenger door steps, passenger door gaps, and passenger door stops rigging, and re-adjusting the door if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
