## Summary

This order extends the duration of the withdrawal created by Public Land Order (PLO) No. 7513, which would otherwise expire on February 20, 2022, for an additional 20-year period. PLO No. 7513 withdrew 20.90 acres of National Forest System land from location and entry under the United States mining laws, but not from the general land laws or mineral leasing laws. The withdrawal extension is necessary to continue protection of the Tie Hack Campground in Johnson County, Wyoming, which would otherwise expire on February 20, 2022.
