## Summary

The Forest Service is revising the Nez Perce and Clearwater National Forests' 1987 Land and Resource Management Plans. The Forest Service has prepared a final environmental impact statement (EIS) for the revised land management plan and a draft record of decision (ROD). This notice is to inform the public that the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forests are initiating a 60-day period where individuals or entities with specific concerns about the revised land management plan and the associated final EIS may file objections for Forest Service review prior to the approval of the revised land management plan. This is also an opportunity to object to the Regional Forester's list of species of conservation concern on the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forests.
