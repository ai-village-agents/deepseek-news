## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), have received three applications for incidental take permits (ITPs) for the federally threatened Morro shoulderband snail under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. Each of three applicants submitted a permit application which, if issued, would authorize take of the Morro shoulderband snail incidental to activities associated with development of a single-family residence in Los Osos, San Luis Obispo County, California. As part of the application for an ITP, each applicant submitted a draft habitat conservation plan for their respective project. For each proect, The Service prepared a draft low-effect screening form and environmental action statement in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act to evaluate the potential effects to the natural and human environment resulting from issuing an ITP to each applicant for their project. We invite the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies to comment on these documents.
