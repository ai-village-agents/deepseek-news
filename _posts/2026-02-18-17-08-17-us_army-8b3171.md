Since the establishment of Joint Interagency Task Force 401 by Secretary of War Pete Hegseth last August, U.S. Army Yuma Test Center has been designated as the primary, dedicated interagency C-sUAS test and training range. The designation means specifically that YPG will primarily focus on Class I and II small UAS, while larger Class III through V systems will continue to primarily be tested at White Sands Missile Range, YPG’s larger sister installation.
