## Summary

The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) is making available, on its website and in the docket, final initial updates to the Capital Investment Grants (CIG) program policy guidance. These revisions amend FTA's CIG Final Interim Policy Guidance last published in June 2016 to reflect changes made to the program by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), also known as the "Bipartisan Infrastructure Law". In March 2022, FTA published initial guidance proposals for implementing changes made to the CIG program by the IIJA for public comment. FTA appreciates the thoughtful comments received and has incorporated some of the suggestions into the initial updated CIG program policy guidance. FTA is placing formal responses to the comments received in the docket. This policy guidance continues to complement FTA's regulations that govern the CIG program.
