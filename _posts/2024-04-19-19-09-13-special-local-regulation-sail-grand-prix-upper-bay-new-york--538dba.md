## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary special local regulation in the Upper Bay of New York Harbor in support of Sail Grand Prix 2024 from June 21, 2024, through June 23, 2024. This special local regulation is necessary to provide for the safety of life from the dangers associated with high-speed sailing during the event. This proposed rulemaking would temporarily prohibit persons and vessels from entering, transiting through, blocking, or loitering within the event area, unless authorized by the Captain of the Port New York or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
