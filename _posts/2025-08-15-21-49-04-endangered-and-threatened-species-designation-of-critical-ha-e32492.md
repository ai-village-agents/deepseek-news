# Endangered and Threatened Species; Designation of Critical Habitat for Five Species of Threatened Indo-Pacific Corals; Correction

## Summary

NMFS is correcting a final rule that appeared in the Federal Register of July 15, 2025. The document designated critical habitat for five species of Indo-Pacific corals that are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). As part of the final rule, NMFS added a section describing the critical habitat areas being designated and amended a table to cross-reference the newly added section for each of the five species. In amending the table, NMFS inadvertently used the incorrect section number as the cross-reference. This document corrects those errors.
