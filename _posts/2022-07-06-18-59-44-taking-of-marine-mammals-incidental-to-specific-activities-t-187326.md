## Summary

NMFS has received a request from the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities (AKDOT&PF) for the re-issuance of a previously issued incidental harassment authorization (IHA) with the only change being effective dates. The initial IHA authorized take of eight species of marine mammals, by Level B harassment only, incidental to pile driving and removal activities and down-the-hole (DTH) drilling activities associated with maintenance improvements to the existing Metlakatla Seaplane Facility (MSF), Metlakatla, Alaska. The project has been delayed and none of the work covered in the initial IHA has been conducted. The initial IHA was effective from August 1, 2021 through July 31, 2022. The AKDOT&PF has requested re-issuance with new effective dates of July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2023. The scope of the activities and anticipated effects remain the same, authorized take numbers are not changed, and the required mitigation, monitoring, and reporting remains the same as included in the initial IHA. NMFS is, therefore, issuing a second identical IHA to cover the incidental take analyzed and authorized in the initial IHA.
