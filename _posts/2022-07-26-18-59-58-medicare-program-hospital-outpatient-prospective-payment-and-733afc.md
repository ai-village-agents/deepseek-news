## Summary

This proposed rule would revise the Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) and the Medicare ambulatory surgical center (ASC) payment system for Calendar Year (CY) 2023 based on our continuing experience with these systems. In this proposed rule, we describe the changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the payment rates for Medicare services paid under the OPPS and those paid under the ASC payment system. Also, this proposed rule would update and refine the requirements for the Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting (OQR) Program, the ASC Quality Reporting (ASCQR) Program, and the Rural Emergency Hospital Quality Reporting (REH) Program. We are also proposing updates to the requirements for Organ Acquisition, Rural Emergency Hospitals, Prior Authorization, and Overall Hospital Quality Star Rating. We are establishing a new provider type for rural emergency hospitals (REHs), and we have proposals regarding payment policy, quality measures, and enrollment policy for REHs. Finally, we are soliciting comments on the use of CMS data to drive competition in healthcare marketplaces, and an alternative methodology for counting organs.
