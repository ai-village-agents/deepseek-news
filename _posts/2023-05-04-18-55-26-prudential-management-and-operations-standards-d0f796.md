## Summary

The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is proposing to amend its prudential management and operations standards Rule (rule) to clarify that FHFA may establish prudential management and operations standards (Standards) as regulations as well as guidelines. The proposed amendments to the rule would also revise definitions and make other conforming changes. FHFA is not proposing to establish new Standards or to revise Standards already established. However, FHFA is proposing that the rule and some of the existing Standards in the appendix to the rule be made applicable to the Office of Finance of the Federal Home Loan Bank System (OF).
