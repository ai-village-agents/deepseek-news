## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing a limited approval and limited disapproval of revisions to the Eastern Kern Air Pollution Control District (EKAPCD or "District") portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). This revision concerns emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) from Portland cement kilns. We are proposing a limited approval of a local rule to regulate these emissions sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA) because the rule would strengthen the current SIP-approved version of the EKAPCD's Portland cement kiln rule. We are proposing a limited disapproval of this revision due to the presence of exemptions for periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (breakdown), which are inconsistent with CAA requirements. We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
