## Summary

This document contains proposed regulations concerning recordkeeping and reporting requirements for the average income test for purposes of the low-income housing credit. If a building is part of a residential rental project that satisfies this test, the building may be eligible to earn low-income housing credits. These proposed regulations affect owners of low-income housing projects and State or local housing credit agencies that monitor compliance with the requirements for low-income housing credits. In the Rules and Regulations section of this issue of the Federal Register, the IRS is issuing temporary regulations concerning the recordkeeping and reporting requirements for the average income test. The text of the temporary regulations also serves as the text of these proposed regulations.
