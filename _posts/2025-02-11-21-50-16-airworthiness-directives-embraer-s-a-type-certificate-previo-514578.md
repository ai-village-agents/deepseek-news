## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Embraer S.A. Model EMB-120, -120ER, -120FC, -120QC, and -120RT airplanes. This AD was prompted by a structural assessment, which found that the fuselage longitudinal skin splice and panel between certain frames are susceptible to cracking. This AD requires performing repetitive inspections of the fuselage center I longitudinal skin splice and applicable corrective actions, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is incorporated by reference (IBR). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
