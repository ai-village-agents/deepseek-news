## Summary

In accordance with our regulations, NHTSA is granting 13 petitions for renewal of temporary exemptions from the requirement to install Type 2 seat belts (i.e., shoulder belts) at side-facing seats on motorcoaches. The 13 petitioners are final-stage manufacturers of entertainer-type motorcoaches, seeking temporary exemptions from the shoulder belt requirement of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 208, "Occupant crash protection," for side-facing seats. The granted exemptions permit the petitioners to continue to install Type 1 seat belts (lap belt only) at side-facing seating positions, instead of Type 2 seat belts (lap and shoulder belts) required by FMVSS No. 208. After reviewing the petitions and the comments received, the agency has determined that the requested exemption renewals are warranted to enable each petitioner to sell vehicles whose overall level of safety or impact protection is at least equal to that of a nonexempted vehicle.
