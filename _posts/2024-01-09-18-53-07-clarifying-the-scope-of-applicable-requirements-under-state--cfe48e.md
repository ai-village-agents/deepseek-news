## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to update its title V operating permit program regulations to more clearly reflect the EPA's existing interpretations and policies concerning when and whether "applicable requirements" established in other Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act) programs should be reviewed, modified, and/or implemented through the title V operating permits program. Specifically, this action clarifies the limited situations in which requirements under the New Source Review (NSR) preconstruction permitting program would be reviewed using the EPA's unique title V oversight authorities. Additionally, this action clarifies that requirements related to an owner or operator's general duty to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances are not "applicable requirements" for title V purposes and are not implemented through title V.
