**Document Number:** 2025-04008

## Summary

In the document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) seeks comment on a proposed voluntary, negotiation-based process to transition the entire ten megahertz in the 900 MHz band for broadband use in counties where applicants and licensees reach private agreements to do so. In order to implement this proposed framework, the Commission seeks comment on whether the current 900 MHz broadband rules, such as the eligibility criteria, application requirements and procedures, licensing and operating rules, and technical requirements, are the appropriate vehicles for effectuating a ten megahertz broadband licensing framework. Additionally, pursuant to the Order, the Commission delegates to the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau of the Commission the authority to modify or terminate the current freeze on certain applications in the 900 MHz band.
