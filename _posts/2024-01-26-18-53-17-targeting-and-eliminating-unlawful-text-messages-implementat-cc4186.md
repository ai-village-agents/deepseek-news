## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) requires terminating mobile wireless providers to block text messages from a particular number following notification from the Commission. The Commission also codifies that the National Do-Not-Call (DNC) Registry's protections extend to text messages. In addition, the Commission encourages mobile wireless providers to make email-to-text, a major source of illegal texts, a service that consumers proactively opt into. The Commission closes the lead generator loophole by requiring comparison shopping websites to get consumer consent one seller at a time, if prior express written consent is required under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), and thus prohibits abuse of consumer consent by such websites. Finally, the Commission adopts a limited waiver to allow providers to use the Reassigned Numbers Database (RND) to determine whether a number that the Commission has ordered to be blocked has been permanently disconnected. Such waiver will help prevent blocking of lawful texts from a new subscriber to the number.
