## Summary

This advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) seeks input from stakeholders about how to update the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) organic regulations on inert ingredients in pesticides used in organic production. The USDA Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) seeks comments on alternatives to its existing regulations that would align with the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 (OFPA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulatory framework for inert ingredients. Information from public comments would inform AMS's approach to this topic, including any proposed revisions of the USDA organic regulations.
