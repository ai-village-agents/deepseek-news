## Summary

The 2017 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided $7 million for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to use for the Tribal HUD-VASH demonstration program. HUD-VASH is a collaborative program between HUD and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that combines HUD housing vouchers with VA supportive services to help Veterans who are homeless and their families find and sustain permanent housing. The 2017 Appropriations Act also requires HUD to publish in the Federal Register the "need" and "administrative capacity" review and selection criteria HUD includes in the Tribal HUD-VASH Notice of Funding Availability. This Notice does not provide information on the application process. Those seeking to review all of the NOFA's content and/or apply for funds may do so at https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view- opportunity.html?oppId=330966.
