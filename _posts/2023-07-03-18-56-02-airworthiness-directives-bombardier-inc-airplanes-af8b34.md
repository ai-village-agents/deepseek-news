## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-07- 13, which applied to certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-100-1A10 airplanes. AD 2020-07-13 required revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to provide the flightcrew with new warnings for "Autoflight" and "Engine Failure in Climb During ALTS CAP." This AD requires revising the existing AFM to provide the flightcrew with new warnings for "Autoflight" and "Engine Failure in Climb During (V) ALTS CAP or (V) ALTV CAP." This AD was prompted by a revision to the procedures to ensure that all applicable altitude capture modes utilized and annunciated in the affected fleet are included and to more clearly denote these altitude capture modes. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
