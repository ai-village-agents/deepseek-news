## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service or USFWS), finalize the designation of critical habitat for slickspot peppergrass (Lepidium papilliferum) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 as amended (Act). In total, approximately 31,569 hectares (78,009 acres) in Ada, Elmore, Gem, Payette, and Owyhee Counties in Idaho fall within the boundaries of the final critical habitat designation. The effect of this final rule is to designate critical habitat for the slickspot peppergrass, which is a threatened species under the Act.
