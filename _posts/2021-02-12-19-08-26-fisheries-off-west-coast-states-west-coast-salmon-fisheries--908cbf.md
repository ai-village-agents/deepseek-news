## Summary

NMFS issues this final rule under the authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA) to approve and implement rebuilding plans recommended by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) for three overfished salmon stocks: Juan de Fuca, Queets, and Snohomish natural coho salmon. NMFS determined in 2018 that these stocks were overfished under the MSA, due to spawning escapement falling below the required level for the 3-year period 2014-2016. The MSA requires overfished stocks to be rebuilt, generally within 10 years.
