## Summary

This regulation establishes exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of Bacteriophage active against Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, Bacteriophage active against Xanthomonas arboricola pv. corylina, Bacteriophage active against Xanthomonas arboricola pv. juglandis, and Bacteriophage active against Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni, in or on all food commodities when used in accordance with label directions and good agricultural practices. OmniLytics, Inc. submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of Bacteriophage active against Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, Bacteriophage active against Xanthomonas arboricola pv. corylina, Bacteriophage active against Xanthomonas arboricola pv. juglandis, and Bacteriophage active against Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni under FFDCA when used in accordance with this exemption.
