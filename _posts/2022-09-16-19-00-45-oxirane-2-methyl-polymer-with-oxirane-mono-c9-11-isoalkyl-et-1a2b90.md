## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of oxirane, 2-methyl-, polymer with oxirane, mono-C9-11-isoalkyl ethers, C10-rich, phosphates, potassium salts (CAS Reg. No. 2275654-37-8), when used as an inert ingredient (surfactant, related adjuvants of surfactant) in pesticide formulations used pre- and post-harvest as well as in formulations applied to livestock. Spring Regulatory Sciences, on behalf of Nouryon Chemicals LLC (USA), submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a tolerance for residues of oxirane, 2-methyl-, polymer with oxirane, mono-C9-11-isoalkyl ethers, C10-rich, phosphates, potassium salts (CAS Reg. No. 2275654-37-8), on food or feed commodities or when applied to livestock.
