## Summary

The NCUA Board (Board) seeks comment on a proposed rule to remove the regulations related to approval and policies on making loans to other credit unions. While this provision will no longer be codified in regulation, Federal Credit Unions would remain subject to statutory requirements related to making loans to credit unions. Federally insured state-chartered credit unions would remain subject to any other applicable NCUA or state law or regulation.
