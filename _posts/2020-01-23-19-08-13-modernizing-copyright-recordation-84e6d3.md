## Summary

The United States Copyright Office is issuing a supplemental interim rule amending its regulations governing recordation of transfers of copyright ownership, notices of termination, and other documents pertaining to a copyright. This rule supplements the Office's current interim recordation regulations in anticipation of the Office's forthcoming pilot program through which participating remitters will be able to record certain types of documents electronically online. The supplemental interim rule and pilot program are the next step in the recordation modernization process, which will lead to a full public release of the Office's electronic recordation system in the future.
