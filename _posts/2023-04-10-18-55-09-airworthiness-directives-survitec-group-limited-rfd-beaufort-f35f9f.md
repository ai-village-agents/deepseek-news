## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Survitec Group Limited (RFD Beaufort Ltd.) Type 102 Mk 3, 102 Mk 4, and 105 Mk 1 life jackets. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that some life jackets were found packed in the wrong valise (container). This proposed AD would require an inspection for a discrepancy (mismatch of the valise/container description and life jacket type) of life jackets and, if necessary, replacement of the life jacket. This proposed AD would also limit the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
