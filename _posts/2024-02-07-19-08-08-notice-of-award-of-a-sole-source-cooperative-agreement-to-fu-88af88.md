The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), located within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), announces the award of approximately $8,000,000, with an expected total funding of approximately $50,000,000 over a 5-year period, to the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO). The award will support strengthening immunization systems; ensuring polio free certification status; maintaining measles, rubella, and neonatal tetanus elimination; and prevention of other vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) in the Americas region.
