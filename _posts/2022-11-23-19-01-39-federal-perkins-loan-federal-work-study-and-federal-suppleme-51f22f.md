## Summary

On January 31, 2022, the Department of Education (Department) published in the Federal Register a notice announcing the 2022-23 Award Year deadline dates (the "Deadline Dates notice") for the submission of requests and documents from postsecondary institutions for the Federal Perkins Loan (Perkins Loan) Program, Federal Work-Study (FWS), and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) programs (collectively, the "Campus-Based programs"). We are correcting the Deadline Dates notice by providing updated mailing addresses for submission of documents. All other information in the Deadline Dates notice remains the same.
