## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of Oxirane, 2-(phenoxymethyl)-, polymer with oxirane, monobutyl ether, block, when used as an inert ingredient in a pesticide chemical formulation. Spring Regulatory Sciences (SRS) on behalf of Stepan Company (Stepan) submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of Oxirane, 2-(phenoxymethyl)-, polymer with oxirane, monobutyl ether, block, on food or feed commodities.
