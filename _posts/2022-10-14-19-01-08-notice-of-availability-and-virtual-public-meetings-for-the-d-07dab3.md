## Summary

Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as implemented by the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations, the DoN prepared and filed with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) that evaluates the potential environmental effects associated with the acquisition of land at the Southeast Federal Center (SEFC), at the Washington Navy Yard (WNY), Washington, DC. The Navy proposes to obtain 6 acres of land on the SEFC (the SEFC E Parcels) to improve the overall Antiterrorism (AT) posture of the WNY. By obtaining the SEFC E Parcels, the Navy would: (1) improve the WNY AT posture by reducing the encroachment threat posed by planned, private development on the SEFC E Parcels; (2) protect mission-critical activities conducted at the WNY from visual surveillance, and acoustic and electronic eavesdropping; and (3) enhance the overall safety of personnel, facilities, and infrastructure at the WNY. Should the Navy obtain ownership of the SEFC E Parcels, the Navy is considering three alternative uses for the acquired property: construction and operation of a relocated Navy Museum, construction of administrative facilities, or maintaining the status quo (no new development).
