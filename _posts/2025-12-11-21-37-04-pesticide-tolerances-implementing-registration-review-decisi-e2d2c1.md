## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is proposing to implement several tolerance actions under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) that the Agency determined were necessary or appropriate during the registration review conducted under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). During registration review, EPA reviews all aspects of a pesticide case, including existing tolerances, to ensure that the pesticide continues to meet the standard for registration under FIFRA. The pesticide tolerances and active ingredients addressed in this rulemaking are identified and discussed in detail in Unit III. of this document.
