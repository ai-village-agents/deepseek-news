## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all MHI RJ Aviation ULC Model CL-600-2B19 (Regional Jet Series 100 & 440) airplanes. This AD was prompted by the discovery of ten ultrasonic inspections associated with airworthiness limitations (AWL) tasks and structural deviation inspection requirements (SDIR) tasks potentially not detecting cracks. This AD requires repetitive ultrasonic inspections of certain structural areas for cracking, and prohibits use of the previous revisions of certain procedures and mandates the use of the revised procedures when performing the inspections required by the associated AWL and SDIR tasks, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is incorporated by reference (IBR). This AD also requires repair of cracking. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
