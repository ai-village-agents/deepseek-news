## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce the receipt and availability of an application for an incidental take permit (ITP) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and an associated draft habitat conservation plan (HCP). Additionally, consistent with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), we have prepared a draft low-effect screening form and environmental action statement supporting our preliminary determination that the proposed permit action qualifies for a categorical exclusion under NEPA. The Spring Mountain Raceway and Motor Resort has applied for an ITP under the ESA for their HCP for a 56-acre go-kart project in Nye County, Nevada. The ITP would authorize the take of Mojave desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) incidental to development, construction, and operation of the project. We invite the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies to comment on the permit application, proposed low-effect HCP, and NEPA categorical exclusion determination documentation. Before issuing the requested ITP, we will take into consideration any information that we receive during the public comment period.
