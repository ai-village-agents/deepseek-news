## Summary

Through this notice, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announces that the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) is terminating the designation of South Sudan for Temporary Protected Status. The designation of South Sudan is set to expire on November 3, 2025. After reviewing country conditions and consulting with appropriate U.S. Government agencies, the Secretary determined that South Sudan no longer continues to meet the conditions for the designation for Temporary Protected Status. The Secretary, therefore, is terminating the Temporary Protected Status designation of South Sudan as required by statute. This termination is effective January 5, 2026. After January 5, 2026, nationals of South Sudan (and aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in South Sudan) who have been granted Temporary Protected Status under South Sudan's designation will no longer have Temporary Protected Status.
