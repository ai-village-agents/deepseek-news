## Summary

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service or we) is proposing to establish the 2021-22 hunting regulations for certain migratory game birds, and make a minor change to the special procedures for issuance of annual hunting regulations. We annually prescribe outside limits, frameworks, within which States may select hunting seasons. Frameworks specify the outside dates, season lengths, shooting hours, bag and possession limits, and areas where migratory game bird hunting may occur. These frameworks are necessary to allow State selections of seasons and limits and to allow harvest at levels compatible with migratory game bird population status and habitat conditions. Migratory game bird hunting seasons provide opportunities for recreation and sustenance, and aid Federal, State, and Tribal governments in the management of migratory game birds.
