## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to partially approve and partially disapprove certain elements of a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision that New Jersey submitted to demonstrate that the State satisfies the infrastructure requirements of section 110(a)(1) and (2) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) for the 2015 8- hour Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The infrastructure requirements are designed to ensure that the structural components of each State's air quality management program are adequate to meet the State's responsibilities under the CAA. Except as noted, this SIP revision satisfies the infrastructure requirements of the CAA for the 2015 ozone NAAQS.
