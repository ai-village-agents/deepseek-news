## Summary

In the July 11, 2022 issue of the Federal Register, we published a final rule that updated proficiency testing (PT) regulations under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) to address current analytes (that is, substances or constituents for which the laboratory conducts testing) and newer technologies. The effective date was August 10, 2022, except for the amendments in amendatory instructions 2 and 5 through 21, which are effective July 11, 2024. This document corrects one technical error identified in the July 11, 2022 final rule.
