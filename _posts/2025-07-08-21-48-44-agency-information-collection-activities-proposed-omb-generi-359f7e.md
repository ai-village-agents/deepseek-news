## Summary

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is announcing an opportunity for public comment on the proposed collection of certain information through voluntary surveys for studies conducted by the agency. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (the PRA), Federal agencies are required to publish notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of information and to allow 60 days for public comment in response to the notice. This notice solicits comments on a generic clearance for the FTC to conduct voluntary surveys/experiments for social and behavioral research that support FTC's consumer protection and competition missions.
