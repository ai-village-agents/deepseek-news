## Summary

As part of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) commitment to safeguard the environment from per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), the agency is announcing the availability of Clean Water Act (CWA) national "Draft Recommended Aquatic Life Ambient Water Quality Criteria for Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)" and "Draft Recommended Aquatic Life Ambient Water Quality Criteria for Perfluorooctane Sulfonic Acid (PFOS)" for a 30-day public comment period. These draft criteria are a priority action identified in EPA's PFAS Strategic Roadmap and reflect the latest scientific knowledge regarding the effects of PFOA and PFOS on freshwater organisms. These draft criteria have undergone external peer review, and EPA has revised the documents accordingly. When these draft CWA recommended criteria are finalized, they will provide information that states and tribes may consider when adopting water quality standards.
