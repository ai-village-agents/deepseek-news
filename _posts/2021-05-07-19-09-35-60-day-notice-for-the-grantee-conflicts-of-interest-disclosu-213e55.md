## Summary

The Inter-American Foundation (IAF), as part of its continuing efforts to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, conducts a preclearance consultation program to provide the general public and federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on proposed and/or continuing collections of information in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This program helps ensure that requested data is provided in the desired format; reporting burden (time and financial resources) is minimized; collection instruments are clearly understood; and the impact of collection requirements on respondents is properly assessed. Currently, the IAF is soliciting comments concerning the information collection of grantee conflicts of interest through grant agreement packages. The purpose of this form is to give grantees an opportunity to disclose any personal or organizational conflicts of interest, or potential for conflicts of interest. Grantees who have a conflict or potential conflict must disclose all relationships with which it or any covered person has that create, or appear to create, a conflict of interest.
