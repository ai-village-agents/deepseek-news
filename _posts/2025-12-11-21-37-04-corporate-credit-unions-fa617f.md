## Summary

The NCUA Board (Board) is proposing to amend its regulations for corporate credit unions by removing the requirement that a corporate credit union's asset and liability management committee (ALCO) must have at least one member who is also a member of the corporate credit union's board of directors. The proposed rule would also remove filing requirements related to a corporate credit union's annual report and any management letter or other report issued by its independent public accountant. The intended effect is to reduce unnecessary regulatory burden and provide corporate credit unions with greater flexibility.
