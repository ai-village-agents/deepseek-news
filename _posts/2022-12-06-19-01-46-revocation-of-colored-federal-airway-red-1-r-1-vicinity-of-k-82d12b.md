## Summary

This action revokes the Colored Federal airway Red 1 (R-1) in the vicinity of King Salmon, AK, due to the airway no longer being used by pilots as the overlaying United States Area Navigation (RNAV) route T-230 provides better navigation capability with a lower minimum enroute altitude (MEA).
