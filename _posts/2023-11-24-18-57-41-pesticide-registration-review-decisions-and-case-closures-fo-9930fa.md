# Pesticide Registration Review; Decisions and Case Closures for Several Pesticides; Notice of Availability; Technical Correction

## Summary

In the Federal Register of October 18, 2023, EPA issued a notice to announce the availability of EPA's interim registration review decisions for the following chemicals: Citric acid and salts, and linalool; and the closure of the registration review case for triadimenol. That notice incorrectly included a DATES section that established a comment deadline of December 18, 2023. A comment period is not necessary or appropriate for that document because the decisions announced in that document are final for triadimenol, and final for the interim phase of the process for citric acid and salts, and linalool. This document corrects that document by reaffirming the nature of all the decisions announced in that document and by closing the comment period it incorrectly established.
