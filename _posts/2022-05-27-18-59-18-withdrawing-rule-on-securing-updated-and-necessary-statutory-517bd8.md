## Summary

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS or Department) is issuing a final rule withdrawing a rule entitled "Securing Updated and Necessary Statutory Evaluations Timely" (SUNSET final rule), which published in the Federal Register of January 19, 2021. The SUNSET final rule was originally scheduled to take effect on March 22, 2021.

HHS is now withdrawing the SUNSET final rule.
