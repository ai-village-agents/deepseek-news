## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to publish its approval of delegation of authority to the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NH DES) for implementing and enforcing the Federal Plan Requirements for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills That Commenced Construction On or Before July 17, 2014 and Have Not Been Modified or Reconstructed Since July 17, 2014 under the Clean Air Act (CAA). On February 6, 2023, the NHDES Commissioner signed a memorandum of agreement (MoA) concerning the delegation of authority of the Federal Plan for existing municipal solid waste landfills to NHDES by EPA. Subsequently, the MoA became effective upon signature of the EPA Region 1 Deputy Regional Administrator on June 27, 2023. This notice informs the public of the MoA, provides a copy of the signed document, and proposes amending regulatory text to acknowledge the delegation of authority.
