## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is publishing this proposed rule to update and clarify several substantive and procedural requirements for water quality certification under Clean Water Act (CWA or the Act) section 401. CWA section 401 is a direct grant of authority to States (and Tribes that have been approved for "treatment as a State" status) to review for compliance with appropriate Federal, State, and Tribal water quality requirements any discharge into waters of the United States that may result from a proposed activity that requires a Federal license or permit. This proposed rule is intended to clarify several aspects of the certification process consistent with the statutory framework.
