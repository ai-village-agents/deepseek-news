## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a revision to the California Air Resources Board (CARB) portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). This revision concerns emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from vapor recovery systems of gasoline cargo tanks. We are approving a local rule that regulates this emission source under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act).
