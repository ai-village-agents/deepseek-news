# National Environmental Policy Act Implementing Regulations

## Summary

The Department of the Interior (Department or DOI) is partially rescinding and making necessary targeted updates to its remaining regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which were promulgated to "supplement" now-rescinded Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) NEPA implementing regulations. Mindful that the Supreme Court recently clarified NEPA is a "purely procedural statute," DOI will henceforth maintain the remainder of its NEPA procedures--which apply only to DOI's internal processes--in a Handbook separate from the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). This interim final rule requests comments on this action and related matters to inform DOI's decision-making.
