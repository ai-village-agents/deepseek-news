## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service or USFWS), determine endangered status under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended, for the Dolphin and Union caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus x peary), a distinct population segment (DPS) of the barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus). After reviewing new survey information received during the public comment period that identified significant decline in the population during a recent 4-year period, we have reevaluated the status of the DPS. Our reassessment concluded that the species is in danger of extinction now. Therefore, we are listing this DPS as endangered under the Act. Listing this DPS as endangered also means that the proposed rule under section 4(d) of the Act will not be finalized or put in place. Rather, the prohibitions under section 9(a)(1) of the Act and our implementing regulations for endangered wildlife will apply to all Dolphin and Union caribou specimens. The Dolphin and Union caribou is native only to Canada.
