## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the availability of and soliciting comment on draft guidance to expand the availability of virucidal claims for antimicrobial pesticides and provide framework for registrants who seek to make such claims. This draft guidance reiterates recommended test methods and guidance for the addition of virucidal claims to products that meet the criteria for hard surface disinfections claims and the addition of virucidal claims to products that meet the criteria for food/non-food contact sanitizer claims consistent with current test guidelines. This draft guidance specifically covers the addition of a virucidal claims to a product that has met the criteria for a bactericidal disinfectant and/or sanitizer. The methods and performance standards applicable to this expanded availability of virucidal claims are the same test methods and performance standards that are currently used to support existing virucidal claims and thus there are no expectations on reduction of product performance against viruses.
