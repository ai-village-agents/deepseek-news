## Summary

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is requiring owner/operators of higher-risk freight railroad carriers, public transportation agencies (including rail mass transit and bus systems), passenger railroad carriers, and over-the-road bus companies, to provide TSA-approved security training to employees performing security-sensitive functions. The training curriculum must teach employees how to observe, assess, and respond to terrorist-related threats and/or incidents. Additionally, TSA is expanding its requirements for security coordinators and reporting of significant security concerns (currently limited to rail operations) to include bus operations within the scope of the regulation's applicability. TSA is amending other provisions of its regulations, as necessary, to implement these requirements.
