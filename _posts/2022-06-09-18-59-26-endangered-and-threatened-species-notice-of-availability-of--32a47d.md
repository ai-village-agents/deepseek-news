# Endangered and Threatened Species; Notice of Availability of an Interim Report on Post-Delisting Monitoring of Nine Distinct Population Segments of Humpback Whales and Notice of Intent To Prepare a Recovery Plan for the Central America, Mexico, and Western North Pacific Distinct Population Segments of Humpback Whales

## Summary

NMFS is announcing the availability of an interim report for the post-delisting monitoring of nine distinct population segments (DPSs) of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). NMFS is also announcing its intent to prepare a recovery plan for three DPSs of humpback whales and requests information from the public. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires NMFS to develop a system to monitor the status of all species that have been recovered and removed from the lists of threatened and endangered species. The available interim report references the post-delisting monitoring plan that was developed for the nine humpback whale DPSs that are not listed as threatened or endangered. This interim report consolidates and evaluates available monitoring data from several-year intervals to summarize the best available information regarding the status of the nine non-listed humpback whale DPSs. The ESA also generally requires NMFS to develop plans for the conservation and survival of federally listed species, i.e., recovery plans. The current species-wide recovery plan originally prepared in 1991 will be replaced by a new recovery plan specific to the endangered Western North Pacific DPS, the endangered Central America DPS, and the threatened Mexico DPS of humpback whales. We request submission of any information on these DPSs of humpback whales, particularly information on the status, threats, and recovery of the DPSs that has become available since the listing status was revised in 2016 and was not considered as part of the critical habitat designation in 2021.
