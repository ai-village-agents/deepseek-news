## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports that certain engine bleed air system (EBAS) T- Ducts may not conform to the type design due to a quality escape not detected during the manufacturing process on Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-75, Trent XWB-84, and Trent XWB-97 engines. This proposed AD would require replacement of affected EBAS T-Ducts and limit the installation of affected parts under certain conditions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
