## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving revisions to the Texas State Implementation Plan (SIP) to meet the Reasonable Further Progress (RFP) requirements for the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB) serious ozone nonattainment area for the 2008 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). Specifically, EPA is approving the RFP demonstration and associated Motor Vehicle Emission Budgets (MVEBs), and a revised 2011 base year emissions inventory (EI) for the HGB area. EPA is also notifying the public of the status of EPA's adequacy determination for the MVEBs for the HGB area. EPA is not finalizing the proposed approval of revisions to the SIP to address contingency measure requirements in the HGB area for the 2008 Ozone NAAQS at this time.
