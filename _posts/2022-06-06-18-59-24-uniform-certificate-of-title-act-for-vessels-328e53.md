## Summary

The Coast Guard is changing its regulations for certifying a State's titling system for undocumented vessels to increase States' participation in the Vessel Identification System (VIS). This final rule allows States that have adopted the recommendations of the model Uniform Certificate of Title Act for Vessels to certify their titling provisions with the Coast Guard. Once certified and participating in the VIS, a State is able to confer preferred mortgage status on financial instruments that apply to undocumented vessels, which benefits the owners of those vessels. While many of the changes to the certification guidelines relate to the technical requirements of recording and maintaining titling documentation, the most significant change implements a system of "branding" (permanently marking) titles for vessels that have sustained structural damage. This will help prevent a process known as "title washing," where severe vessel damage is concealed by transferring the title to a different State.
