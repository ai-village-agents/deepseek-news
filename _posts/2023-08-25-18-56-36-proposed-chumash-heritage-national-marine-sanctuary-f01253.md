## Summary

NOAA proposes to designate Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary (CHNMS) in the waters along and offshore of the coast of central California to recognize the national significance of the area's ecological, historical, archaeological, and cultural resources and to manage this special place as part of the National Marine Sanctuary System. The sanctuary boundary would encompass 5,617 square miles (mi\2\) (4,242 nmi\2\) of submerged lands and marine waters from Monta[ntilde]a de Oro State Park in San Luis Obispo County to Naples along the Gaviota Coast in Santa Barbara County. NOAA proposes to establish the terms of designation for CHNMS and proposes regulations to implement the national marine sanctuary designation. NOAA is also publishing a draft environmental impact statement (draft EIS) and draft management plan, and soliciting public comment on the proposed rule, draft EIS, and draft management plan.
