## Summary

The National Labor Relations Board (the Board) published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Federal Register on November 4, 2022, seeking comments from the public regarding its proposed rule concerning Representation--Case Procedures: Election Bars; Proof of Majority Support in Construction Industry Collective-Bargaining Relationships ("NPRM"). The deadline for initial comments was extended on December 1, 2022, to February 2, 2023, with responsive comments due on February 16, 2023. The date to submit responsive comments to the initial comments is being extended due to an administrative error that occurred within Regulations.gov that inadvertently allowed six comments to be filed on a closed NLRB rulemaking docket from 2018. These comments have been moved to the correct NPRM docket.
