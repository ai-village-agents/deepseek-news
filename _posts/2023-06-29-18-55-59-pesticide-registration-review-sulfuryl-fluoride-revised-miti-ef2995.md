## Summary

This notice announces the availability of EPA's Sulfuryl Fluoride Revised Mitigation and Response to Comments on the Draft Interim Re-Entry Mitigation Measures Memorandum, which is being issued to address human health concerns and in response to EPA's Office of Inspector General 2016 (OIG) Report, Additional Measures Can Be Taken to Prevent Deaths and Serious Injuries from Residential Fumigations (No. 17-P-0053). Sulfuryl flouride is currently in registration review which is EPA's periodic review of pesticide registrations to ensure that each pesticide continues to satisfy the statutory standard for registration, that is, that the pesticide can perform its intended function without causing unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment. Through this program, EPA is ensuring that each pesticide's registration is based on current scientific and other knowledge, including its effects on human health and the environment. EPA may pursue mitigation at any time during the registration review process if it finds that a pesticide poses unreasonable adverse effects to human health or the environment. EPA believes that the mitigation measures outlined in the Sulfuryl Fluoride Revised Mitigation and Response to Comments on the Draft Interim Re-Entry Mitigation Measures Memorandum are necessary to address identified human health risk concerns from the use of sulfuryl fluoride as a structural fumigant in residential use sites.
