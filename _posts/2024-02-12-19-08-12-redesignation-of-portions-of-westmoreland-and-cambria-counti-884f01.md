## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) is providing notice of our intent to redesignate portions of Westmoreland County and Cambria County, Pennsylvania, to "nonattainment" for the 2010 sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS or standard). Westmoreland County is currently designated "attainment/unclassifiable," and Cambria County is currently designated "unclassifiable." EPA's intended redesignation of portions of these counties is based on modeled violations of the 2010 SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS. If the redesignation to nonattainment is finalized, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania would be required to undertake certain planning requirements to reduce SO<INF>2</INF> concentrations within this area, including, but not limited to, the requirement to submit within 18 months of redesignation a revision to the Pennsylvania state implementation plan (SIP) that provides for attainment of the SO<INF>2</INF> standard as expeditiously as practicable, but no later than five years after the date of redesignation to nonattainment. Notice is hereby given that EPA has posted on our public electronic docket and internet website the intended redesignation for relevant portions of Westmoreland and Cambria counties, Pennsylvania under the 2010 SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS. The Agency invites the public to review and provide input on our intended redesignation during the comment period specified in the DATES section. EPA notified the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania of our intended redesignation action via a letter to the Governor on or about February 17, 2023, which is included in the docket for this notice of availability (NOA).
