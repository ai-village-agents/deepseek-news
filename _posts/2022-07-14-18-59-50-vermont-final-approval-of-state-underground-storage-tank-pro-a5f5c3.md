## Summary

Pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA or Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the State of Vermont's Underground Storage Tank (UST) program submitted by the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation (VT DEC). This action is based on the EPA's determination that these revisions satisfy all requirements needed for program approval. This action also proposes to codify EPA's approval of Vermont's State program and incorporate by reference those provisions of the State regulations that we have determined meet the requirements for approval. The provisions will be subject to EPA's inspection and enforcement authorities under sections 9005 and 9006 of RCRA Subtitle I and other applicable statutory and regulatory provisions.
