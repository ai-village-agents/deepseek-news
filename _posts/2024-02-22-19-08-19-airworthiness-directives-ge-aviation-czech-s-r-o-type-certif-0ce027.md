## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-13-07 for all GE Aviation Czech s.r.o. (GEAC) (type certificate previously held by WALTER Engine a.s., Walter a.s., and MOTORLET a.s.) Model M601D-11, M601E-11, M601E-11A, M601E-11AS, M601E-11S, and M601F engines. AD 2021-13-07 required recalculating the life of critical parts and, depending on the results of the recalculation, replacing those critical parts. AD 2021-13-07 also required replacing a certain compressor case. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-13-07, the manufacturer published the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the existing engine maintenance manual (EMM), which includes the calculations for the life of critical parts addressed by AD 2021-13-07 and prompted this AD. This AD continues to require the replacement of a certain centrifugal compressor case. This AD also includes an additional part number as an option for the replacement, and limits the applicability of this AD, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
