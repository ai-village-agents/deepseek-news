## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for certain waters of Lake Superior. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters near Canal Park in Duluth, MN during an air show on July 31, 2024. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Marine Safety Unit Duluth or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
