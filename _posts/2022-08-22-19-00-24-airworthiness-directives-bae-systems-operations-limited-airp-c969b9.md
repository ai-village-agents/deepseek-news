# Airworthiness Directives; BAE Systems (Operations) Limited Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all BAE Systems (Operations) Limited Model BAe 146 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a finding that when the autopilot is engaged, the architecture of the autopilot system does not automatically disconnect the autopilot in response to pilot application of a pitch input or when the electric pitch trim switch on either pilot control wheel is operated. This proposed AD would require modifying the autopilot engagement circuit. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
