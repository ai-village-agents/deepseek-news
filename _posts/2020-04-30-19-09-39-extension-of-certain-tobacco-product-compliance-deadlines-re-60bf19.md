## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the withdrawal of a guidance for industry entitled "Extension of Certain Tobacco Product Compliance Deadlines Related to the Final Deeming Rule," which was issued in 2017. The guidance was intended to assist persons who manufacture, package, sell, offer to sell, distribute, or import for sale and distribution within the United States newly regulated tobacco products, roll-your-own (RYO) tobacco, and cigarette tobacco in complying with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), as amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act), and FDA regulations. FDA is withdrawing the guidance because the compliance deadlines contained therein have passed, have been vacated or stayed, or are otherwise described in other guidance.
