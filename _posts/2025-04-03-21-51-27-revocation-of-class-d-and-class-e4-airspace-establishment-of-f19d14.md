## Summary

This action proposes to remove Class D and E4 airspace at Phillips Army Airfield (AAF) due to the closure of the air traffic control tower. This action proposes to establish Class E2 airspace extending upward from the surface above Phillips AAF, Aberdeen, MD, at the request of the United States Army to provide the required airspace for Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operations at Phillips AAF. This action also proposes to amend Class E5 airspace to accommodate the decommissioning of Aberdeen non-directional radio beacon (NDB), and cancellation of the associated instrument approach procedures. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of IFR operations in the area for existing instrument approaches.
