## Summary

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is requesting revisions and a one-year extension of the currently approved ACF Uniform Project Description (UPD) information collection (UPD; Office of Management and Budget (OMB) # 0970-0139, March 31, 2026 expiration date). This includes transitioning to use one simplified version of the UPD with edits to the language for clarification and plain language purposes. Two versions of the instructions remain in the proposed simplified version to accommodate two development methods. ACF is in the process of identifying more significant revisions to the UPD, which will be submitted through a future information collection request to OMB.
