## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is extending the deadline by which existing certification plans for the certification of restricted use pesticide (RUP) applicators may remain valid until either EPA has approved revised certification plans that conform to the updated federal standards or they expire, whichever is earlier, to November 4, 2023. Federal, state, territory, and tribal certifying authorities with existing certification plans are required to complete revisions to their existing plans conforming with the updated federal standards for RUP applicator certification, and the regulations establish the deadline by which the existing plans will expire unless the revised plans are approved by the Agency. EPA is extending this deadline to allow additional time for any remaining proposed certification plan modifications pending approval to continue being reviewed and approved by EPA without interruption to federal, state, territory, and tribal certification programs or to those who are certified to use RUPs under those programs.
