## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC, Commission, or Agency) proposes to modify an existing system of records, FCC/OIG-3, Investigative and Audit Files (formerly: FCC/OIG-3, Investigative Files) subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. This action is necessary to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act to publish in the Federal Register notice of the existence and character of records maintained by the agency. The FCC uses the investigative and audit files contained in the records in this system to carry out its duties and responsibilities under the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended. This modification changes the scope of this system of records to add new routine uses, to update the exemptions the FCC claims for this system, and to make other changes.
