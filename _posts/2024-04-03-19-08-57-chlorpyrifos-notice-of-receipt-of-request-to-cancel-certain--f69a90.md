## Summary

In accordance with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), EPA is issuing a notice of receipt of request by the registrants in Table 3 of Unit II to voluntarily cancel registrations of certain products containing the pesticide chlorpyrifos or to amend their chlorpyrifos registrations to terminate/delete one or more uses. EPA intends to grant these requests at the close of the comment period for this announcement unless the Agency receives substantive comments within the comment period that would merit its further review of the requests or if the registrants withdraw their request to cancel these uses or products. If these requests are granted, any sale, distribution, or use of the products listed in this notice after the registrations have been cancelled or the uses have been terminated would need to be consistent with the terms as described in the final cancellation order.
