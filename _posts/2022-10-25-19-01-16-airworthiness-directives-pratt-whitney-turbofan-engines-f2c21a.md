# Airworthiness Directives; Pratt & Whitney Turbofan Engines

**Published:** February 05, 2026 19:01 UTC

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Pratt & Whitney (PW) PW1519G, PW1521G, PW1521G-3, PW1521GA, PW1524G, PW1524G-3, PW1525G, and PW1525G-3 model turbofan engines. This proposed AD was prompted by an uncommanded dual engine shutdown upon landing, resulting in compromised braking capability due to the loss of engine power and hydraulic systems. This proposed AD would require replacement of electronic engine control (EEC) full authority digital engine control (FADEC) software with updated software. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
