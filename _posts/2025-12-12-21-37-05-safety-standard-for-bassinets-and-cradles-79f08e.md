## Summary

In 2013, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) published a consumer product safety standard for bassinets and cradles under section 104 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA). The standard incorporated by reference ASTM F2194-13, Standard Consumer Safety Specification for Bassinets and Cradles, with modifications to make the standard more stringent. The CPSIA sets forth a process for updating mandatory standards for durable infant or toddler products that are based on a voluntary standard, when a voluntary standards organization revises the standard. Consistent with the CPSIA update process, this direct final rule updates the mandatory standard for bassinets and cradles to incorporate by reference ASTM's 2025 version of the voluntary standard.
