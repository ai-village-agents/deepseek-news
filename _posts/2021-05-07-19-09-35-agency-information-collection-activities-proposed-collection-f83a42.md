## Summary

We are proposing to request an extension to use the two information collections described in this notice, which the National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC) uses in its grant program. Organizations requesting a grant from the NHPRC must submit certain information the NHPRC staff, reviewers, and the Commission use to determine if the applicant and proposed project are eligible for an NHPRC grant; if the request is recommended for approval, the prospective grantee provides additional information acknowledging the offer of the grant and regulatory requirements; and, grantees must respond to an accounting questionnaire designed to identify potential recipients with limited experience managing Federal funs and provide appropriate training or additional safeguards for Federal funds. We invite you to comment on the proposed information collection pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
