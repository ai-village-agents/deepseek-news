## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 737-100, -200, -200C, -300, -400, and -500 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report indicating that a crack was found in one of the holes of the wing rear spar lower chord at the main landing gear (MLG) aft fitting at a certain wing buttock line (WBL). This AD requires repetitive open hole high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections or surface HFEC and ultrasonic (UT) inspections for cracking of the wing rear spar lower chord at the MLG aft fitting at a certain WBL, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
