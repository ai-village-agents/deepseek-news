## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-9 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of missing sealant on the left and right wing leading edge outboard blowout door. This proposed AD would require doing a fluid seal contact inspection and a detailed inspection for missing sealant on the blowout door and applying sealant if necessary. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
