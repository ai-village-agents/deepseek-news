# Airworthiness Directives; Bell Textron Inc., Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA is revising a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that would have applied to all Bell Textron Inc., Model 204B, 205A, 205A-1, 205B, and 210 helicopters. This AD was prompted by an accident and incidents involving failure of the tail boom attachment structure. This action revises the NPRM by changing the proposed required actions and adding a special flight permit limitation. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive (AD) to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over those in the NPRM, the agency is requesting comments on this SNPRM.
