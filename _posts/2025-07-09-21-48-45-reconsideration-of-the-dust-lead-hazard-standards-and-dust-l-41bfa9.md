## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) is correcting a final rule that appeared in the Federal Register of November 12, 2024, that finalized several revisions to EPA's lead-based paint (LBP) regulations. Subsequent to publication, the Office of the Federal Register (OFR) informed the Agency that there were errors in the amendatory instructions that describe specific revisions for two sections of the regulation. In the Federal Register of December 16, 2024, EPA published a technical correction to the final rule that explained the errors and the corresponding technical corrections that the Agency believed would address the errors identified by the OFR. Unfortunately, that technical correction did not fix the amendatory instructions prior to the effective date of the final rule. As a result, when the final rule became effective on January 13, 2025, three subparagraphs of regulatory text were inadvertently deleted--a change to the post-abatement regulatory activities that EPA did not intend to make. This action corrects that error by restoring the inadvertently deleted text in the regulations.
