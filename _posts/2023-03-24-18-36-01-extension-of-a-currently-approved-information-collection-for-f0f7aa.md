## Summary

The Department of Energy (DOE or the Department), pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995), intends to extend for three years, an information collection request with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The information collection request, Historic Preservation for Energy Efficiency Programs, was initially approved on December 1, 2010, under OMB Control No. 1910-5155 and expired on September 30, 2015. The information collection request was previously approved on February 24, 2020, under OMB Control No. 1910-5155 and its current expiration date was February 28, 2023. This extension will allow DOE to continue data collection on the status of the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP), the State Energy Program (SEP), and the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant (EECBG) Program. Program activities will ensure compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).
