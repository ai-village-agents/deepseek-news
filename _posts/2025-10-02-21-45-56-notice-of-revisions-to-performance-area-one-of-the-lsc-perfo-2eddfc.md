## Summary

The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) proposes to revise Performance Area One of its Performance Criteria. In Performance Area One, LSC establishes the indicators that LSC will use to evaluate grant recipients' processes for identifying the most pressing and emerging legal needs in their service areas and determining how they will deliver legal services tailored to most effectively address those needs. LSC proposes to introduce a new criterion assessing strategic planning as well as to revise the existing criteria examining grant recipients' conduct of needs assessments, implementation of strategies to address legal needs, and self-examination of their effectiveness in delivering legal services.
