## Summary

This action amends Class D airspace, Class E surface area, and Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface for Columbus Airport and Lawson Army Air Field (AAF) (Fort Benning), Columbus, GA. This action merges Columbus Airport and Lawson AAF (Fort Benning) Class D airspace and Class E surface area airspace into one header under FAA Order JO 7400.11 and removes the header Columbus Lawson AAF under FAA Order JO 7400.11. This action also amends Columbus Airport's Class D by updating the name of Columbus Airport, (formerly Columbus Metropolitan Airport) and updating the name of Lawson Army Airfield (Fort Benning), (formerly Columbus Lawson AAF); the Lawson AAF (Fort Benning) Class D is amended by establishing an extension to the southeast. This action establishes Class E airspace designated as an extension to a Class D surface area for Columbus Airport, Columbus, GA. The Columbus Airport Class E surface area extension is eliminated and Lawson AAF (Fort Benning) Class E surface area is amended by establishing an extension to the southeast. Columbus Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface and Lawson AAF (Fort Benning) Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface is amended by increasing the radii and removing the Lawson Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range with Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) and Lawson Localizer (LOC) from the description. In addition, this action also makes an editorial change replacing the term Airport/ Facility Directory with the term Chart Supplement in the legal descriptions of associated Class D airspace and Class E surface area. In addition, this action updates the geographic coordinates of the Lawson AAF (Fort Benning) to coincide with the FAA's database. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.
