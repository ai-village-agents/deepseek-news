## Summary

The Build America, Buy America Act (BABA), enacted as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) on November 15, 2021, requires iron, steel, manufactured products, and construction materials used in infrastructure projects funded by Federal financial assistance to be produced in the United States. DOT is seeking input on the requirement as applied to construction materials: how the requirement should be interpreted and implemented, the present availability of construction materials produced in the United States that are commonly used in transportation infrastructure projects, and the potential impacts to DOT-funded projects.
