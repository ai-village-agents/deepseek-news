## Summary

In accordance with the Clean Air Act, as amended ("CAA" or the "Act"), notice is hereby given of a proposed Settlement Agreement to resolve petitions for review filed by the State of Wyoming ("Wyoming") and PacifiCorp with respect to PacifiCorp's Wyodak electric generating unit (EGU). In 2014, Wyoming and PacifiCorp filed petitions for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, challenging EPA's final rule, in which the Agency partially approved and partially disapproved elements of Wyoming's Regional Haze State Implementation Plan (SIP), and promulgated a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) to address the disapproved elements. In the Final rule, EPA, inter alia, disapproved Wyoming's determination concerning nitrogen oxide (NO<INF>X</INF>) best available retrofit technology (BART) for Wyodak and promulgated a FIP addressing NO<INF>X</INF> BART requirements for Wyodak. The Settlement Agreement would resolve Wyoming's and PacifiCorp's challenges to the final rule. Under the proposed Settlement Agreement, the parties agree to take certain specified actions.
