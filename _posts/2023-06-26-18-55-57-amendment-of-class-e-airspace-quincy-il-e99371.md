## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace at Quincy, IL. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of an airspace review due to the decommissioning of the Quincy very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimum Operating Network (MON) Program. The name and geographic coordinates of the airport and name of the navigational aid would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
