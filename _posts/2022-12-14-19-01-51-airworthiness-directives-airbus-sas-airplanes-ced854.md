## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-22- 04, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A318-111, -112, -121, and - 122 airplanes, Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes, Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes, and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, 213, -231, and - 232 airplanes. AD 2021-22-04 required a one-time eddy current conductivity measurement of certain structural parts of the outer flaps to determine if the incorrect alloy was used, and replacement if necessary; and also required a one-time eddy current conductivity measurement of certain other structural parts of the outer flaps to determine if the parts were properly heat treated, and replacement if necessary. This AD was prompted by the issuance of an updated list of suspected parts, including those that may have been improperly heat treated. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2021-22-04, and requires using an updated list of suspected parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also limits the installation of affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
