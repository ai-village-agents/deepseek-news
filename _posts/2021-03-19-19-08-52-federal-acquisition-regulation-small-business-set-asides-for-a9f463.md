## Summary

DoD, GSA, and NASA are withdrawing the proposed rule to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) titled: Small Business Set Asides for Research and Development Contracts. The decision not to proceed with a final rule was made because of the passage of time since the proposed rule was issued, and input from respondents indicating that the proposed changes were, on balance, unnecessary or unhelpful. Accordingly, this proposed rule is withdrawn, and the FAR case is closed.
