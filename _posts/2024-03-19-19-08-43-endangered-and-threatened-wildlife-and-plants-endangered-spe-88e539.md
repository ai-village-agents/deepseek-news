## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to list the bushy whitlow-wort (Paronychia congesta), a perennial herbaceous plant species from northwestern Jim Hogg County in south Texas, as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). This determination also serves as our 12-month finding on a petition to list the bushy whitlow-wort. After a review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that listing the species is warranted. We also propose to designate critical habitat for the bushy whitlow-wort under the Act. In total, approximately 41.96 acres (16.98 hectares) in Jim Hogg County, Texas, fall within the boundaries of the proposed critical habitat designation. We announce the availability of a draft economic analysis (DEA) of the proposed designation of critical habitat for bushy whitlow-wort. If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would extend the Act's protections to the species and its designated critical habitat.
