## Summary

NMFS has determined that eight exempted fishing permit (EFP) applications warrant further consideration and is requesting public comment on the applications. All EFP applicants request an exemption from a single prohibition (the use of unauthorized gear to harvest highly migratory species (HMS)) under the Fishery Management Plan for the United States (U.S.) West Coast Fisheries for Highly Migratory Species (HMS FMP) to test the effects and efficacy of using standard deep-set buoy gear (DSBG), and/or deep-set linked buoy gear (DSLBG), to harvest swordfish and other HMS off of the U.S. West Coast.
