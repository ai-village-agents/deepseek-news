## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the Missouri State Implementation Plan (SIP) received on February 15, 2019. The submission revises a Missouri regulation that establishes nitrogen oxide (NO<INF>X</INF>) control equipment and NO<INF>X</INF> emission levels for Portland cement kilns. Specifically, the revisions add a definition, remove obsolete dates, update references to test methods, clarify rule language, remove unnecessary words, and make other minor edits. These revisions do not impact the stringency of the SIP and do not impact air quality. Approval of these revisions will ensure consistency between State and federally-approved rules.
