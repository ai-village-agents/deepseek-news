## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, are initiating 5-year status reviews under the Endangered Species Act for 66 animal and plant species. A 5-year review is an assessment of the best scientific and commercial data available at the time of the review to ensure the accuracy of the species' classification as endangered or threatened. We are requesting submission of any such information that has become available since the previous status review for each species.
