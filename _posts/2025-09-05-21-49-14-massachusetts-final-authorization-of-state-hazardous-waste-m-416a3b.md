## Summary

Massachusetts has applied to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended. The EPA has reviewed Massachusetts' application and has determined that these revisions satisfy all requirements needed to qualify for final authorization. Therefore, we are taking direct final action to authorize the State's changes. In the "Proposed Rules" section of this Federal Register, EPA is also publishing a separate document that serves as the proposal to authorize these revisions. Unless EPA receives written comments that oppose this authorization during the comment period, the decision to authorize Massachusetts' revisions to its hazardous waste program will take effect.
