## Summary

The Pacific Fishery Management Council has submitted Amendment 23 to the Coastal Pelagic Species (CPS) Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for review by the Secretary of Commerce. If approved, Amendment 23 would implement a revised rebuilding plan for the northern subpopulation of Pacific sardine. This proposed amendment is intended to promote the goals and objectives of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act or MSA), the CPS FMP, and other applicable laws. NMFS will consider public comments in deciding whether to approve, disapprove, or partially approve Amendment 23. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), as amended, NMFS also announces the availability of a draft environmental assessment that analyzes the potential effects of the associated proposed amendment.
