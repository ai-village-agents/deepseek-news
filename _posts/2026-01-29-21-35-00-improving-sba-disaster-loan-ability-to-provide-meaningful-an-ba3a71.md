## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA or Agency) is issuing this interim final rule (IFR) to ensure the timely and effective delivery of assistance under the Disaster Loan Program authorized under section 7(b) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(b)) ("Disaster Loan Program") following a Presidentially declared disaster. This rule preempts certain state and local requirements impacting the repair, rehabilitation, or replacement of damaged or destroyed property and associated activities financed by the Disaster Loan Program when such requirements cause delay in the use of SBA Disaster Loan Program proceeds. The rule is necessary to reconcile non- federal requirements that undermine Congress's objective of rapid housing and business recovery, public health and safety restoration, and economic stabilization after disasters.
