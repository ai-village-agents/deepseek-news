## Summary

The Federal Labor Relations Authority (Authority) solicits written comments on a request from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for a general statement of policy or guidance (general statement) holding that "zipper clauses"--which are provisions that would foreclose or limit mid-term bargaining during the term of a collective-bargaining agreement (CBA)--are a mandatory subject of bargaining. Comments are solicited on whether the Authority should issue a general statement, and, if so, what the Authority's policy or guidance should be.
