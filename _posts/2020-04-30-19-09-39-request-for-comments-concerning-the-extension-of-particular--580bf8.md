## Summary

Effective July 6, 2018, the U.S. Trade Representative imposed additional duties on goods of China with an annual trade value of approximately $34 billion as part of the action in the Section 301 investigation of China's acts, policies, and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation. The U.S. Trade Representative initiated the exclusion process in July 2018 and granted multiple sets of exclusions. He granted the sixth set of exclusions in July 2019, which are scheduled to expire on July 9, 2020. The U.S. Trade Representative has decided to consider a possible extension for up to 12 months of particular exclusions granted in July 2019. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) invites public comment on whether to extend particular exclusions.
