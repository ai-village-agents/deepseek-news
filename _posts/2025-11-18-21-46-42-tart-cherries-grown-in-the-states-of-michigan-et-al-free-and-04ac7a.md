## Summary

This proposed rule would implement a recommendation from the Cherry Industry Administrative Board (Board) to establish free market tonnage percentages (free percentages) and restricted percentages for the 2024-25 crop year under the Federal marketing order for tart cherries grown in the states of Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin. This action would establish the proportion of tart cherries from the 2024-25 crop which may be handled in commercial outlets. This action should stabilize marketing conditions by adjusting supply to meet market demand and help improve grower returns.
