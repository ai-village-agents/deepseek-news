## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to disestablish the presedential security zone that encompasses certain waters of the Lake Worth Lagoon, Intracoastal Waterway (ICW), and Atlantic Ocean near the Mar-A-Lago Club, and the Southern Boulevard Bridge in Palm Beach, Florida (FL). The security zone is no longer needed to protect official parties, public, or surrounding waterways from terrorist acts, sabotage or other subversive acts, accidents, or other events of a similar nature. This proposed action would remove existing regulations that restrict vessel movement through the area. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
