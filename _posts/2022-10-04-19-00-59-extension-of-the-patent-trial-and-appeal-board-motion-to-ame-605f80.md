## Summary

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is extending the Motion to Amend (MTA) Pilot Program, initiated on March 15, 2019, and first extended on September 16, 2021. The MTA Pilot Program provides additional options for a patent owner who files an MTA in an America Invents Act (AIA) trial proceeding before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB). In particular, the program provides a patent owner who files an MTA with options to request preliminary guidance from the PTAB on the MTA and to file a revised MTA. The MTA Pilot Program also provides timelines for briefing to accommodate these options.
