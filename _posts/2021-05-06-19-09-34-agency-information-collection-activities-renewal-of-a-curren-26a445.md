## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FMCSA announces its plan to submit the Information Collection Request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval. The Executive Order, "Setting Customer Service Standards," directs Federal agencies to provide service to the public that matches or exceeds the best service available in the private sector. These principles were reaffirmed in the Executive Order, "Streamlining Service Delivery and Improving Customer Service." In order to work continuously to ensure that our programs are effective and meet our customers' needs, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) seeks to obtain OMB approval of a currently approved generic clearance to continue collecting feedback on our service delivery. By feedback we mean information that provides useful insights on perceptions and opinions but are not statistical surveys that yield quantitative results that can be generalized to the population of study.
