## Summary

We, NMFS, designate critical habitat for five threatened Indo- Pacific coral species, Acropora globiceps, A. retusa, A. speciosa, Fimbriaphyllia paradivisa (formerly Euphyllia paradivisa), and Isopora crateriformis, pursuant to section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Final critical habitat includes 18 specific areas encompassing approximately 237 square kilometers (km\2\; 92 square miles, mi\2\) of marine habitat in American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Pacific Remote Island Areas, and Hawai[revaps]i. We have considered economic, national security, and other relevant impacts of the designations, but are not excluding any areas from the critical habitat designations due to anticipated impacts.
