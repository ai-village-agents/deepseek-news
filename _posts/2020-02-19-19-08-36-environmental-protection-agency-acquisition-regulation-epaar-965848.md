# Environmental Protection Agency Acquisition Regulation (EPAAR) Clause Update for Submission of Invoices

**Published:** February 05, 2026 19:08 UTC
**Source:** Federal Register
**Original Published:** February 19, 2020 00:00 UTC
**Document Number:** 2020-02269

## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is revising its Submission of Invoices clause to add electronic invoicing requirements. In 2019 the EPA will begin using the Invoice Processing Platform (IPP), which is a secure web-based service provided by the U.S. Treasury that efficiently manages government invoicing. This republication is necessary because the wrong Code of Federal Regulations number appeared in the document header, the List of Subjects, and the words of issuance.
