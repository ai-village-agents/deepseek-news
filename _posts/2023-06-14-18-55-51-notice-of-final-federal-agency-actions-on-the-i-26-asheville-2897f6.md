## Summary

This notice announces actions taken by FHWA and the other Federal agencies that are final. The actions relate to the proposed improvements to upgrade the I-26 corridor in Asheville from south of the I-26/I-40/I-240 interchange through the I-240 interchange with US 19-23-74A/Patton Avenue west of the French Broad River so that I-240 can be redesignated as I-26 in Buncombe County, North Carolina. The project is commonly referred to as the I-26 Asheville Connector and is identified as State Transportation Improvement Program Project (STIP) No. I-2513. Those actions grant licenses, permits, and approvals for the project.
