## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-19-20, which applies to all Dassault Aviation Model FALCON 7X airplanes. AD 2021-19-20 requires amending the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to incorporate a check and an operating limitation regarding the O<INF>2</INF> saver function. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-19-20, it has been determined that the AFM update may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of failed deactivation of the O<INF>2</INF> saver function. This proposed AD would retain the requirements of AD 2021-19-20 and would require physical deactivation of the O<INF>2</INF> saver function, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. This proposed AD would also limit the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
