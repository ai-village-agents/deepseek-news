## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finds that Huntington Township in Huntington County, Indiana (hereafter referred to as "Huntington area") is attaining the 2010 sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). EPA is approving Indiana's request to redesignate the Huntington area from nonattainment to attainment for the 2010 SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS because the request meets the statutory requirements for redesignation under the Clean Air Act (CAA). EPA is also approving Indiana's maintenance plan for the area as part of Indiana's federally enforceable State Implementation plan (SIP).
