## Summary

We, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce receipt of an application from Malabar PO, LLC and Stellar Communities, LLC (applicants) for an incidental take permit (ITP) under the Endangered Species Act. The applicants request the ITP to take the federally listed Audubon's crested caracara (Polyborus plancus audubonii) incidental to the construction, operation, maintenance, vegetative management, and occupancy of a residential development in Brevard County, Florida. We request public comment on the application, which includes the applicants' proposed habitat conservation plan (HCP), and on the Service's preliminary determination that the proposed permitting action may be eligible for a categorical exclusion pursuant to the Council on Environmental Quality's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations, the Department of the Interior's (DOI) NEPA regulations, and the DOI Departmental Manual. To make this preliminary determination, we prepared a draft environmental action statement and low-effect screening form, both of which are also available for public review. We invite comment from the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies.
