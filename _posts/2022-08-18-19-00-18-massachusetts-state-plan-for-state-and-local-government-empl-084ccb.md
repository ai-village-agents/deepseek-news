## Summary

The Massachusetts State and Local Government Only State Plan, a State occupational safety and health, applicable only to Massachusetts State and local Government employees (workers of the State and its political subdivisions), is approved as a developmental plan under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and OSHA regulations. OSHA's decision to grant the Massachusetts State Plan initial approval is based on its determination that the Massachusetts State Plan meets, or will meet within three years, OSHA's State Plan approval criteria, and that Massachusetts has provided adequate assurances that it will be at least as effective as Federal OSHA in protecting the safety and health of Massachusetts State and local Government workers. The Massachusetts State Plan is eligible to receive funding from the Department of Labor's Fiscal Year 2022 budget.
