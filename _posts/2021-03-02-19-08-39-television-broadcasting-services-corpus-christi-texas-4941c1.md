## Summary

The Commission has before it a petition for rulemaking (Petition) filed by Scripps Broadcasting Holdings, LLC (Scripps or the Petitioner), licensee of KRIS-TV, channel 13, Corpus Christi, Texas, requesting the substitution of channel 26 for channel 13 at Corpus Christi in the DTV Table of Allotments. Scripps states that it has received numerous complaints from viewers saying that they are unable to receive the station on channel 13, and that it is apparent that the KRIS-TV VHF signal is not providing viewers with the quality of service provided by UHF stations in the market. Scripps further states that the station is now silent, after a wind storm in April 2020 caused the tower to collapse, and Scripps would prefer to construct a new UHF facility on channel 26 in order to significantly improve off-air service, rather than replace the VHF channel 13 facility.
