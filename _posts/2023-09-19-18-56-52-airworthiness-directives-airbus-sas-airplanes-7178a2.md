## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-06- 10, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2020-06-10 required repetitive inspections for cracking of the vertical stiffeners of the left- and right-hand sides of the window frames and corrective actions if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-06-10, it was determined that certain compliance times need to be reduced. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2020-06-10, with amended compliance times, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
