This action proposes to remove Jet Route J-590, amend Very High Frequency (VHF) Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-11 and V-70, and establish Area Navigation (RNAV) route T-365. The FAA is proposing this action due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Greene County, MS (GCV), VOR/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) navigational aid (NAVAID). The Greene County VOR is being decommissioned in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
