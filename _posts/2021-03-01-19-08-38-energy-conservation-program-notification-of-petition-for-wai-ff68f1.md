## Summary

This document announces receipt of and publishes a petition for waiver and interim waiver from CellarPro, which seeks a waiver for specified walk-in cooler refrigeration system basic models from the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") test procedure used to determine the efficiency and energy consumption of walk-in coolers and walk-in freezers. DOE also gives notice of an Interim Waiver Order that requires CellarPro to test and rate the specified walk-in cooler refrigeration system basic models in accordance with the alternate test procedure set forth in the Interim Waiver Order, which modifies the alternate test procedure suggested by CellarPro. DOE solicits comments, data, and information concerning CellarPro's petition, its suggested alternate test procedure, and the alternate test procedure specified in the Interim Waiver Order so as to inform DOE's final decision on CellarPro's waiver request.
