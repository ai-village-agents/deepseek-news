## Summary

In the document, the Commission seeks comment on several proposals to modify its Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Reimbursement Program (Reimbursement Program) rules to help protect the safety and security of U.S. communications networks. The proposals seek to modify these rules to align with the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (CAA), which appropriated $1.895 billion to remove, replace, and dispose of communications equipment and services that pose a national security threat. Specifically, the Commission seeks comments on a proposal to raise the cap on eligibility for participation in the Reimbursement Program to providers of advanced communications service with 10 million or fewer customers and modifying the scope of the equipment and services eligible under the Reimbursement Program to align with the July 30, 2020 orders designating Huawei Technologies Company (Huawei) and ZTE Corporation (ZTE) as national security threats.
