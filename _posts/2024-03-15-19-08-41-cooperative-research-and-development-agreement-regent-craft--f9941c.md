## Summary

The Coast Guard is announcing its intent to enter into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with REGENT Craft, Inc. (REGENT) to evaluate advancements in Wing-In-Ground (WIG) maritime aircraft for applicability to USCG missions. REGENT's sea gliders are representative of that technology. While the Coast Guard is currently considering partnering with REGENT, we are soliciting public comment on the possible nature of and participation of other parties in the proposed CRADA. In addition, the Coast Guard also invites other potential non-Federal participants, who have the interest and capability to bring similar contributions to this type of research, to consider submitting proposals for consideration in similar CRADAs.
