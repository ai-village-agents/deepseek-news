# Airworthiness Directives; International Aero Engines, LLC Engines

## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-19-15, which applies to certain International Aero Engines, LLC (IAE LLC) Model PW1100G series engines; and AD 2023-16-07, which applies to certain IAE LLC Model PW1100G series engines and PW1400G series engines. AD 2022-19-15 requires an angled ultrasonic inspection (AUSI) of the high-pressure turbine (HPT) 1st-stage disk and HPT 2nd- stage disk, and replacement if necessary. AD 2023-16-07 requires an AUSI of the HPT 1st-stage hub (also known as the HPT 1st-stage disk) and HPT 2nd-stage hub (also known as the HPT 2nd-stage disk) for cracks, and replacement if necessary, which is terminating action for AD 2022-19-15. Since the FAA issued these two ADs, an investigation determined an increased risk of powder metal anomalies for all powder metal parts in certain powder metal production campaigns, which are susceptible to failure significantly earlier than previously determined. This proposed AD would retain the AUSI requirement for certain HPT 1st-stage and HPT 2nd-stage hubs from AD 2023-16-07. This proposed AD would also require performing an AUSI of the HPT 1st-stage hub, HPT 2nd-stage hub, high-pressure compressor (HPC) 7th-stage integrally bladed rotor (IBR-7), and HPC 8th-stage integrally bladed rotor (IBR-8) for cracks and replacement if necessary. This proposed AD would also require accelerated replacement of the HPC IBR-7, HPC IBR-8, HPC rear hub, HPT 1st-stage hub, HPT 1st-stage air seal, HPT 1st-stage blade retaining plate, HPT 2nd-stage hub, HPT 2nd-stage blade retaining plate, and HPT 2nd-stage rear seal. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
