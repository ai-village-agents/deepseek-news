## Summary

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) seeks approval for an extension with no changes to a one-time study to examine familial outcomes 8 years or more after a child's adoption from the child welfare system. The primary objective of this study is to estimate the prevalence of instability events that occur in families who have adopted children who have exited the foster care system. The second objective is to understand risk and protective factors associated with post adoption instability. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval expires September 30, 2021, and this request is to extend approval to allow for the completion of data collection.
