## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), determine that the Canoe Creek clubshell (Pleurobema athearni), a freshwater mussel species endemic to a single watershed in north-central Alabama, is an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. We also designate critical habitat for the species under the Act. In total, approximately 58.5 river kilometers (36.3 river miles) in St. Clair and Etowah Counties, Alabama, fall within the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. This rule extends the Act's protections to the species and its designated critical habitat.
