## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing for public comment draft regulatory guide (DG), DG-1371, "Quality Group Classifications and Standards for Water-, Steam-, and Radioactive- Waste-Containing Components of Nuclear Power Plants." This proposed Revision 6 of Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.26, incorporates additional information that provides guidance for alternative quality classification systems for components in light-water reactor (LWR) nuclear power plants and updates the staff position regarding classification of Quality Group C components to reflect the latest guidance on systems that contain radioactive material since Revision 5 (02/2017), of RG 1.26 was issued. The appendices to this RG provide guidance for alternative quality classification systems for components in LWR nuclear power plants.
