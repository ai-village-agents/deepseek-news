## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class D airspace at the Mountain Home Air Force Base Airport by removing the extensions to the northwest and southeast of the airport. This action also proposes to amend the Class E surface area to match the new dimensions of the Class D. Additionally, this action proposes to amend the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface by properly sizing the area to contain arriving IFR aircraft descending below 1,500 feet above the surface and departing IFR aircraft until reaching 1,200 feet above the surface. This action also proposes to properly size the Class E airspace extending upward from 1,200 feet above the surface to contain IFR aircraft transitioning to/ from the en route environment. Further, this action proposes to remove Mountain Home Municipal Airport from the Class E airspace legal description for the area extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface. A notice of proposed rulemaking and Final Rule, FAA-2019- 0972, have been published to establish Class E airspace, extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface, for Mountain Home Municipal Airport. Lastly, this action proposes two administrative corrections to the airspace legal descriptions.
