## Summary

The Rural Housing Service (RHS or the Agency), a Rural Development (RD) agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), proposes to amend its regulation to implement changes related to insurance requirements under the Multi-Family Housing (MFH) Direct Loan and Grant programs. The intent of this proposed rule is to align RD insurance coverage types, amounts, and deductibles with affordable housing industry standards to simplify the coverage amounts, deductible limits, and improve the customer experience with updated and understandable insurance requirements.
