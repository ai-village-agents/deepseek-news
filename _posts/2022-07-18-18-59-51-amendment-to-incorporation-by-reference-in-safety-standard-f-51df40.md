## Summary

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission or CPSC) previously published a consumer product safety standard for high chairs under section 104 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA). The CPSC mandatory standard incorporates by reference the ASTM voluntary standard for high chairs. ASTM recently updated this voluntary standard. Pursuant to the CPSIA, the updated ASTM standard will become the CPSC mandatory standard for high chairs effective July 23, 2022. The Commission is issuing a final rule to update the version of the standard that is incorporated by reference in its regulations to reflect the version that will be mandatory by operation of law under the CPSIA.
