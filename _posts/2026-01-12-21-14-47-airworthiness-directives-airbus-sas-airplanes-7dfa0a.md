## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, - 132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320 series airplanes; and Model A321- 211, -212, -213, -231,-232, -251N, -251NX, -252N, -252NX, -253N, - 253NX, -271N, -271NX, -272N, and -272NX airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a review of the cold working process on the assembly line that detected a deviation to the manufacturing process. This proposed AD would require repetitive inspections for the nominal design condition of the fastener holes in the pressure deck membrane to center wing box attachment and, as applicable, an inspection for cracking at the affected area and corrective actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
