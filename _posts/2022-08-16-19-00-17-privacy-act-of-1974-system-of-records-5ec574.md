## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of the Interior (DOI) is issuing a public notice of its intent to rescind the Privacy Act system of records, INTERIOR/SOL-4, Workload Analysis, from its existing inventory. During a routine review of DOI system of records notices (SORNs), it was determined that this system of records is no longer necessary as the records in the system are covered under the INTERIOR/DOI-85, Payroll, Attendance, Retirement and Leave Records, SORN. This rescindment will promote the overall streamlining and management of DOI Privacy Act systems of records.
