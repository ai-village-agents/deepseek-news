## Summary

The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) is amending the Agricultural Trade Promotion Program regulation to implement the Regional Agricultural Promotion Program (RAPP). The RAPP will provide assistance to eligible organizations that conduct market promotion activities, including activities to address existing or potential non- tariff barriers to trade, to promote U.S. agricultural commodities in certain foreign markets. Among other changes, this rule updates terminology used throughout the regulation, clarifies timeframes for reporting requirements, and removes the specific application and review requirements from the regulation to be defined in Notices of Funding Opportunity (NOFOs) announced through the Grants.gov website.
