## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, are correcting our April 16, 2020, notice that published an amended list of the nonnative bird species that have been introduced by humans into the United States or U.S. territories and to which the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) does not apply. That list erroneously included one bird species, European Robin (Erithacus rubecula), that is covered by the MBTA.
