## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve in part and conditionally approve in part revisions to the Imperial County Air Pollution Control District (ICAPCD or ``District'') portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern the ICAPCD's Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) requirements for the 2008 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) and negative declarations for several source categories. We are approving the local SIP revisions to demonstrate that RACT is implemented as required under the Clean Air Act (CAA or ``the Act'').
