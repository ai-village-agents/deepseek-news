## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") is re- proposing amendments to a rule under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Act" or "Exchange Act") that exempts certain registered brokers or dealers from membership in a registered national securities association ("Association"). The re-proposed amendments would replace the rule's de minimis allowance, including the exclusion therefrom for proprietary trading, with narrower exemptions from Association membership for any registered broker or dealer that is a member of a national securities exchange, carries no customer accounts, and effects transactions in securities otherwise than on a national securities exchange of which it is a member. The re-proposed amendments would create exemptions for such a registered broker or dealer that effects transactions off an exchange of which it is a member that result solely from orders that are routed by a national securities exchange of which it is a member to comply with order protection regulatory requirements, or are solely for the purpose of executing the stock leg of a stock- option order.
