## Summary

Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), this notice announces that the Department of Transportation (DOT) is forwarding the Information Collection Request (ICR) abstracted below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and comment. The ICR describes the information collection and its expected burden. On September 6, 2023, DOT published a notice providing a 60-day period for public comment on the ICR. DOT received no comments on this notice. This collection is necessary for administration of the Reconnecting Communities (RCP) and Neighborhood Access and Equity (NAE) Discretionary Grant Programs and funding opportunities. Together, these programs are known as "Reconnecting Communities and Neighborhoods (RCN)" in the combined NOFO. RCN provides federal financial assistance for surface transportation infrastructure projects. Through RCP, this includes removing, retrofitting, or mitigating transportation facilities such as highways and rail lines that create barriers to community connectivity including to mobility, access, or economic development. Through NAE, this includes the RCP eligibilities and expands eligibility to activities that reduce the burdens to communities of existing transportation infrastructure, including air quality impacts and greenhouse gas emissions, urban heat islands, gaps in tree canopy coverage, and other natural environment concerns.
