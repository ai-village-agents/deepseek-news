## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for type certificated Model UH-1H restricted category helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by multiple reports of failure of the main driveshaft. This proposed AD would require establishing a life limit for certain main driveshafts, and a one-time and repetitive inspections of the main driveshafts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
