## Summary

The South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council) submitted Amendment 52 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Snapper- Grouper Fishery of the South Atlantic (FMP) for review, approval, and implementation by NMFS. If approved by the Secretary of Commerce, Amendment 52 to the FMP would revise the acceptable biological catch (ABC), overfishing limit (OFL), annual catch limits (ACLs), annual optimum yield (OY), sector allocations, commercial longline component fishing season, and recreational accountability measures (AMs) for golden tilefish. For blueline tilefish, Amendment 52 would reduce the recreational bag limit, modify the possession limits, and revise the recreational AMs. The purpose of Amendment 52 is to respond to the most recent stock assessment for golden tilefish and to prevent recreational landings from exceeding the recreational ACLs for golden tilefish and blueline tilefish.
