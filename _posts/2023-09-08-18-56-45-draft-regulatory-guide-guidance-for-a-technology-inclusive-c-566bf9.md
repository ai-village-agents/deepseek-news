## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is soliciting public comment on Appendix B and conforming changes to other parts of its draft Regulatory Guide (DG), DG-1404, Revision 1 "Guidance for a Technology-Inclusive Content-of-Application Methodology to Inform the Licensing Basis and Content of Applications for Licenses, Certifications, and Approvals for Non-Light-Water Reactors." On May 25, 2023, the NRC published Revision 0 to DG-1404 requesting public comment, and on June 28, 2023, the NRC extended the public comment period to August 10, 2023. Since then, and consistent with item 1 in Appendix A to DG-1404, Revision 0, the NRC completed its development of Appendix B and revised DG-1404 (i.e., Revision 1) to include this appendix and made conforming changes to other parts of the document. Appendix B provides additional guidance for the scope, level of detail, elements, and plant representation for a probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) supporting a Licensing Modernization Project (LMP)-based construction permit application.
