## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing an opportunity for public comment on the proposed collection of certain information by the Agency. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), Federal Agencies are required to publish notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of information, including each proposed extension of an existing collection of information, and to allow 60 days for public comment in response to the notice. This notice solicits comments on the generic clearance for testing communications on medical devices and radiation-emitting products by FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). This generic ICR facilitates CDRH's efforts to assess the need for communications on specific topics and to assist in the development and modification of communication messages to promote public health and compliance with regulations.
