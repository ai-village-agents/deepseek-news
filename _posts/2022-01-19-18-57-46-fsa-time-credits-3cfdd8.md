## Summary

This rule codifies the Bureau of Prisons' (Bureau or BOP) procedures regarding the earning and application of time credits as authorized by the First Step Act of 2018 (FSA), hereinafter referred to as "FSA Time Credits" or "Time Credits." The FSA provides that eligible inmates earn FSA Time Credits toward prerelease custody or early transfer to supervised release for successfully completing approved Evidence-Based Recidivism Reduction (EBRR) Programs or Productive Activities (PAs) assigned to each inmate based on the inmate's risk and needs assessment. Inmates eligible to apply Time Credits under the FSA include individuals sentenced under the U.S. Code. As required by the FSA, an inmate cannot earn FSA Time Credits if that inmate is serving a sentence for a disqualifying offense or has a disqualifying prior conviction. However, such inmates may still earn other benefits for successfully completing recidivism reduction programming, such as increased privileges (commissary, visiting, and telephone) for participation in EBRR Programs or PAs, as authorized by the Bureau.
