# Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Rear Impact Guards; Denial of Petition for Rulemaking

**Published:** February 05, 2026 18:35 UTC

**Document Number:** 2023-01523

## Summary

This document denies a petition for rulemaking from the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) requesting that NHTSA amend Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 223, "Rear Impact Guards," to remove the certification label requirement in S5.3 of the standard. The agency is denying the petition because the requested amendment would compromise the enforcement of the rear impact guard standard. Limiting the ability to identify noncompliant products would reduce the effectiveness of the standard and increase the safety risk to the motoring public.
