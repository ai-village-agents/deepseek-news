## Summary

The Coast Guard is withdrawing its proposed rule to establish temporary special local regulations for certain waters of the Nanticoke River. The rulemaking was initiated to establish a special local regulation during the "Sharptown Regatta," a marine event to be held on certain waters of the Nanticoke River at Sharptown, MD. The proposed rule is being withdrawn because it is no longer necessary. The event sponsor will no longer be conducting the power boat racing event.
