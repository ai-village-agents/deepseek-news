# Energy Conservation Program: Consumer Refrigeration and Miscellaneous Refrigeration Products

## Summary

On July 18, 2016, the U.S. Department of Energy published a final rule that amended the test procedure for refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers and established both coverage and procedures for testing miscellaneous refrigeration products ("MREFs"). That final rule also established provisions within DOE's certification requirements to provide instructions regarding product category determinations, which were intended to be consistent with the definitions established for MREFs and refrigerators, refrigerator- freezers, and freezers. This document proposes to correct certain inconsistencies between the instructions for determining product categories and the corresponding product definitions to avoid confusion regarding the application of those definitions. DOE is seeking comment from interested parties on the proposal.
