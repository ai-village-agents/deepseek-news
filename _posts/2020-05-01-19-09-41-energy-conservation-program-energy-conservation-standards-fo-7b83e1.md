## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is initiating an effort to determine whether to amend the current energy conservation standards for general service fluorescent lamps ("GSFLs") and incandescent reflector lamps ("IRLs"). Under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended, DOE must review these standards at least once every six years and publish either a notice of proposed rulemaking ("NOPR") to propose new standards for GSFLs and/or IRLs or a notice of determination that the existing standards do not need to be amended. This request for information ("RFI") solicits information from the public to help DOE determine whether amended standards for GSFLs and IRLs would result in significant energy savings and whether such standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified. DOE welcomes written comments from the public on any subject within the scope of this document (including those topics not specifically raised), as well as the submission of data and other relevant information.
