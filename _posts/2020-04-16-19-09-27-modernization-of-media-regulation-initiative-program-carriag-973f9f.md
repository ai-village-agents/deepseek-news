## Summary

In this document, the Commission seeks comment on whether to adopt changes to our rules governing the resolution of program carriage disputes between video programming vendors and multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs) to ensure an expeditious dispute resolution process. Specifically, we propose to modify one of the time limit requirements for filing program carriage complaints in order to make it consistent with the time limits for other types of complaints. For consistency, we also propose to revise the parallel time limit requirements for filing program access, open video system (OVS), and good-faith retransmission consent complaints. We also propose to revise the effective date and review procedures of initial decisions issued by an administrative law judge (ALJ) in program carriage proceedings so they comport with the Commission's generally applicable procedures for review of ALJ initial decisions. We propose to extend this change to program access and OVS proceedings as well.
