## Summary

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing a final rule to define Johnson County, Indiana, as an area of application county to the Hardin-Jefferson, Kentucky, nonappropriated fund (NAF) Federal Wage System (FWS) wage area. This change is necessary because there is one NAF FWS employee working in Johnson County, and the county is not currently defined to a NAF wage area.
