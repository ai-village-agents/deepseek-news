## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the availability of and seeking public comment on a petition received from the Attorneys General of the States of Nebraska, Iowa, Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Montana, North Dakota, South Carolina, and South Dakota requesting the Agency initiate rulemaking to amend the existing regulations under the Federal Insecticide, Rodenticide, and Fungicide Act (FIFRA). The Attorneys General believe the Agency should modify its requirements such that any state labeling requirements inconsistent with EPA's findings and conclusions from its human health risk assessment on human health effects, such as a pesticide's likelihood to cause cancer, birth defects, or reproductive harm, constitute misbranding.
