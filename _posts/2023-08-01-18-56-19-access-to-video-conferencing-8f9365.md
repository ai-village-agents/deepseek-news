## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) revisits the interpretation of a statutory term, interoperable video conferencing service (IVCS). Finding no persuasive reason to modify or limit the scope of the statutory definition of this term, the Commission declines to revise its definition of IVCS, and concludes that its accessibility rules for advanced communications services and equipment apply to all services and equipment that meet the statutory definition of IVCS.
