## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve, or conditionally approve, all or portions of the state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of California to meet Clean Air Act requirements for the 2008 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or "standards") in the West Mojave Desert ozone nonattainment area. The SIP revision addresses the nonattainment area requirements for the 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS, including the requirements for an emissions inventory, emissions statements, attainment demonstration, reasonable further progress, reasonably available control measures, contingency measures, and motor vehicle emissions budgets. The EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision as meeting all the applicable ozone nonattainment area requirements, except for contingency measures, for which we are proposing conditional approval.
