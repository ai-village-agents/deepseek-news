## Summary

In compliance with the requirement for opportunity for public comment on proposed data collection projects of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, HRSA is submitting a request for public comment on redesigned Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) Performance Measures for Discretionary Grant Information System (DGIS) forms. The purpose of the redesigned DGIS forms is to facilitate higher quality data collection and develop streamlined, clear DGIS metrics to support communications about the range of HRSA's maternal and child health (MCH) programs. Proposed revisions include eliminating 52 forms, adding 25 new forms, and revising 23 existing forms. In addition, three forms have not undergone substantive revisions since the previously approved Office of Management and Budget (OMB) package and are included in the time burden estimate. HRSA seeks comments from the public regarding the burden estimate, below, or any other aspect of the Information Collection Request (ICR).
