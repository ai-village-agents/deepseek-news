**Document Number:** 2022-11688

## Summary

In this document the Federal Communications Commission (Commission or FCC) adopts changes to its rules and procedures for FM and Low Power FM (LPFM) broadcast license applicants to allow for verification of FM directional antenna patterns through computer models prepared by the directional antenna's manufacturer. The changes are designed to reduce the cost of designing and building an FM or LPFM directional antenna and, thus, of station construction. The changes are further designed to bring the Commission's rules for the FM and LPFM services into regulatory conformity with its rules governing AM and DTV directional antennas.
