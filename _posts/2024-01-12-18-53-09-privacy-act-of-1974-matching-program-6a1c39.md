## Summary

Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended by the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 and the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Amendments of 1990 (Privacy Act), and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance on the conduct of matching programs, notice is hereby given of the re-establishment of a matching program between the U.S. Department of Education (Department), as the recipient agency, and the Social Security Administration (SSA), as the source agency, to enable the Department to contact individuals whom SSA identifies as disabled using Medical Improvement Not Expected (MINE) data, to inform them that the Department will issue Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) discharges of their balances of loans under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), their title IV HEA loans that have been written off due to default, or, their outstanding service or repayment obligations under the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Program unless they opt out of the TPD discharge. Such TPD discharges will occur no earlier than 61 days from the date that the Department sends the notification to those individuals, unless those individuals choose to have their loans or outstanding service or repayment obligations discharged earlier, or choose to opt out of the TPD discharge within 60 days from the date that the Department sends the notification to them.
