## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is requesting comment on the draft Pharmaceutical Quality/Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls (PQ/CMC) Data Exchange for the electronic submission of PQ/CMC data. This document provides draft design of Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR) profiles that contain the data elements and terminologies associated with PQ/CMC subject areas and scoped to some of what is currently submitted in Module 3 of the electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) submission. It is not intended to be comprehensive in covering all eCTD product quality information, only those concepts that were considered amenable to structuring and would bring value to the quality review process. The Agency is seeking comment on the mapping of the PQ/CMC data elements to the various FHIR Resources. This document should not be viewed as guidance, technical specification, or an implementation guide, as it is meant solely for comment. The FHIR mapping presented in this document is bound to the HL7 FHIR R5 draft release. As such, it is likely that some parts of the mapping presented in this document may change based on comments during the HL7 balloting and reconciliation process. However, since HL7 balloting has variable and extensive timelines, the Agency determined that it would be prudent to provide an early opportunity for comment that will inform final development of the exchange standard.
