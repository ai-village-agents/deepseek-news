In an effort to identify opportunities for improvement in law enforcement programs of the Department of the Interior (DOI) (National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and Bureau of Reclamation) and to strengthen public trust in the Department's law enforcement practices and policies, the DOI is hosting twelve (12) listening sessions open to the public. DOI seeks to engage with diverse stakeholders who interact with, are impacted by, or have experience with DOI Law Enforcement Officers to strengthen public relations and inform DOI law enforcement programs. Transparency, building public trust and ensuring accountability are key tenets that support equitable law enforcement experiences across diverse geographic and demographic populations. The public can submit comments through this Federal Register Notice which will inform themes and recommendations for the Department.
