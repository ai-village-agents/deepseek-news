## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) received a license application by letters dated April 5, 2022, and September 23, 2022, from TRISO-X, LLC (TRISO-X) a wholly owned subsidiary of X-energy LLC. By its application, TRISO-X is requesting a license to possess and use special nuclear material for the manufacture of high-assay low- enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel at a fuel fabrication facility (FFF) to be located in Oak Ridge, Roane County, Tennessee. The proposed action is the issuance of a license for the possession and use of special nuclear material. The NRC staff will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) to document the potential environmental impacts from the proposed action. As part of the EIS development process, the NRC is seeking comments on the scope of its environmental review.
