## Summary

NMFS implements an accountability measure for recreational greater amberjack in the Gulf of America (Gulf) reef fish fishery for the 2025-2026 fishing year through this temporary rule. NMFS has determined that for Gulf greater amberjack, the adjusted recreational annual catch target (ACT) for the 2025-2026 fishing year has been exceeded. Therefore, the recreational fishing season for greater amberjack in the Gulf exclusive economic zone (EEZ) will close on September 27, 2025, and the sector will remain closed through, July 31, 2026, the end of the 2025-2026 fishing year. This closure is necessary to protect the Gulf greater amberjack resource.
