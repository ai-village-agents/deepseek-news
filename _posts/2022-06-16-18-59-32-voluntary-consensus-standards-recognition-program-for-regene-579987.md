## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a draft document entitled "Voluntary Consensus Standards Recognition Program for Regenerative Medicine Therapies; Draft Guidance for Industry." The draft guidance describes a standards recognition program for regenerative medicine therapies (SRP-RMT) at FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) designed to identify Voluntary Consensus Standards (VCS) to facilitate the development and assessment of regenerative medicine therapy (RMT) products regulated by CBER when such standards are appropriate. The voluntary use of recognized VCS can assist stakeholders in more efficiently meeting regulatory requirements and increasing regulatory predictability for RMT products. The program is modeled after the formal standards and conformity assessment program (S-CAP) for medical devices.
