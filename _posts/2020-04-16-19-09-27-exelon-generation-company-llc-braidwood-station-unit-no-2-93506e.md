## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering issuance of an amendment to Renewed Facility Operating License No. NPF- 77, issued to Exelon Generation Company, LLC, for operation of the Braidwood Station, Unit No. 2. The proposed amendment would provide a one-time extension of steam generator tube inspections to allow the inspections to be conducted after three operating cycles instead of after the current required two operating cycles. The amendment is necessary to avoid conflicts with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations regarding social distancing to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The amendment also avoids a possible scenario in which expertise required to conduct the inspections is lost because of COVID-19 infections.
