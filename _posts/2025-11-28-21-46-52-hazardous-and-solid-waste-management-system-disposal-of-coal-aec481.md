## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) is proposing to extend, by three years, one compliance deadline applicable to certain coal combustion residuals (CCR) surface impoundments operating pursuant to the alternative closure requirements. Specifically, EPA is extending the deadline for owners and operators to complete closure of their unlined CCR surface impoundments larger than 40 acres from October 17, 2028, to October 17, 2031. This deadline extension will promote electric grid reliability by allowing a subset of coal-fired power producers to continue to operate beyond their currently scheduled retirement date.
