## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Honda Aircraft Company LLC (Honda) Model HA-420 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of tool damage to multiple locations on the interior fuselage skin fiber and the omission of certain service material from the Airworthiness Limitations Section (ALS) of the maintenance manual. This proposed AD would require incorporating certain material into the ALS of the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
