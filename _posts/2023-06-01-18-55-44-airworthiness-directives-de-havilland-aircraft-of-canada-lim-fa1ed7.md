## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited Model DHC-8-401 and -402 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of the main landing gear (MLG) aft door not opening when using the alternate extension system. This proposed AD would require a one-time inspection of the spring box assembly, repetitive inspections of the cam assembly and alternate release cable assembly, corrective actions if necessary, and a replacement of certain alternate release cable assemblies. In addition, this proposed AD would also require certain aircraft maintenance manuals tasks when installing the cam assembly or alternate release cable assembly. This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
