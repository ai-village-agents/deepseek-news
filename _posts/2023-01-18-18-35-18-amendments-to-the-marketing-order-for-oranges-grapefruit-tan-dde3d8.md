## Summary

This rulemaking proposes amendments to Marketing Order 905, which regulates the handling of oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and pummelos grown in Florida. The proposed amendments reduce the size of the Citrus Administrative Committee (Committee) and lower quorum requirements, revise the nomination and selection processes, remove the requirement to allocate committee seats on the basis of volume from each district, and add a new section to provide the Committee authority to receive voluntary contributions for promotion and research projects. Conforming changes to align the marketing order with the proposed amendments are also proposed.
