## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve revisions to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the State of Missouri. This final action will amend the SIP to incorporate revisions to a state regulation related to the reporting of start-up, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) events in Missouri. The revisions to this rule include adding incorporations by reference to other state rules, including definitions specific to the rule and making administrative wording changes. These revisions meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act, do not impact the stringency of the SIP or air quality. Approval of these revisions will ensure consistency between state and federally approved rules.
