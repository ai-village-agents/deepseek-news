## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2025-06-04, which applies to all Airbus Helicopters Model AS350B, AS350B1, AS350B2, AS350B3, AS350BA, AS350D, AS355E, AS355F, AS355F1, AS355F2, AS355N, AS355NP, EC130B4, and EC130T2 helicopters. AD 2025-06-04 requires repetitively inspecting the main gearbox (MGB) bevel wheel and the MGB magnetic plug for particles and performing corrective actions if applicable and prohibits installing an affected MGB unless certain requirements are met. Since the FAA issued AD 2025-06-04, the FAA determined that AD 2025-06-04 contains errors in the interval compliance times. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions of AD 2025-06-04 and revise the interval compliance times. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
