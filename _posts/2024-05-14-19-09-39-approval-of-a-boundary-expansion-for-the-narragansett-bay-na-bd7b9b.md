## Summary

In accordance with the Coastal Zone Management Act and its implementing regulations, notice is hereby given that NOAA's Office for Coastal Management approves a 103-acre, one parcel boundary expansion for the Narragansett Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve in Prudence Island, Rhode Island. Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act, NOAA prepared a draft environmental assessment (draft EA) to analyze the effects of the requested expansion and solicited public comment on the draft EA. NOAA determined that the boundary expansion would not have significant environmental effects. Therefore, after considering the comments it received, NOAA issued a final environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact (FONSI).
