## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-2B16 (604 Variant) airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that a combination of system faults and procedural actions will cause the ground spoilers to deploy in the air. This AD requires revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to add revised procedures. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
