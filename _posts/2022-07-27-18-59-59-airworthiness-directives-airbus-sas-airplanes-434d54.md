## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, - 113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, - 131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that cracks were found on the web horizontal flange and inner cap on a certain frame (FR), left-hand (LH) and right-hand (RH) sides, at a certain stringer (STGR). This AD requires repetitive high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections for cracks on the web horizontal flange and inner cap, and applicable corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
