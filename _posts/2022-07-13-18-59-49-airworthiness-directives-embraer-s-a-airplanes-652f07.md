## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Embraer S.A. Model EMB-545 and EMB-550 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that there is a possibility of the shoulder belt getting stuck during flight due to a step between the divan shroud chamfer and the sideledge panel. This proposed AD would require installing, on the right- and left-hand side divan, a protective fairing covering on the divan shroud and the sideledge panel, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
