## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled "M11 Clinical Electronic Structured Harmonised Protocol (CeSHarP)," and two supplemental documents entitled "M11 Template," and "M11 Technical Specification." The draft guidance, template, and technical specification were prepared under the auspices of the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), formerly the International Conference on Harmonisation. The draft guidance provides recommendations for a harmonized clinical trial protocol including the organization of standardized content and formatting. The draft template identifies headers, common text, and a set of data fields and terminologies that will be the basis for efficiencies in data exchange. The technical specification recommends the use of an open, non-proprietary standard to enable electronic exchange of clinical protocol information. The intent of the draft guidance and supporting documents is to create an international standard for the content and exchange of clinical trial protocol information facilitating review and assessment by regulators, sponsors, ethical oversight bodies, investigators, and other stakeholders.
