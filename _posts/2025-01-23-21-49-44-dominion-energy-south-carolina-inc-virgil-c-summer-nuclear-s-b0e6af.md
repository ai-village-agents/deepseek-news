## Summary

On December 6, 2024, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) solicited public comments on draft Supplement 15, Second Renewal, to the Generic Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS) for License Renewal of Nuclear Plants, NUREG-1437, regarding the subsequent renewal of Renewed Facility Operating License No. NPF-12 for an additional 20 years for Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Station, Unit 1 (V.C. Summer). The public comment period closed on January 21, 2025. The NRC has rescheduled the in-person public meeting to receive comments on the document and is therefore reopening the public comment period to allow more time for members of the public to submit their comments.
