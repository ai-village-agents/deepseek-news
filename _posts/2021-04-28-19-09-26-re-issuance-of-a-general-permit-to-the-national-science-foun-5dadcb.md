## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to re-issue a general permit under the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) authorizing the National Science Foundation (NSF) to dispose of ice piers in ocean waters. Permit re- issuance is necessary because the current permit is due to expire on May 21, 2021. EPA does not propose substantive changes to the content of the current permit.
