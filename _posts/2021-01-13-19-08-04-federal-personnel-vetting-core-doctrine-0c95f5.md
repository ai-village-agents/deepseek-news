## Summary

This action by the Acting OPM Director in the capacity as the Suitability and Credentialing Executive Agent, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) in the capacity as the Security Executive Agent, establishes a Federal Personnel Vetting Core Doctrine to guide transformative efforts to reform the U.S. Government personnel security vetting processes. This policy statement is consistent with direction established by the President in an Executive order entitled Reforming Processes Related to Suitability for Government Employment, Fitness for Contractor Employees, and Eligibility for Access to Classified National Security Information, mandating the Executive Agents to align, to the greatest extent practicable, the Federal workforce vetting processes to promote mobility, improve efficiencies and move towards an enhanced risk management approach. With the issuance of this general statement of policy, the Federal Personnel Vetting Core Doctrine establishes the philosophy for the Government's personnel vetting program and will guide development of Government-wide and agency policy. This Core Doctrine defines the personnel vetting mission, its guiding principles, key supporting processes, and policy priorities.
