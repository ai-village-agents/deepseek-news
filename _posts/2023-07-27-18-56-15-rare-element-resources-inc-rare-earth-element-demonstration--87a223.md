## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) and accompanying Environmental Assessment (EA) for an application request from Rare Element Resources, Inc. (RER) for a source materials license accompanying the construction and operation of a rare earth element (REE) separation and processing demonstration plant near Upton, Wyoming. Based on the analysis in the EA, the NRC staff has concluded that there would be no significant impacts to environmental resources from RER's proposed facility and, therefore, a FONSI is appropriate.
