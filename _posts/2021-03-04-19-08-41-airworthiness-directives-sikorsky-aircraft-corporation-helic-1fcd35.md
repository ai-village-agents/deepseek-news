## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (Sikorsky) Model S-92A helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by an incident of a side facing utility seat detaching from wall attachment points. This proposed AD would require modifying certain side facing utility seats and observer seats. This proposed AD would also prohibit installing those seats unless the modification has been accomplished. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
