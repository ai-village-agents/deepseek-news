## Summary

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) received a request from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for authorization to take a small number of northern sea otters by harassment incidental to a marine geophysical survey in the northeast Pacific Ocean. Pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended (MMPA), the Service is requesting comments on its proposal to issue an incidental harassment authorization (IHA) to NSF for certain activities during the period between May 1 and June 30, 2021. This proposed IHA, if finalized, will be for take by Level A and Level B harassment. We anticipate no take by death and include none in this proposed authorization. The Service has prepared a draft environmental assessment (EA) addressing the proposed IHA and is soliciting public comments on both documents.
