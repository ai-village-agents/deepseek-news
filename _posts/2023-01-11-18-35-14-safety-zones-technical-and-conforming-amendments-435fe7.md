# Safety Zones; Technical and Conforming Amendments

## Summary

This final rule makes non-substantive technical and conforming amendments to a Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part which will allow the Coast Guard to include safety zones for non-mineral energy resource facilities on the Outer Continental Shelf in that part. It reflects amendments to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act by the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. This rule will have no substantive effect on the regulated public. It enables us to properly place newly authorized safety zones in the same CFR part where other existing Outer Continental Shelf safety zone regulations are located.
