## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Safran Helicopter Engines, S.A. (Safran) Makila 1A and Makila 1A1 model turboshaft engines. This AD was prompted by reports of false engine fire warnings. This AD requires replacing the affected fire detectors, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also prohibits the installation of affected fire detectors. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
