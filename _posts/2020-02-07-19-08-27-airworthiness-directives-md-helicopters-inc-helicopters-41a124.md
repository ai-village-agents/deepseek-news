## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for MD Helicopters Inc., (MDHI) Model 369D, 369E, 369FF, 369H, 369HE, 369HM, 369HS, 500N, and 600N helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of non-conforming main rotor (M/R) hub lead-lag bolts (bolts). This proposed AD would require removing certain bolts from service. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
