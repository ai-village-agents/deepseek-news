## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Embraer S.A. Model ERJ 170-100 STD, -100 LR, -100 SU, and -100 SE; ERJ 170-200 STD, -200 LR, -200 SU; ERJ 190-100 STD, -100 LR, -100 IGW, and -100 ECJ; and ERJ 190-200 STD, -200 LR, and -200 IGW airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of the failure of the inner pane of certain passenger windows to meet maximum operating pressure and lack of fail- safe design. This AD requires determining if certain NORDAM passenger windows are installed, and performing corrective actions if any affected part is installed. This AD also prohibits the installation of affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
