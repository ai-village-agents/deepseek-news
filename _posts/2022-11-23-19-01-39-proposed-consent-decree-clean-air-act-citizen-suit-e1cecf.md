In accordance with the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA or the Act), EPA is providing notice of a proposed consent decree in Comit[eacute] Progreso de Lamont, et al. v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, et al., No. 3:21-cv-08733-WHA (N.D. Cal.). On November 10, 2021, Plaintiffs Comit[eacute] Progreso de Lamont, Committee for a Better Arvin, Committee for a Better Shafter, Central California Environmental Justice Network, Association of Irritated Residents, Medical Advocates for Healthy Air, National Parks Conservation Association, and Sierra Club filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Plaintiffs alleged that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) failed to perform certain non-discretionary duties in accordance with the Act. These duties pertain to promulgation of a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for the San Joaquin Valley area of California to address certain remaining nonattainment plan requirements for the 1997, 2006, and 2012 PM<INF>2.5</INF> national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). The proposed consent decree would establish deadlines for EPA to sign notices of proposed and final actions.
