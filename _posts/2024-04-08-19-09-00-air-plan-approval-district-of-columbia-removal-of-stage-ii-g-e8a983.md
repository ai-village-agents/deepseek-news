## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the District of Columbia. This SIP revision removes requirements for gasoline vapor recovery systems (VRS) installed on gasoline dispensers, the purpose of which are to capture emissions from vehicle refueling operations, otherwise known as vacuum-assist Stage II vapor recovery. Specifically, this action would remove from the approved SIP the prior-approved Stage II requirements applicable to new and existing gasoline dispensing facilities (GDFs). The District of Columbia SIP revision includes a demonstration that removal of Stage II requirements is consistent with the Clean Air Act (CAA) and meets all relevant EPA guidance.
