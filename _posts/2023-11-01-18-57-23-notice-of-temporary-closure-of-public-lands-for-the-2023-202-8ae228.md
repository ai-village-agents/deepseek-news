## Summary

The Las Vegas Field Office announces the temporary closures of certain public lands under its administration in Clark County, NV. These temporary closures are being made in the interest of public safety for the SNORE 250, Mint 400, and Legacy Battleground Off-Highway Vehicle (OHV) races in the Jean/Roach Dry Lakes Special Recreation Management Area (SRMA). The events will individually take place for one-day and two-day periods between the months of December to March from 2023 through 2027. The temporary closures are needed to limit access to the race area and minimize the risk of potential collisions with spectators and racers during the events.
