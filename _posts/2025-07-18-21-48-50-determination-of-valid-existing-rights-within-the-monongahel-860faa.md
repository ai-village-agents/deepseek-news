## Summary

This notice announces our decision on a request for a determination of valid existing rights (VER) under section 522(e) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). We have determined that South Fork Coal Company, LLC (SFCC) possesses VER for a haul road within the boundaries of the Monongahela National Forest (MNF), West Virginia. This decision will allow SFCC to maintain a West Virginia surface coal mining and reclamation permit for the road in question and to use the road to access and haul coal from a surface mine located on adjacent private lands.
