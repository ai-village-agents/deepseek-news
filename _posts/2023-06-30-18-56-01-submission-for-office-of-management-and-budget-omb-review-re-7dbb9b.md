## Summary

The Office of Head Start (OHS), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, requests public comment on an extension with changes to recordkeeping requirements for ACF Head Start grant recipients. A Final Rule published on January 6, 2023, added a recordkeeping requirement that Head Start grant recipients update their program policies and procedures to include an evidence-based COVID-19 mitigation policy. OHS requested and received emergency approval from OMB to implement the updated recordkeeping requirement as required in the Final Rule. Approval was for 6 months. Subsequently, a final rule was published on June 26, 2023, which removed all previously approved vaccination recordkeeping requirements and the requirement to maintain a testing protocol. This request is to remove these requirements from the information collection and extend approval of the remaining recordkeeping requirement under this OMB number for an additional 3 years.
