## Summary

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) has procedures for establishing supervisory authority over a nonbank covered person based on a risk determination, which the Bureau recently amended in April 2022 (Updated Procedural Rule). The Updated Procedural Rule added a new process to the procedures, for the Bureau to consider making final decisions and orders in these proceedings public, in whole or in part. While the Bureau strongly believes in supervisory confidentiality, these particular decisions and orders present unique circumstances that implicate important public interests in transparency. The Updated Procedural Rule did not affect the confidentiality of supervisory examinations or other aspects of the supervisory process. The Bureau is making specific changes to that rule in response to comments, in order to clarify the standard that will govern whether a decision or order will be publicly released, as well as to give respondents in proceedings additional time to provide input on that issue.
