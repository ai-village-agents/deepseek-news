## Summary

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA), as amended, prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer equipment and certain commercial and industrial equipment, including commercial packaged boilers (CPBs). EPCA also requires the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to periodically review standards. In this final rule, DOE is adopting more-stringent energy conservation standards for certain commercial packaged boilers.
