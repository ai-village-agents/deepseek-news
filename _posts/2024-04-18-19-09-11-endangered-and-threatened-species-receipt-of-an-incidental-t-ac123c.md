We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce that we are extending the comment period for the public to review a draft habitat conservation plan (HCP) and a draft environmental action statement and low-effect screening form. These documents are associated with the Colton/San Bernardino Regional Tertiary Treatment and Water Reclamation Authority and San Bernardino Municipal Water Department's application under the Endangered Species Act for a permit associated with incidental take of the Santa Ana sucker (Catostomus santaanae).
