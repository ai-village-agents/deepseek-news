## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FMCSA announces its plan to submit the Information Collection Request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review and approval and invites public comment. This ICR will enable FMCSA to document the burden associated with the marking regulations, "Marking of Self-Propelled CMVs and Intermodal Equipment." These regulations require marking of vehicles and intermodal equipment by motor carriers, freight forwarders, and intermodal equipment providers (IEPs) engaging in interstate transportation and motor carriers that transport hazardous materials (HM) in intrastate transportation.
