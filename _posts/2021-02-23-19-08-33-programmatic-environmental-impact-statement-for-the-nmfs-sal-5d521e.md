## Summary

NOAA announces its intent to prepare a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) for the implementation of projects that foster the promotion, marketing, research, and development of U.S. Fisheries and their associated fishing sectors, as consistent with NOAA's Saltonstall-Kennedy Research and Development Program (S-K Program). The focus of this action will be activities and projects under the S-K Program, which interfaces with numerous programs within NOAA, and it is NOAA's intention that this PEIS may also cover those activities and projects implemented by other NOAA programs and offices that are consistent with the scope of the S-K Program. The S-K Program funds projects that address the needs of fishing communities, optimize economic benefits by building and maintaining sustainable fisheries (where the term "fisheries" includes commercial wild capture, recreational fishing, cultural and subsistence fishing, and marine aquaculture), and increase other opportunities to keep working waterfronts viable. This notice of intent (NOI) to prepare a PEIS initiates the public scoping process and invites interested parties to provide comments on the proposed project, its potential to affect the human environment, means for avoiding, minimizing, or mitigating those effects, the preliminary range of alternatives, and any additional reasonable alternatives that should be considered.
