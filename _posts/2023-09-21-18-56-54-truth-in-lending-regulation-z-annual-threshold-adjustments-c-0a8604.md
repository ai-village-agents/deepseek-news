## Summary

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau or CFPB) is issuing this final rule amending the regulation text and official interpretations for Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). The CFPB calculates the dollar amounts for several provisions in Regulation Z annually; this final rule revises, as applicable, the dollar amounts for provisions implementing TILA and amendments to TILA, including under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994 (HOEPA), and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). The CFPB is adjusting these amounts, where appropriate, based on the annual percentage change reflected in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in effect on June 1, 2023.
