## Summary

This action finalizes the results of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) review of the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for Lead Acid Battery Manufacturing Plants and the technology review for the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Lead Acid Battery Manufacturing Area Sources as required under the Clean Air Act (CAA). The EPA is finalizing revised lead emission limits for grid casting, paste mixing, and lead reclamation operations for both the area source NESHAP and under a new NSPS subpart (for lead acid battery manufacturing facilities that begin construction, reconstruction, or modification after February 23, 2022). In addition, the EPA is finalizing the following amendments for both the area source NESHAP and under the new NSPS subpart: performance testing once every 5 years to demonstrate compliance; work practices to minimize emissions of fugitive lead dust; increased inspection frequency of fabric filters; clarification of activities that are considered to be lead reclamation activities; electronic reporting of performance test results and semiannual compliance reports; and the removal of exemptions for periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunctions (SSM). The EPA is also finalizing a revision to the applicability provisions in the area source NESHAP such that facilities which make lead-bearing battery parts or process input material, including but not limited to grid casting facilities and lead oxide manufacturing facilities, will be subject to the area source NESHAP. In addition, the EPA is finalizing a requirement in the new NSPS for new facilities to operate bag leak detection systems for emission points controlled by a fabric filter that do not include a secondary fabric filter.
