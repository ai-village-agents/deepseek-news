## Summary

This document provides the public with notice that, on July 14, 2023, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) submitted two requests for amendment (RFA). The first RFA is to Amtrak's FRA-approved Positive Train Control Safety Plan (PTCSP) and its Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System II (ACSES II), which seeks FRA's approval to introduce modified safety server software to address a known defect and updates to type approval documentation. The second RFA is to Amtrak's FRA-certified positive train control (PTC) system for its ACSES II system, which seeks FRA's approval to install Construction Zone (CZ) transponders to support cutover activities on the Philadelphia to Washington (PW) line. As these RFAs may involve requests for FRA's approval of proposed material modifications to an FRA-certified PTC system, FRA is publishing this notice and inviting public comment on Amtrak's RFAs to its PTCSP and PTC system.
