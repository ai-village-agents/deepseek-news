## Summary

The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is providing an additional 60 days for public comments on the proposed rule that would amend the Lamb Promotion, Research, and Information Order (Order). During the February 22, 2021, through March 24, 2021, comment period, AMS received two comments requesting additional time to analyze a potential volume threshold that would allow low-volume market agencies to be eligible for flexibilities to the proposed assessment remittance process. Such flexibilities would allow for very small, low-volume market agencies to utilize quarterly or yearly remittances, as opposed to the proposed monthly remittance process. The proposed flexibilities would reduce the regulatory burden for affected market agencies.
