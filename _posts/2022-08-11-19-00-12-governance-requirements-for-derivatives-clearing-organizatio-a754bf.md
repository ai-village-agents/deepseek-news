## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC or Commission) is proposing amendments to require derivatives clearing organizations (DCOs) to establish and consult with one or more risk management committees (RMCs) comprised of clearing members and customers of clearing members on matters that could materially affect the risk profile of the DCO. In addition, the Commission proposes establishing minimum requirements for RMC composition and rotation, and requiring DCOs to establish and enforce fitness standards for RMC members. The Commission also proposes requiring DCOs to maintain written policies and procedures governing the RMC consultation process and the role of RMC members. Finally, the Commission is proposing to require DCOs to establish one or more market participant risk advisory working groups (RWGs) that must convene at least quarterly, and adopt written policies and procedures related to the formation and role of the RWG.
