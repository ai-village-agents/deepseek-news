## Summary

On January 21, 2022, NOAA requested written comments to facilitate the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries' (ONMS) five-year review of the nomination for a proposed Mariana Trench National Marine Sanctuary (NMS). On March 10, 2022, NOAA reopened the public comment period for an additional 45 days, ending on April 25, 2022. In those notices, NOAA requested relevant information as it pertains to its 11 evaluation criteria for inclusion in the inventory of sites eligible to be considered for designation as national marine sanctuaries. NOAA has synthesized the information gathered through the public process, completed an internal analysis, and the ONMS Director has made the determination that the Mariana Trench NMS nomination will be removed from the inventory.
