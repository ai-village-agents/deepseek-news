## Summary

This notice announces EPA's order for the cancellations and/or amendments to terminate uses, voluntarily requested by the registrants and accepted by the Agency, pursuant to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). This cancellation order follows an August 05, 2025, Federal Register Notice of Receipt of Requests from the registrants listed in Table 3 of Unit II, to voluntarily cancel and/or amend to terminate uses of these product registrations. In the August 05, 2025, notice, EPA indicated that it would issue an order implementing the cancellations and/or amendments to terminate uses, unless the Agency received substantive comments within the 30-day comment period that would merit its further review of these requests, or unless the registrants withdrew their requests. The Agency did not receive any comments on the notice. One registrant, the registrant of 7969-33, withdrew their request. Therefore, it has been removed from this notice. Accordingly, EPA hereby issues this notice a cancellation order granting the requested cancellations and/or amendments to terminate uses. Any distribution, sale, or use of the products subject to this cancellation order is permitted only in accordance with the terms of this order, including any existing stocks provisions.
