## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce the reopening of the public comment period on our October 9, 2018, proposed rule to list the black-capped petrel (Pterodroma hasitata) as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), with a rule issued under section 4(d) of the Act to provide for the conservation of this species. We are reopening the comment period to present significant new information we have received since 2018 that is relevant to our consideration of the status of the black-capped petrel and allow interested parties to comment. Comments submitted during the 2018 comment period do not need to be resubmitted and will be fully considered in preparation of our final rule. We encourage those who may have commented previously to submit additional comments, if appropriate, in light of this new information.
