## Summary

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is finalizing the 2004 interim final rule (IFR) that established the Flight Training Security Program (FTSP) (formerly known as the Alien Flight Student Program). The FTSP implements a statutory requirement under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, as amended by the Vision 100- Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act, to prevent flight schools from providing flight training to any individuals who are not U.S. citizens or nationals, and who have not been vetted by the Federal Government to determine whether the flight training candidate is a security threat. The rule also requires security awareness training for certain flight training provider employees. In finalizing this rule, TSA addresses the comments on the IFR, recommendations from the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, and additional comments received during a reopened comment period. TSA also is eliminating years of programmatic guidance and clarifications by codifying current and relevant information into the regulatory text. Where possible, TSA is modifying the program to make it more effective and less burdensome. Finally, TSA is making other technical modifications to its regulations to consolidate in one location the agency's inspection authority.
