## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce a 12-month finding on a petition to list the Sonoran desert tortoise (Gopherus morafkai) as an endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). After a thorough review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that it is not warranted at this time to list the Sonoran desert tortoise. However, we ask the public to submit to us at any time any new information relevant to the status of the Sonoran desert tortoise or its habitat.
