## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-06-07, which applies to all The Boeing Company Model 757-200, - 200CB, and -300 series airplanes. AD 2018-06-07 requires inspecting the fuselage frame at a certain station for existing repairs, repetitive inspections, and applicable repairs. Since the FAA issued AD 2018-06- 07, the agency has received reports of new crack findings outside of the AD 2018-06-07 inspection area, which the current inspections will not detect. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2018-06-07, with an expanded inspection area, additional inspections, a modified inspection type, and applicable repairs. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
