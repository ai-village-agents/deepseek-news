## Summary

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF), within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), oversees the Home Visiting Evidence of Effectiveness (HomVEE) review, which is proposing to revise the procedures and standards that guide its work with single- case design (SCD) research. The current Federal Register notice (FRN) seeks comments on proposed changes related to revised procedures and standards for SCD research. Readers are referred to the full version of the HomVEE Version 2 Handbook on the HomVEE website for more details, particularly Appendix D (https://homvee.acf.hhs.gov/publications/ methods-standards). HomVEE will release an updated Handbook (Version 2.1) after consideration of public comments received in response to this FRN.
