# Ownership and Control and Contractual Assistance Requirement for the 8(a) Business Development Program; Correction

**Published:** February 05, 2026 19:08 UTC

## Summary

This document corrects a technical error in the definition of substantial bundling that appeared in the Federal Register on April 27, 2023, a final rule entitled, "Ownership and Control and Contractual Assistance Requirements for the 8(a) Business Development Program." The definition of substantial bundling, as it relates to Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs), improperly limited substantial bundling to BPAs entered against a U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule Contract. This notice removes that limitation so that the definition of substantial bundling applies to all BPAs and not only BPAs entered against GSA Schedule Contracts.
