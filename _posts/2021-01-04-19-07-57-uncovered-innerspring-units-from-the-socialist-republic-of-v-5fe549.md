## Summary

The Department of Commerce (Commerce) has completed the administrative review of the antidumping duty order on uncovered innerspring units (innersprings) from the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (Vietnam) covering the period of review (POR) December 1, 2018 through November 30, 2019. We continue to find that Angkor Spring Co., Ltd. (Angkor Spring) did not demonstrate eligibility for a separate rate; therefore, it is part of the Vietnam-wide entity.
