## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to authorize the Amtrak Railroad Bridge, mile 3.77, across the South Branch of the Chicago River, to be operated remotely and establish an intermediate opening position. The request was made by the bridge owner. This proposed rule will improve vessel flow through the river. This proposed rule will not change the operating schedule of the bridge.
