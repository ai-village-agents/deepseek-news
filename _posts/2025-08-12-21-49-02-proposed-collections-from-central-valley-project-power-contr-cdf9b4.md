## Summary

The Sierra Nevada (SN) region of the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) proposes unchanged procedures for the Collection of Restoration Fund payments from the Central Valley Project (CVP) Power Contractors. These collection procedures supersede those previously published in the Federal Register on April 16, 2003 (68 FR 18621). The collection procedures remain unchanged but are being republished, for administrative purposes, to remove references to a specific WAPA-SN Power Marketing Plan (PMP).
