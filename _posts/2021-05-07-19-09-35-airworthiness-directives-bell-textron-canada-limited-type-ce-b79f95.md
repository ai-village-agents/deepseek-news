## Summary

The FAA is revising a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that applied to certain Bell Helicopter Textron Canada Limited (now Bell Textron Canada Limited) Model 206A, 206B, 206L, 206L-1, 206L-3, and 206L-4 helicopters. This action revises the NPRM by revising the format, rearranging certain paragraphs, converting a certain table to paragraph format, and removing certain language. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive (AD) to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since the NPRM was issued, a significant amount of time has elapsed requiring the FAA to reopen the comment period to allow the public a chance to comment on the proposed actions.
