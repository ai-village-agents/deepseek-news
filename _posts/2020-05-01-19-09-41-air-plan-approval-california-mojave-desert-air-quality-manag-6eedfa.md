## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve revisions to the Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District (MDAQMD) portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from organic liquid and gasoline transfer and storage operations. We are approving local rules that regulate these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act). We are also converting the conditional approval of the MDAQMD's reasonably available control technology (RACT) SIPs for the 1997 and 2008 ozone standards, as it applies to these rules, to a full approval.
