## Summary

In this final rule, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to implement the rescission of Sudan's designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism (SSOT). The Secretary of State rescinded this designation effective December 14, 2020 in accordance with established statutory procedures, including the President's October 26, 2020 submission to Congress of a report justifying the rescission and certifying Sudan had not provided any support for acts of international terrorism during the preceding six month period and that Sudan had provided assurances that it would not support acts of international terrorism in the future. Accordingly, BIS amends the EAR by removing Anti-Terrorism (AT) controls on the country and by removing Sudan from Country Group E:1 (Terrorist supporting countries). These actions render the country eligible for a general 25 percent de minimis level. As a consequence of these actions, as well as the addition of the country to Country Group B, Sudan is also potentially eligible for several new license exceptions under the EAR. However, pursuant to this rule, two license exceptions will be unavailable for exports and reexports to Sudan. BIS also makes conforming amendments in other applicable EAR provisions as part of this rule.
