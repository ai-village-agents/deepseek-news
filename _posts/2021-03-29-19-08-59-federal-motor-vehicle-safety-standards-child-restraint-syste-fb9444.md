# Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Child Restraint Systems; Denial of Petition for Rulemaking

**Published:** February 05, 2026 19:08 UTC

## Summary

This document denies a petition for rulemaking from Jewkes Biomechanics (Jewkes) requesting that NHTSA amend Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 213, "Child restraint systems," to remove a requirement that child restraint systems (CRSs) must meet performance requirements without use of a top tether, or exclude from that requirement a new kind of CRS that the petitioner would like to develop called a "hybrid CRS." Alternatively, the petitioner requests that the definition of a "harness" in FMVSS No. 213 be amended to include its hybrid CRS. NHTSA is denying the petition because the requested amendments would unreasonably reduce the child occupant protection provided by FMVSS No. 213.
