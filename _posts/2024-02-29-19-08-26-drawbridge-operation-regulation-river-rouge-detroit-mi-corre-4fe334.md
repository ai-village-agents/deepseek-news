## Summary

The Coast Guard is correcting regulations that published in the Federal Register on December 28, 2023. The final rule announced changes to the operations of all movable bridges over the River Rouge, Detroit, MI, to improve communications and establish winter hours. This correction fixes incorrect language in the regulations. The language in the final rule inadvertently stated the draw of the Dix Avenue Bridge, mile 2.73, is remotely operated, when it is not equipped or authorized to operate remotely.
