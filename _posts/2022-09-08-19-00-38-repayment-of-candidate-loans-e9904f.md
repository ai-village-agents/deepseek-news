## Summary

The Federal Election Commission ("Commission") is removing regulatory restrictions on authorized committees' repayment of candidate personal loans. The Commission is taking this action in light of the Supreme Court's recent decision in Federal Election Commission v. Ted Cruz for Senate, which held that the statutory provision implemented by those regulations is unconstitutional. The Commission is accepting comments on these revisions to its regulations.
