## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), announce that we are extending the public comment period for a draft supplemental environmental impact statement (draft supplemental EIS) to consider the effects of a potential land exchange of certain lands owned by the King Cove Corporation with certain lands owned by the U.S. Government and located within the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge and Izembek Wilderness Area. If a land exchange is approved, King Cove Corporation would use the acquired land for a road corridor for noncommercial use. We invite comment on the draft supplemental EIS from the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies. Comments previously submitted need not be resubmitted, as they will be fully considered.
