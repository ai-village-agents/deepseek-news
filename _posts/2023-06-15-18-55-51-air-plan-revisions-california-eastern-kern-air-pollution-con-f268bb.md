## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing a limited approval and limited disapproval of a revision to the Eastern Kern Air Pollution Control District (EKAPCD) portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). This revision concerns emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) from stationary gas turbines. Under the authority of the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), this action simultaneously approves a local rule that regulates these emission sources and identifies deficiencies with the rule that must be corrected for the EPA to grant full approval of the rule.
