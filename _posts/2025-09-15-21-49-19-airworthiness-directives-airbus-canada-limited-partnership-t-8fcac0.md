# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Canada Limited Partnership (Type Certificate Previously Held by C Series Aircraft Limited Partnership (CSALP); Bombardier, Inc.) Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD- 500-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of certain fuel transfer float valves failing in the closed position, preventing normal fuel transfer between the center and wing fuel tanks. This proposed AD would require replacing the existing fuel transfer float valves on airplanes that are approved for extended-range twin-engine operation performance standards (ETOPS). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
