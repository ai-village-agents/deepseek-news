## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled "S5(R3) Detection of Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity for Human Pharmaceuticals." The guidance was prepared under the auspices of the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), formerly the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. The guidance provides key considerations for developing a testing strategy to identify hazard and characterize reproductive risk for human pharmaceuticals. The guidance is intended to align with other ICH guidances, elaborate on concepts to consider when designing studies, and identify potential circumstances in which a risk assessment can be made based on preliminary studies. It also clarifies the qualification and potential use of alternative assays. This guidance finalizes the draft guidance issued on November 13, 2017.
