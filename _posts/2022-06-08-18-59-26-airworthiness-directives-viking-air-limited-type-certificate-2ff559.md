## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Viking Air Limited (type certificate previously held by Bombardier Inc. and de Havilland, Inc.) Model DHC-6-1, DHC-6-100, DHC- 6-200, DHC-6-300, and DHC-6-400 airplanes. This AD was prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as binding of the rod end bearing connecting the lower fuel control unit (FCU) push rod assembly to the FCU power lever. This AD requires performing tests, inspections, and lubrication of the FCU push rod assemblies, and replacing them with improved parts as necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
