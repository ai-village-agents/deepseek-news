## Summary

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) extends the duration of the NIST Consortium for the Advancement of Genome Editing (Genome Editing Consortium or Consortium) to December 1, 2025. NIST will now accept letters of interest to participate in this Consortium on an ongoing basis. The Consortium duration was originally through December 1, 2020, and the deadline for letters of interest was originally January 1, 2020. NIST is taking this action to provide additional time for interested parties to join the Consortium and to ensure the successful implementation and achievement of outcomes of the current Consortium activities, as well as to address additional standards needs as defined by the Consortium.
