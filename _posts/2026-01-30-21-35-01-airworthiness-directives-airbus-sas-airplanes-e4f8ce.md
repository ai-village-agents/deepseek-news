## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2024-24-10, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A318 and Model A320 series airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, - 132, -133, -151N, -153N, and 171N airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, -232, -251N, -251NX, -252N, -252NX, - 253N, -253NX, -271N, -271NX, -272N, and -272NX airplanes. AD 2024-24-10 requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2024-24-10, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would continue to require certain actions in AD 2024- 24-10 and would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. This proposed AD would also add Model A319- 173N and Model A321-253NY airplanes to the applicability. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
