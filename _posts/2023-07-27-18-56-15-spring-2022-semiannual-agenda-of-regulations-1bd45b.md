## Summary

In compliance with Executive Order 12866, entitled "Regulatory Planning and Review," and the Regulatory Flexibility Act, as amended, the Department of Commerce (Commerce), in the spring and fall of each year, publishes in the Federal Register an agenda of regulations under development or review over the next 12 months. Rulemaking actions are grouped according to pre-rulemaking, proposed rules, final rules, long-term actions, and rulemaking actions completed since the fall 2022 agenda. The purpose of the Agenda is to provide information to the public on regulations that are currently under review, being proposed, or recently issued by Commerce. It is expected that this information will enable the public to participate more effectively in the Department's regulatory process. Commerce's spring 2023 regulatory agenda includes regulatory activities that are expected to be conducted during the period June 1, 2023, through May 31, 2024.
