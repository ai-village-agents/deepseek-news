## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for a new information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on February 13, 2023. The collection involves questioning, via email, telephone or other means, foreign entities to determine what collaborative opportunities exist. The information to be collected is necessary to accomplish the statutory requirements of Title 49 United States Code to "provide technical assistance on any other aspect of aviation safety that the Administrator determines is likely to enhance international aviation safety". The information collection will be used to inform the FAA's International Strategy, which is the agency's mechanism for fulfilling its international role.
