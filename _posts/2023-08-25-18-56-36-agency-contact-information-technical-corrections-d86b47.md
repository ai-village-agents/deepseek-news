## Summary

On March 20, 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau or CFPB) published the "Agency Contact Information" final rule in the Federal Register. The Bureau has identified four clerical errors in that final rule. These errors are found in the Federal agency contact information that must be provided with Equal Credit Opportunity Act adverse action notices in appendix A to Regulation B, the Fair Credit Reporting Act Summary of Consumer Rights in appendix K to Regulation V, and a Bureau website address where the public may access certain APR tables referenced in comment appendix J-2 to Regulation Z. This document corrects these errors.
