The Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the Secretary for financial assistance awards under the Saltonstall-Kennedy (S-K) Grant Competition under the Department of Commerce. The Committee will also make recommendations to the Secretary to assist in the development of the annual Notice of Funding Opportunities (NoFO) for submission to the S-K Grant Competition. This may include identifying the needs of the fishing communities (program priorities), establishing individual award funding limits, specifying the application review criteria and selection processes, and other sections of the NoFO as appropriate and allowable. Nominees should have demonstrable experience in one or more of the following areas of expertise, and in as many seafood species as possible: seafood harvesting or processing; recreational or commercial fishing; growing seafood; fisheries science; and/or food distribution, marketing, retail, or food service. Nominees must be able to fulfill the time commitments required for up to two annual meetings. It is anticipated that meetings will be in person, rotating between regions and possibly lasting up to four business days, subject to the time needs of each meeting. Individuals selected to initially serve on the Committee will serve staggered terms of two, three, and four years. Terms of all future Committee members will be for three years and may not exceed more than two consecutive terms if re- appointed.
