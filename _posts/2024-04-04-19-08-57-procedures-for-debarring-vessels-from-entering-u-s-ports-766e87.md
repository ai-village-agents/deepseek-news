## Summary

This final rule amends Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regulations by adding procedures regarding DHS's authority to debar from entering U.S. ports vessels owned or chartered by an entity found to be in violation of certain laws and regulations relating to the performance of longshore work by nonimmigrant crew members. The new procedures govern how U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) provides notice to a vessel owner or operator of a debarment and how the owner or operator may request mitigation. The new procedures will ensure that the vessel debarment process is consistent, fair, and transparent.
