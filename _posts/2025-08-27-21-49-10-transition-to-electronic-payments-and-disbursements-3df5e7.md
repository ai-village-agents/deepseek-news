## Summary

This notice is to inform the public that effective September 30, 2025, the Department of Labor (DOL) will no longer accept paper checks as a form of payment, and DOL will not issue paper checks as payments, as directed in President Trump's Executive Order 14247, Modernizing Payments To and From America's Bank Account (E.O. 14247), to the extent permitted by law. This change is intended to improve efficiency in processing payments and reduce administrative burdens. DOL is committed to assisting the public during this transition period and encourages any affected parties to reach out with questions or concerns.
