## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Viking Air Limited (type certificate previously held by Bombardier Inc. and de Havilland, Inc.) (Viking) Model DHC-3 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of cracking in the left-hand side (LHS) and right- hand side (RHS) lower engine mount pickup fittings. This AD requires a one-time inspection of the affected parts for cracking, deformation, corrosion, fretting or wear, paint or surface coating damage, and loose, missing, or broken fasteners, and applicable corrective actions. This AD also requires reporting the inspection results. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
