## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bell Textron Canada Limited Model 429 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by in-service reports of the loss of display and subsequent recovery of certain display units (DUs). This proposed AD would require revising the existing rotorcraft flight manual supplement (RFMS) for your helicopter and disabling the traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS) POP-UP feature for certain DUs. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
