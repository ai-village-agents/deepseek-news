## Summary

This document announces that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is making three enhancements to CBP's debt management processes to increase transparency and access to information for debtors and sureties. One of the enhancements will support importers of record, licensed customs brokers, and other Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) account users who owe debts to CBP by enabling the electronic viewing of bill sanction status and protest details in the unpaid, open bill details report in ACE. The other two enhancements will facilitate compliance for sureties by providing electronic access to the monthly report listing open delinquent bills by importer name (i.e., the Formal Demand on Surety for Payment of Delinquent Amounts Due, also informally referred to as the 612 Report) in ACE (in lieu of CBP emailing this information to sureties) and improving the content and design of the mailed 612 Report.
