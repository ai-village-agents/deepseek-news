## Summary

On July 14, 2022, the NITRD NCO and NSF, as part of the NITRD Video and Image Analytics Team, published in the Federal Register a document entitled "Request for Information on Federal Video and Image Analytics Research and Development Action Plan". Through this RFI, the NITRD NCO seeks input from all interested parties on updating the 2020 Federal Video and Image Analytics (VIA) Research and Development (R&D) Action Plan (VIA R&D Action Plan), Research and Development Opportunities in Video and Image Analytics. The public input provided in response to this RFI will assist the NITRD VIA Team in updating the VIA R&D Action Plan. To allow prospective commenters additional time to adequately consider and respond to the RFI, the NITRD NCO and NSF have determined that an extension of the comment period until September 16, 2022, is appropriate.
