## Summary

The Library of Congress is reauthorizing a public committee to provide a forum for the technology-related aspects of the U.S. Copyright Office's modernization initiative. Given the success of the previous Copyright Public Modernization Committee (CPMC) and the value and insights provided by CPMC members, the Library wants to renew the committee for an additional term. Therefore, the Library will accept applications from qualified members of the public to serve on this committee. Membership will be on a volunteer basis, with the expectation of participation in at least two virtual or hybrid open forums a year at the member's own expense.
