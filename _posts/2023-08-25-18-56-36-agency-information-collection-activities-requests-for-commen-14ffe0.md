## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for a renewed information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on January 25, 2023. FAA received two comments to this notice. The collection involves a request that airplane operators subject to the applicability of Annex 16, Volume IV of the Convention on Civil Aviation (hereinafter the "Chicago Convention") submit electronically an Emissions Monitoring Plan (EMP), an annual Emissions Report (ER), and an optional annual ER CORSIA Eligible Fuels Annex (CEFA) to the FAA. The information to be collected is necessary because FAA will use the information to fulfill the United States' responsibilities under the Chicago Convention.
