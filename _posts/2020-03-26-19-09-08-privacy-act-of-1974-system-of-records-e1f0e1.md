## Summary

The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) is modifying the DoD Personnel Accountability and Assessment System, DPR 39 DoD, for the purpose of more clearly covering records that may be maintained in response to public health and safety events or other similar emergencies such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The DoD blanket routine uses were removed and replaced with specific routine uses that explain the entities to which disclosures would be made.
