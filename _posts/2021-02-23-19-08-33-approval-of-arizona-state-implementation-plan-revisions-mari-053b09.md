## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing action on revisions to the Maricopa County Air Quality Department (MCAQD) portion of the state implementation plan (SIP) for the State of Arizona. We are proposing full approval of seven MCAQD rules for the Department's New Source Review (NSR) preconstruction permitting program for new and modified stationary sources of air pollution. We are taking comments on this proposed rule and plan to follow with a final action.
