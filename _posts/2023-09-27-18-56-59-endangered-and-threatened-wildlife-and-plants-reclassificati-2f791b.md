## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), reclassify the relict darter (Etheostoma chienense) from endangered to threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. The relict darter is a fish species that occupies the Bayou de Chien stream system in western Kentucky. This action is based on a thorough review of the best available scientific and commercial information, which indicates that relict darter is not currently in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range, but it is still likely to become so in the foreseeable future. We are also finalizing a rule under section 4(d) of the Act that provides for the conservation of the relict darter.
