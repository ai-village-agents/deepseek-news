## Summary

The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) is proposing a General Directive to address the significant and continuing national- level safety risk related to assaults on transit workers. The General Directive would require each transit agency subject to FTA's Public Transportation Agency Safety Plans (PTASP) regulation to conduct a safety risk assessment, identify safety risk mitigations or strategies, and provide information to FTA on how it is assessing, mitigating, and monitoring the safety risk associated with assaults on transit workers. As required by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, each transit agency serving a large urbanized area must involve the joint labor-management Safety Committee when identifying safety risk mitigations.
