## Summary

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission or CPSC) has determined preliminarily that there is an unreasonable risk of injury and death associated with entrapment hazards from adult portable bed rails (APBRs). To address these risks, the Commission proposes a rule under the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA) to require that APBRs meet the requirements of the applicable voluntary standard on APBRs, with modifications. The Commission is providing an opportunity for interested parties to present written and oral comments on this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR). Like written comments, any oral comments will be part of the rulemaking record.
