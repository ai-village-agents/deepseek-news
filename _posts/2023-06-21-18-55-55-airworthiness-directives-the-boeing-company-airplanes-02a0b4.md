## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-04- 05, which applied to all The Boeing Company Model 757 and 767 airplanes. AD 2022-04-05 required revising the limitations and operating procedures sections of the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to incorporate specific operating procedures for landing distance calculations, instrument landing system (ILS) approaches, non-precision approaches, speedbrake deployment, and go-around and missed approaches, when in the presence of interference from wireless broadband operations in the 3.7-3.98 GHz frequency band (5G C-Band) as identified by Notices to Air Missions (NOTAMs). Since the FAA issued AD 2022-04-05, the FAA determined that additional limitations are needed due to the continued deployment of new 5G C-Band base stations whose signals are expected to cover most of the contiguous United States at transmission frequencies between 3.7-3.98 GHz. This AD requires revising the limitations and operating procedures sections of the existing AFM to incorporate specific operating procedures for landing distance calculations, ILS approaches, non-precision approaches, speedbrake deployment, and go- around and missed approaches, due to the presence of 5G C-Band interference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
