## Summary

The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2022 (PRIA 5) requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to begin to seek stakeholder input on ways to make bilingual pesticide labeling accessible to farmworkers by June 30, 2023, and to implement a plan to ensure that farmworkers have access to the bilingual pesticide labeling by December 2025. EPA hosted the Bilingual Pesticide Labeling National Webinar on June 15, 2023 and is opening a docket to receive written public comments. The purpose of the public comment period is to obtain feedback from stakeholders on ways to make bilingual pesticide labeling accessible to farmworkers to aid in the development of a plan to ensure that farmworkers have access to the bilingual pesticide labeling. Public input that includes environmental justice perspectives with solutions will be key in helping the Agency develop a strong starting point for addressing historical disadvantages for farmworkers.
