## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Piper Aircraft, Inc. (Piper) Model PA-46-350P, PA-46-500TP, and PA-46-600TP airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that a bearing fell out of a control column mount during routine handling prior to installation in an affected airplane and the discovery that a quality escape condition could exist on other airplanes. This AD requires inspecting the left and right control column mounts to determine if a retaining ring is installed. If a retaining ring is not installed, this AD requires inspecting the bearing in the mount block for the presence of retaining compound, and depending on the inspection results, installing a retaining ring and applying retaining compound to the bearing, as applicable. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
