## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations, the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is announcing its intention to revise the approved information collection regarding its Public Health Information System (PHIS). The Agency has increased the burden estimate by 433 hours due to the addition of the FSIS Form 9060-5EP, Egg Products Export Certificate of Wholesomeness. FSIS is currently issuing FSIS Form 9060-5 (meat and poultry) and 9060-5S (Siluriformes) export certificates for 38 countries and territories through the PHIS export component (i.e., providing an electronic export certificate application for exporters and the FSIS Form 9060-5/5S printed on security paper). At this time, FSIS is seeking OMB approval to collect information for the existing paper FSIS Form 9060-5EP. FSIS will request additional approval for the electronic collection of information when egg products are added into the PHIS export component. FSIS will announce its plans to add egg products to the PHIS export component through a subsequent notice to the public, likely through the Agency's Constituent Update. The approval for this information collection will expire on August 31, 2022.
