## Summary

On July 10, 2025, the Department of Justice erroneously published 30-day notices for four information collection requests. These notices were incorrect, were published prematurely, and the reginfo.gov system did not open them for public comment. The Department published correct notices for these same four ICRs, on July 23, 2025, each with an open 30-day public notice and comment period. Reviewers should disregard the notices published on July 10 and instead review and comment on the notices published on July 23, 2025.
