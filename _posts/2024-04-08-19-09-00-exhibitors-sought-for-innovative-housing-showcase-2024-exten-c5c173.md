## Summary

On February 28, 2024, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) published in the Federal Register a document entitled, "Exhibitors Sought for Innovative Housing Showcase 2024." The document sought proposals for exhibits at the 2024 Innovative Housing Showcase, a public event to raise awareness of innovative housing designs and technologies that have the potential to increase housing supply, lower the cost of construction, and/or reduce housing expenses for owners and renters. The original notice provided for a 30- day period during which proposals would be accepted, which ended on March 29, 2024. HUD has determined that an extension of the proposal submission period until April 15, 2024, is appropriate to allow additional interested exhibitors to submit proposals.
