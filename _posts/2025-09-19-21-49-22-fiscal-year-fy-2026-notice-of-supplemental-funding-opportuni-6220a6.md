## Summary

This notice is to inform the public that the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is supporting an administrative supplement in scope of the parent award for an eligible grant recipient funded under the FY 2022 Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC) Planning, Development and Implementation Grants Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) SM-22-002. The total available funding is $2,000,000. This supplemental funding will be used to expand CCBHC services to the Kensington area in Philadelphia, PA, which is currently experiencing one of the highest overdose mortality rates in the nation. The proliferation of new medetomidine-linked overdoses and associated medical complications, along with the emergence of a homeless encampment in April and May of 2024, meets the threshold of a novel, unanticipated public health event and provides a compelling rationale for targeted action through a non-competitive supplement to an existing CCBHC to provide comprehensive mental health and substance use services in Kensington.
