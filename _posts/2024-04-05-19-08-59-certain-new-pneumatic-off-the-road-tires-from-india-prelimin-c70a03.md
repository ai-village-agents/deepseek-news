## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily determines that certain producers/exporters subject to this administrative review made sales of subject merchandise at less than normal value (NV) during the period of review (POR) March 1, 2022, through February 28, 2023. We are also rescinding this administrative review, in part, with respect to 10 companies because these companies had no reviewable entries of subject merchandise during the POR. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.
