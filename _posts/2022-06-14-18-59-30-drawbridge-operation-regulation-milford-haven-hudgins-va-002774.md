## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to modify the operating schedule that governs the SR223 (Gwynn's Island) Bridge, across Milford Haven, mile 0.1, at Hudgins, Virginia. This proposed temporary modification will allow the drawbridge to be maintained in the closed-to-navigation position and is necessary to accommodate bridge maintenance. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
