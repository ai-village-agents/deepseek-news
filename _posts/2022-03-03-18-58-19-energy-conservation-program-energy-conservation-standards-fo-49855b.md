## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") will hold a webinar to discuss and receive comments on the preliminary analysis it has conducted for purposes of evaluating energy conservation standards for battery chargers. The meeting will cover the analytical framework, models, and tools that DOE is using to evaluate potential standards for this product; the results of preliminary analyses performed by DOE for this product; the potential energy conservation standard levels derived from these analyses that DOE could consider for this product should it determine that proposed amendments are necessary; and any other issues relevant to the evaluation of energy conservation standards for battery chargers. In addition, DOE encourages written comments on these subjects. To inform interested parties and to facilitate this process, DOE has prepared an agenda, a preliminary technical support document ("TSD"), and briefing materials, which are available on the DOE website at: www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/ standards.aspx?productid=26&action=viewlive.
