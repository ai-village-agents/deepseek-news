## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving adoptions, repeals, and amendments to the New Jersey State Implementation Plan (SIP) concerning exemptions to improve resiliency during emergency situations, updates to hazardous air pollutant (HAP) reporting thresholds, updates to the certification and submission of emission statements, and the addition of Federal New Source Review (NSR) requirements for fine particles (PM<INF>2.5</INF>). The intended effect of New Jersey's revisions are to enable government and business entities to be more resilient during and following disruptions from natural and human-caused disasters; update HAP unit risk factors and reference concentrations to reflect current research, scientific, and technological advancements; update provisions to require the reporting of PM<INF>2.5</INF> and ammonia (NH3) emissions at the source level and update the electronic reporting of emission statements to adapt with advancements and Federal requirements; and conform the State's rules on air permits to the EPA's NSR requirements for PM<INF>2.5</INF> to ensure a source does not adversely impact the EPA-established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Other revisions New Jersey made, which the EPA is approving with this notice of final rulemaking, will conform administrative penalties to the approved rules and correct errors and inconsistencies throughout the State's SIP. This action is being taken in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act. The EPA proposed to approve this rule on September 28, 2023, and received no comments.
