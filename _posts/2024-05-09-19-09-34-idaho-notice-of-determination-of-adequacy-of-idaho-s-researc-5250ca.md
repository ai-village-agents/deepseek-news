## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving Idaho's modification to its approved Municipal Solid Waste Landfill (MSWLF) permit program. On March 22, 2004, the EPA issued final regulations allowing Research, Development, and Demonstration (RD&D) permits to be issued to certain MSWLFs by approved states. On September 14, 2023, the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality submitted an application to the EPA seeking Federal approval of its RD&D requirements. The EPA has reviewed the application and determined it to be adequate.
