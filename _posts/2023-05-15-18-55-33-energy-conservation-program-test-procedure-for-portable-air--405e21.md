# Energy Conservation Program: Test Procedure for Portable Air Conditioners

## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") amends the current test procedure for portable air conditioners ("portable ACs") to incorporate a measure of variable-speed portable AC performance, generally consistent with previously granted waivers, and to make minor clarifying edits. DOE also establishes a new test procedure for portable ACs that provides more representative measures of cooling capacity and energy consumption. The new test procedure will provide the basis for development of any updated efficiency standards for portable ACs. Should DOE establish such standards, the amended test procedure would become the required test method for determining compliance.
