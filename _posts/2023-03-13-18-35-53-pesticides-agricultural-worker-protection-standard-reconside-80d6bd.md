## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to reinstate certain requirements that were amended in 2020 regarding the application exclusion zone (AEZ) requirements of the Agricultural Worker Protection Standard (WPS). EPA has reconsidered the amended AEZ requirements and has determined that several aspects of the AEZ provisions, such as those regarding the applicability of the AEZ and distance determination criteria, should be revised to reinstate previous requirements that are protective of public health and to limit exposure for those who may be near ongoing pesticide applications.
