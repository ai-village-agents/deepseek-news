## Summary

The Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA), as amended by the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA), required the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or the Commission) to publish, as a mandatory consumer product safety standard, the American National Standard for Four-Wheel All-Terrain Vehicles (ATVs) developed by the Specialty Vehicle Institute of America (ANSI/SVIA 1-2007). CPSC published that mandatory consumer product safety standard in November 2008. In March 2023, ANSI/SVIA issued a 2023 edition of its standard. In accordance with the CPSA, CPSC is issuing this final rule to amend the Commission's mandatory ATV standard to reference the 2023 edition of the ANSI/SVIA 1 standard.
