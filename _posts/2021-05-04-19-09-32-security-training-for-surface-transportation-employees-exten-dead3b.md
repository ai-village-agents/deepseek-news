## Summary

This action amends the "Security Training for Surface Transportation Employees" (Security Training) final rule (published March 23, 2020, and amended May 1, 2020, and October 26, 2020) to extend the compliance date by which a security training program must be submitted to TSA, and make minor technical corrections. TSA is aware that many owner/operators within the scope of this rule's applicability may be unable to meet the compliance deadline for submission of the required security training programs to TSA for approval because of the impact of COVID-19 as well as actions taken at various levels of government to address this public health crisis. In response, TSA is extending the compliance deadline for submission of the required security training program from March 22, 2021, to no later than June 21, 2021. Should TSA determine that an additional extension of time is necessary based upon the impact of the COVID-19 public health crisis, TSA will publish a document in the Federal Register announcing an updated compliance date for this requirement.
