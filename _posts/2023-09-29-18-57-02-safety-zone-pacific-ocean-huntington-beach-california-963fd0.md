## Summary

The U.S. Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone offshore of Huntington Beach, CA in support of the Pacific Airshow. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters in the area of the air and water demonstrations and to protect the high concentration of people attending the event. This regulation prohibits vessels from entering into, transiting through, or remaining within the designated area unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port, Sector Los Angeles--Long Beach (COTP), or a designated representative.
