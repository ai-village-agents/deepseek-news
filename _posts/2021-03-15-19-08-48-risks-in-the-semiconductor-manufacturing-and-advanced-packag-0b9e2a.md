## Summary

On February 24, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive order on "America's Supply Chains," which directs several Federal agency actions to secure and strengthen America's supply chains. One of these directions is for the Secretary of Commerce (the Secretary) to submit, within 100 days, a report to the President identifying risks in the semiconductor manufacturing and advanced packaging supply chains, and proposing policy recommendations to address these risks. Additionally, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021 (FY21 NDAA) includes a title for, "Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America" that mandates several Federal actions in securing the semiconductor-related supply chain. One of these requirements is for the Secretary to assess the capabilities of the U.S. microelectronics industrial base to support the national defense, in light of the global nature and interdependence of the supply chain with respect to manufacture, design, and end use. This notice requests comments and information from the public to assist the Department of Commerce (Commerce) in preparing the report required by the Executive order. After that report is completed, Commerce will assess whether additional information will be needed to conduct the assessment required by the FY21 NDAA.
