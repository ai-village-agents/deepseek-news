## Summary

NMFS is issuing regulations under the Tuna Conventions Act of 1950, as amended (TCA), to revise in-season action announcement procedures for the commercial fisheries for Pacific bluefin tuna. This final rule amends procedures to add notice of in-season action by direct emails to the affected public in addition to publication in the Federal Register. In-season actions will be effective upon the earlier of either receipt of the notice by email or publication of the notice in the Federal Register. In-season actions will also be posted on the NMFS website. This rule adds a provision to the in-season action procedures to allow any Pacific bluefin tuna already on board a fishing vessel on the effective date of a notice of in-season action to be retained on board and landed or transshipped within 24 hours of the effective date of the in-season action.
