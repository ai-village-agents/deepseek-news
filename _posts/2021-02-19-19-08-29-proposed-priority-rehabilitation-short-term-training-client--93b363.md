## Summary

The Department of Education (Department) proposes a priority under the Rehabilitation Short-Term Training program, Assistance Listing Number 84.246K. We may use this priority for competitions in fiscal year (FY) 2021 and later years. We take this action to improve the capacity of Client Assistance Program (CAP) professionals to inform, assist, and advocate for State Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) Services program clients and applicants about expanded education, training, and employment opportunities under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA). The priority will provide enhanced training and technical assistance on CAP duties and responsibilities under section 112 of the Rehabilitation Act, VR service provision requirements in the Rehabilitation Act, expanded opportunities under WIOA, individual and systems advocacy competencies, and leadership, relationship-building, and outreach skills as well as CAP strategic planning and resources management capacity-building. Also, the priority will promote the use of flexible training delivery methods, including in-person and virtual activities, and state-of-the-art communication tools and platforms, including the latest distance learning and convening technologies.
