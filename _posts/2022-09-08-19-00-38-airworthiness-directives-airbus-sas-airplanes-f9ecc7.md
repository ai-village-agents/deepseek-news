## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-22- 03, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A330-200, -200 Freighter, and -300 series airplanes. AD 2020-22-03 required revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to incorporate procedures to be applied if an engine bleed over-temperature occurs when the associated engine bleed valve is jammed open, and provided for the optional embodiment of updated flight warning computer (FWC) software, which terminated the AFM revision. This AD was prompted by the development of new maintenance actions and software related to over-temperature failure conditions. This AD continues to require the actions specified in AD 2020-22-03, requires accomplishing the new maintenance tasks and corrective actions, and mandates embodiment of the updated FWC software for certain airplanes, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also prohibits the installation of affected FWC software. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
