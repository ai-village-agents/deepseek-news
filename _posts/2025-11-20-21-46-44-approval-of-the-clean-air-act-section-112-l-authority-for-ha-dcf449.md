## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving regulatory amendments that revise two previous program approvals from the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CT DEEP). The revisions include amendments to the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies (RCSA) that revise the Connecticut State Operating Permit Program and amendments to RCSA that revise limitations on potential to emit Clean Air Act (CAA) pollutants. A significant aspect of this action involves revising the definition of "hazardous air pollutant" in the RCSA in response to EPA adding 1-bromopropane to the list of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). This action is being taken under the Clean Air Act.
