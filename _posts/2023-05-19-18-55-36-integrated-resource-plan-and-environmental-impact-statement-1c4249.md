## Summary

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is conducting a study of its energy resources. The Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) is a comprehensive study of how TVA will meet the demand for electricity in its service territory. TVA's most recent IRP was adopted by the TVA Board in 2019. As part of this new study, TVA will prepare a programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to assess the impacts associated with the implementation of the next IRP. The EIS analyzes significant environmental impacts to the combined TVA power service area and the Tennessee River watershed (TVA region) that could result from the targeted power supply mix studied in the IRP. TVA will use the EIS process to elicit and prioritize the values and concerns of stakeholders; identify issues, trends, events, and tradeoffs affecting TVA's policies; formulate, evaluate, and compare alternative portfolios of energy resource options; provide opportunities for public review and comment; and ensure that TVA's evaluation of alternative energy resource strategies reflects a full range of stakeholder input. Public comment is invited concerning both the scope of the EIS and environmental issues that should be addressed as a part of this EIS.
