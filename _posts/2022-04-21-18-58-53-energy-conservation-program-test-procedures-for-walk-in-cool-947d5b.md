## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") proposes to amend the test procedures for walk-in coolers and walk-in freezers to harmonize with updated industry standards, revise the test methods to more fully represent field energy use, and better account for the range of walk-in cooler and walk-in freezer component equipment designs. DOE also proposes to revise certain definitions applicable to walk-ins. DOE is seeking comment from interested parties on the proposal and announcing a public meeting to collect comments and data on its proposal.
