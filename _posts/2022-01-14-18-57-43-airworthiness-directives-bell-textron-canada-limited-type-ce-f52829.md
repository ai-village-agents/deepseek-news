## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-20-06, which applies to certain Bell Helicopter Textron Canada Limited (now Bell Textron Canada Limited) Model 429 helicopters. AD 2020-20-06 requires repetitive inspections of certain cyclic and collective assembly bearings. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-20-06, the collective and cyclic bellcrank assemblies have been upgraded with corrosion resistant steel bearings. This proposed AD would retain some of the requirements of AD 2020-20-06 and depending on the inspection results, would require removing certain parts from service and installing the upgraded cyclic and collective bellcrank assemblies. This proposed AD would also require installing the upgraded collective and cyclic bellcrank assemblies on certain helicopters if not already installed, and would prohibit installing certain bellcrank assemblies. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
