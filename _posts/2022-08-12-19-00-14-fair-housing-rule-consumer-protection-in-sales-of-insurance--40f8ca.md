## Summary

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) published a document in the Federal Register of August 8, 2022, making technical corrections to two regulations to reflect a reorganization and change in the name of its former Consumer Response Center to the National Center for Consumer and Depositor Assistance. The document incorrectly listed the name of the National Center for Consumer and Depositor Assistance. This document corrects the regulations.
