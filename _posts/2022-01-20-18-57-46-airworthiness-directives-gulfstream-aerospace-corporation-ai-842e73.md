## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-12-06 for all Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation (Gulfstream) Model G-IV airplanes. AD 2020-12-06 required replacing the nose wheel steering servo valve manifold, incorporating revised operating procedures into the airplane flight manual (AFM), doing a records inspection for any incidents of un-commanded nose wheel steering turns, and reporting the results to the FAA. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-12-16, the FAA determined that a typographical error was made in citing one of the AFM documents. This AD retains the actions of AD 2020-12-06 and corrects the citation to the AFM. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
