## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bell Textron Inc., Model 204B, 205A, 205A-1, 205B, 210, 212, 412, 412CF, and 412EP helicopters; certain Erickson 214 Holdings, LLC, Model 214B and 214B-1 helicopters; certain Leonardo S.p.a. Model AB412 and AB412 EP helicopters; and certain various restricted category helicopters. This AD was prompted by reports of two in-service failures of forward crosstubes due to fatigue damage and the issuance of newly established life limits. This AD requires determining the total number of landings on certain part-numbered forward crosstubes and incorporating requirements (airworthiness limitations) into existing maintenance records. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
