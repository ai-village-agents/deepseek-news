## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is soliciting public comments and suggestions about seeds treated with a pesticide registered under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as well as treated paint. The Agency is considering whether a rule under FIFRA to regulate certain use of treated seed and treated paint products or other administrative action is appropriate considering questions raised by stakeholders. To inform this consideration, EPA is requesting comment and information from all stakeholders on the use and usage of treated seed, including storage, planting, and disposal of the treated seed, and on whether or to what extent treated seed products are being distributed, sold, and used contrary to treating pesticide and treated seed product labeling instructions. Similarly, EPA is requesting comment from stakeholders on the addition of labeling requirements on the labels of treated paint products and potential language that should be included in those labels.
