## Summary

The Commission has established a schedule and procedure, set forth below, for conducting roundtables, an academic symposium, and a hearing in connection with this investigation. The Commission will hold seven roundtable discussions between March 1 and April 1, 2022, an academic symposium on April 5-6, 2022, and a hearing on April 19, 2022. The roundtables, academic symposium, and hearing will focus on the potential distributional effects of goods and services trade and trade policy on U.S. workers by skill, wage and salary level, gender, race/ ethnicity, age, and income level, especially as they affect underrepresented and underserved communities. The roundtables and hearing will afford an opportunity for interested persons to present information and views relating to the investigation, and the academic symposium will afford an opportunity for researchers and data experts to present work relevant to the investigation. The Commission instituted the investigation under section 332(g) of the Tariff Act of 1930 following receipt, on October 14, 2021, of a request from the U.S. Trade Representative.
