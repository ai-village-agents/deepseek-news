## Summary

This notice is to inform the public that the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is supporting an administrative supplement in scope of the parent award for the one eligible grant recipient funded in FY 2023 under the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Center for Excellence (HBCU-CFE) grant, Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) (TI-23-015). The recipient may receive up to $350,000 total funding. This recipient has a project end date of September 29, 2026. The supplement expands SAMHSA's engagement with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) by supporting a series of strategic initiatives that promote behavioral health career exploration and student wellness. These efforts are aligned with Executive Order 14283, The White House Initiative to Promote Excellence and Innovation at Historically Black Colleges and Universities and focus on building active public-private sector and philanthropic partnerships to advance shared goals related to student success and retention and creating professional development opportunities for HBCU students to help build America's workforce in behavioral health. The initiative will include the formation of a planning committee and a national convening of HBCU educators and behavioral health professionals to co-develop a shared vision and strategy. A key deliverable will be the creation of a behavioral health career exploration curriculum tailored to high school, community college, and early college students, with plans for national dissemination through local educational agencies. To further support student wellness and crisis prevention, the program will co-develop peer-led, campus-based interventions focused on suicide and crisis prevention and launch a culturally responsive 988 education and public awareness campaign tailored to HBCU communities. Together, these efforts will strengthen behavioral health workforce pathways, foster innovation, and align with Executive Order 14283 by advancing excellence and opportunity across HBCUs.
