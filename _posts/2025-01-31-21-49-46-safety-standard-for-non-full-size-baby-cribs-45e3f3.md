## Summary

In December 2010, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) published a consumer product safety standard for non-full-size baby cribs (NFS cribs) pursuant to section 104 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA). The Commission's mandatory standard incorporates by reference ASTM F406, Standard Consumer Safety Specification for Non-Full-Size Baby Cribs/ Play Yards, with modifications that exclude sections of ASTM F406 that apply to play yards exclusively. The CPSIA sets forth a process for updating mandatory standards for durable infant or toddler products that are based on a voluntary standard, when a voluntary standards organization revises the standard. On August 1, 2024, ASTM approved a revised voluntary standard, and this direct final rule updates the mandatory standard for NFS cribs to incorporate by reference the 2024 version of ASTM F406.
