U.S. Army Soldiers assigned to 2d Infantry Division Sustainment Brigade, 2d Infantry Division/ROK-U.S. Combined Division, operate an M2 .50 caliber Machine Gun at Rodriguez Live Fire Complex, South Korea, Feb. 4, 2026. Champion Brigade operated the 2ID Consolidated Gunnery and sent crews from each of its own battalions to qualify on M2 .50 Caliber and M240 Machine Guns so 2ID can remain ready to fight tonight.
