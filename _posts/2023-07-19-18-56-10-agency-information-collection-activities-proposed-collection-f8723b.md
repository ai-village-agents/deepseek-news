## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice invites the general public and other public agencies to comment on this proposed information collection. This collection is a new collection. The primary purpose of this study is to provide FNS with information about SNAP State agencies' use of risk assessment (RA) tools to reduce payment errors, the effects of these tools, and best practices for FNS and the SNAP State agencies to consider in the development and use of RA tools. RA tools may apply statistical models using SNAP household characteristics to estimate the relative risk of improper payment.
