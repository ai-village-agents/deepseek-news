## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-25- 18, which applied to certain BAE Systems (Operations) Limited Model BAe 146 and Model Avro 146-RJ series airplanes. AD 2022-25-18 required repetitive inspections for cracking of the main landing gear (MLG) side stay outer link and replacement if necessary. This AD was prompted by additional investigations of the causes of the cracking being conducted. This AD requires a reduction of the repetitive visual inspection interval, provides optional repetitive special detailed inspections, and requires accomplishing a one-off dimensional tolerance check and performing a repetitive lubrication of the MLG side stay outer link pivot, as specified in United Kingdom (U.K.) Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) (U.K. CAA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
