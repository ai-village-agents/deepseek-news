## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is finalizing actions pursuant to section 181(b)(2) of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) for most remaining areas in the country classified as "Serious" for the 2008 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) of 0.075 parts per million (ppm). Applying a uniform methodology, the Agency is determining that one Serious area attained the standards by the July 20, 2021, applicable attainment date and that five Serious areas failed to attain the standards by the applicable attainment date. The effect of failing to attain by the applicable attainment date is that these areas will be reclassified by operation of law to "Severe" nonattainment for the 2008 ozone NAAQS on November 7, 2022, the effective date of this final rule. Pursuant to its authority under the CAA, the Agency is establishing new, consistent deadlines by which the responsible state air agencies for the reclassified areas must submit State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions and implement controls to satisfy the statutory and regulatory requirements for Severe areas for the 2008 ozone NAAQS. Additionally, in areas reclassified as Severe, where not already prohibited, the CAA will prohibit the sale of conventional gasoline and require that federal reformulated gasoline instead be sold beginning 1 year after the effective date of this final rule, November 7, 2023.
