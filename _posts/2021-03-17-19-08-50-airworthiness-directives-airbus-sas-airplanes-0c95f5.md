## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-16- 02, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A318-111 and -112 airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, and -115 airplanes; Model A320-211, - 212, -214, and -216 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -211, -212, and -213 airplanes. AD 2018-16-02 required modifying and re-identifying the 3-lug aft engine mount assemblies. This AD continues to require modifying and re-identifying the 3-lug aft engine mount assemblies, and also requires modifying and re-identifying the 4-lug aft engine mount assemblies; as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD was prompted by a report of a production quality deficiency on the inner retainer installed on link assemblies of the aft engine mount, which could result in failure of the retainer. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
