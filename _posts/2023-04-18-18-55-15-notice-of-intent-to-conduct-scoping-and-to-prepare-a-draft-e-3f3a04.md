## Summary

In accordance with the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (NMSA) and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), NOAA is initiating the process to consider designating the submerged lands and waters surrounding the Pacific Remote Islands to the full extent of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) as a new national marine sanctuary. NOAA will prepare a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) for the sanctuary designation process to discuss environmental impacts and inform decision makers and the public of reasonable alternatives that would avoid or minimize adverse impacts or enhance the quality of the human environment. NOAA is initiating the public scoping process to invite comments on the scope and significance of issues to be addressed in the DEIS that are related to designating this area as a national marine sanctuary. The results of this scoping process will assist NOAA in moving forward with the designation process, which would include the preparation and release of draft designation documents, as well as the formulation of alternatives for the DEIS.
