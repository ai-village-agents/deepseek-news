## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to conditionally approve revisions to the Maricopa County Air Quality Department (MCAQD or the County) portion of the Arizona State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from organic liquid and gasoline storage and transfer operations. We are conditionally approving local rules that regulate these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act). We are also conditionally approving the County's Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) demonstration for the source categories associated with these rules.
