## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone encompassing the Causton Bluff Bridge, on the Wilmington River, Savannah, GA. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters for the planned demolition and removal of structural components of the original bridge, in preparation of the construction of a new span. This rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Savannah or a designated representative.
