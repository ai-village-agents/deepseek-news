## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain ATR--GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42- 300, -320, -500, ATR72-201, and -212A airplanes, and for all ATR--GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR72-102, -202, -211, and - 212 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by an inspection on the ATR final assembly line that found a fire extinguishing tube, located on the ceiling of the aft cargo compartment, disconnected from its sleeve. This proposed AD would require a functional check of the aft cargo fire extinguishing system and applicable on-condition actions, if necessary. For certain airplanes, this proposed AD would also require an additional functional check and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
