# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus SAS Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model Airbus A350-941 and A350-1041 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that, in the event of rapid decompression at a specific location of the airplane, possible deflections of the passenger floor cross beams may result in wiring damages, leading to potential system losses. This proposed AD would require amending the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to update the landing performance database, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
