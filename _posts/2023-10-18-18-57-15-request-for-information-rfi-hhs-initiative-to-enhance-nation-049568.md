## Summary

The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) are seeking broad public input from entities across the health care readiness community on a national, all-hazards standardized set of essential elements of information (EEIs) and vendor-neutral data collection mechanisms for hospital data that drive action for emergency preparedness and response. This input will inform efforts to provide recommendations for a standardized lens into the readiness of, stress on, and resources available in hospitals before, during, and after emergencies
