## Summary

We are extending the comment period for our proposed rule that would amend the animal disease traceability regulations. The proposed rule would require that eartags applied on or after a date 6 months (180 days) after publication in the Federal Register of a final rule following the proposed rule to be both visually and electronically readable in order to be recognized for use as official eartags for interstate movement of cattle and bison covered under the regulations. We also proposed to clarify certain record retention and record access requirements and revise some requirements pertaining to slaughter cattle. This action will allow interested persons additional time to prepare and submit comments.
