## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A300 B2-1C, B2K-3C, B2-203, B4-2C, B4-103, and B4-203 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations related to pylon maintenance are necessary. This AD requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations for pylon maintenance, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
