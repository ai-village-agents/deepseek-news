## Summary

The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is adopting a final rule amending the Western Balkans Stabilization Regulations and reissuing them in their entirety to further implement a June 26, 2001 Executive order and a May 28, 2003 Executive order related to the Western Balkans, and to implement a June 8, 2021 Western Balkans-related Executive order. This final rule replaces the regulations that were amended and reissued on June 29, 2011, and includes additional interpretive guidance and definitions, general licenses, and other regulatory provisions that will provide further guidance to the public. Due to the number of regulatory sections being updated or added, OFAC is reissuing the Western Balkans Stabilization Regulations in their entirety.
