## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing a limited approval and limited disapproval of a revision to the Eastern Kern Air Pollution Control District (EKAPCD) portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) from stationary gas turbines. We are proposing action on a local rule that regulates these emissions sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA). We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
