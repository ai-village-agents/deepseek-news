## Summary

This document establishes FAA policy for proposals by sponsors of federally-obligated airports to construct solar energy systems on airport property. FAA is publishing this policy because it is in the public interest to enhance safety by analyzing ocular impact of proposed solar energy systems on airport traffic control tower personnel. The policy applies to proposed on-airport solar energy systems at federally-obligated towered airports. This policy replaces the Interim Policy published on October 23, 2013.
