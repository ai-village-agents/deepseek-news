## Summary

The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) is modifying an existing System of Records, Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS), DPR 34 DoD, by changing the system name and number to the Defense Civilian Human Resource Management System (DCHRMS), DHRA 23 DoD. The DCHRMS serves as the Department's enterprise civilian human resources (HR) automated system and supports one-third of the Federal work force. The Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service will manage the development, deployment, and administration of the DCHRMS operation. DCHRMS' operational activities will include the processing of all personnel transactions, position management, providing workforce analysis and reporting for the DoD and external government agencies, support for health insurance programs, managing benefits, performance management and reporting certification and training. DCHRMS will support the entire civilian HR life cycle, with transactions and information reflecting acquiring, assigning, training and development, sustaining and managing HR compensation, managing organizations, supporting benefits management, and separation or termination of civilian personnel.
