## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-23-05 for certain Airbus Helicopters Model EC225LP helicopters. AD 2020-23-05 required inspecting the control rod attachment yokes (yokes) of certain main rotor (M/R) rotating swashplates (swashplates), establishing a life limit, performing a one-time inspection of stripped yokes, and applicable corrective actions. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-23-05, the FAA has determined that certain swashplates are not susceptible to the unsafe condition, repetitive inspections for certain swashplates are necessary, and the criteria for when to perform a dye penetrant inspection needed to be revised. This AD retains some of the requirements of AD 2020-23-05 and also requires compliance with a revised life limit; performing a repetitive visual inspection of the yokes on certain swashplates; and depending on the inspection results, removing the affected swashplates from service, performing a dye penetrant inspection of the yoke, and additional corrective actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
