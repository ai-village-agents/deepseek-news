## Summary

This action proposes to establish Class C airspace, and remove Class D airspace, at the Harrisburg International Airport (MDT), PA. The FAA is proposing this action to enhance the efficient management of air traffic operations and reduce the potential for midair collision in the MDT terminal area. The Class C airspace would replace the existing Class D airspace at MDT. In addition, the non-regulatory Terminal Radar Service Area (TRSA) would be removed.
