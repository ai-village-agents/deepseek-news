## Summary

NMFS proposes to implement management measures described in a framework action under the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP), as prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council). If implemented, this proposed rule would modify the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) greater amberjack commercial trip limit and the recreational fixed closed season. Additionally, this proposed rule would clarify the Gulf red snapper charter vessel/headboat (for-hire) component quota and annual catch target (ACT) regulations. The purposes of this proposed rule are to extend the commercial and recreational fishing seasons for Gulf greater amberjack while continuing to prevent overfishing and rebuild the stock; and clarify that a person on a vessel issued a Gulf for-hire permit at any time during the fishing year can only harvest red snapper if the vessel is operating as a for-hire vessel.
