## Summary

We find that, under the Alien Nonpayment Provision of the Social Security Act (Act), as amended, citizens of Mongolia may not continue to receive Social Security benefits under title II after 6 consecutive calendar months of absence from the United States, unless they meet an exception not related to citizenship of Mongolia. This finding is based on law, information, and data we received about the social insurance system of Mongolia. The Commissioner of Social Security delegated the authority to make this finding to the Deputy Commissioner for Retirement and Disability Policy.
