FSIS is amending its regulations to exempt certain records maintained by its AssuranceNet (ANet) system of records from the notification and access provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (Privacy Act). FSIS is taking this action because ANet contains information directly associated with investigations conducted by FSIS for law enforcement purposes.
