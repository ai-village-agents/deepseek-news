## Summary

EPA and NHTSA, on behalf of the Department of Transportation, are issuing final rules to amend and establish carbon dioxide and fuel economy standards. Specifically, EPA is amending carbon dioxide standards for model years 2021 and later, and NHTSA is amending fuel economy standards for model year 2021 and setting new fuel economy standards for model years 2022-2026. The standards set by this action apply to passenger cars and light trucks, and will continue our nation's progress toward energy independence and carbon dioxide reduction, while recognizing the realities of the marketplace and consumers' interest in purchasing vehicles that meet all of their diverse needs. These final rules represent the second part of the Administration's action related to the August 24, 2018 proposed Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule. These final rules follow the agencies' actions, taken September 19, 2019, to ensure One National Program for automobile fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions standards, by finalizing regulatory text related to preemption under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act and withdrawing a waiver previously provided to California under the Clean Air Act.
