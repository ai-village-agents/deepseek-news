## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Science Advisory Board (SAB) Staff Office is expanding its request for nominations previously announced on April 5, 2022. The EPA SAB Staff Office previously requested nominations of scientific experts to form a panel to review EPA's new cloud-based Environmental Benefits and Mapping (BenMAP) tool, an open-source computer program that calculates estimated air pollution-related deaths and illnesses and their associated economic values. In that notice, the SAB Staff Office indicated its intention to announce a separate panel that would address the approach EPA takes for selecting and applying evidence in its PM<INF>2.5</INF> and Ozone (O<INF>3</INF>) benefits assessments. Because the two panels would require substantially similar expertise, the SAB Staff Office has now determined that it is appropriate to combine them into a single panel with a more comprehensive charge. The Science Advisory Board Staff Office is soliciting additional candidates to complement those nominated for the review of BenMAP.
