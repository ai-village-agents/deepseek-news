## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 717-200 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a nose landing gear-up landing caused by the failure of the upper lock link assembly. This proposed AD would require repetitive inspections for cracking of the upper lock link assembly and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
