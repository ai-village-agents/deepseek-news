## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce technical corrections for 62 wildlife and plant species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). These corrections include changes to scientific names of 11 wildlife species and 14 plant species due to taxonomic reclassification; changes to common names of 21 wildlife species and 13 plant species; and corrections to errors in scientific or common names, listing citations, or taxonomic heading placement for 4 wildlife species and 14 plant species. We are revising the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and the List of Endangered and Threatened Plants ("the Lists") to reflect the current scientifically accepted taxonomy and nomenclature of these species that occur in Idaho and the Pacific islands.
