## Summary

This final rule removes existing regulations concerning procedures applicable to the issuance of OPM's guidance documents. OPM is taking this action because President Biden revoked the authority for the regulations in an Executive order (E.O.) on January 20, 2021. Furthermore, OPM finds that the current procedures are impracticable and lack the flexibility needed for issuing guidance internally.
