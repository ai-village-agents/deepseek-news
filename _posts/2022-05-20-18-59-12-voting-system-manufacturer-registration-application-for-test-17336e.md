## Summary

In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the EAC announces an information collection and seeks public comment on the provisions thereof. The EAC intends to submit this proposed information collection to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget for approval. The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) is publishing four information collecting forms for its Voting System Testing and Certification Program. The information collected is to be used to improve the quality of voting systems used in federal elections, and to collect necessary key information on voting system manufacturers and their systems. Participation in this program is voluntary. The program is mandated by the Help America Vote Act (HAVA).
