# Overdraft Lending: Very Large Financial Institutions

## Summary

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) proposes to amend Regulations E and Z to update regulatory exceptions for overdraft credit provided by very large financial institutions, thereby ensuring that extensions of overdraft credit adhere to consumer protections required of similarly situated products, unless the overdraft fee is a small amount that only recovers applicable costs and losses. The proposal would allow consumers to better comparison shop across credit products and provide substantive protections that apply to other consumer credit.
