## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing an update of a portion of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Air Regulations proposed in the Federal Register on November 23, 2021. Requirements applying to OCS sources located within 25 miles of states' seaward boundaries must be updated periodically to remain consistent with the requirements of the corresponding onshore area (COA), as mandated by section 328(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act (CAA). The portion of the OCS air regulations that is being updated pertains to the requirements for OCS sources for which the State of New Jersey is the COA. The intended effect of approving the OCS requirements for the State of New Jersey is to regulate emissions from OCS sources in accordance with the requirements onshore. The requirements discussed below will be incorporated by reference into the Code of Federal Regulations and are listed in the appendix to the OCS air regulations.
