## Summary

The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), Department of Commerce is announcing its recruitment of candidates to serve on one of its seven Technical Advisory Committees ("TACs" or "Committees"). TAC members advise the Department of Commerce on the technical parameters for export controls applicable to dual-use items (commodities, software, and technology) and on the administration of those controls. The TACs are composed of representatives from industry, academia, and the U.S. Government and reflect diverse points of view on the concerns of the exporting community. Industry representatives are selected from firms producing a broad range of items currently controlled for national security, non-proliferation, foreign policy, and short supply reasons or that are proposed for such controls. Representation from the private sector is balanced to the extent possible among large and small firms. Six TACs are responsible for advising the Department of Commerce on the technical parameters for export controls and the administration of those controls within specified areas: Information Systems TAC: Control List Categories 3 (electronics), 4 (computers), and 5 (telecommunications and information security); Materials TAC: Control List Category 1 (materials, chemicals, microorganisms, and toxins); Materials Processing Equipment TAC: Control List Category 2 (materials processing); Sensors and Instrumentation TAC: Control List Category 6 (sensors and lasers); Transportation and Related Equipment TAC: Control List Categories 7 (navigation and avionics), 8 (marine), and 9 (propulsion systems, space vehicles, and related equipment); and the Emerging Technology TAC (identification of emerging and foundational technologies that may be developed over a period of five to ten years with potential dual-use applications). The seventh TAC, the Regulations and Procedures TAC, focuses on the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and procedures for implementing the EAR. TAC members are appointed by the Secretary of Commerce and serve terms of not more than four consecutive years. TAC members must obtain secret-level clearances prior to their appointment. These clearances are necessary so that members may be permitted access to classified information that may be needed to formulate recommendations to the Department of Commerce. Applicants are strongly encouraged to review materials and information on each Committee website, including the Committee's charter, to gain an understanding of each Committee's responsibilities, matters on which the Committee will provide recommendations, and expectations for members. Members of any of the seven TACs may not be registered as foreign agents under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. No TAC member may represent a company that is majority owned or controlled by a foreign government entity (or foreign government entities). TAC members will not be compensated for their services or reimbursed for their travel expenses. If you are interested in becoming a TAC member, please provide the following information: 1. Name of applicant; 2. affirmation of U.S. citizenship; 3. organizational affiliation and title, as appropriate; 4. mailing address; 5. work telephone number; 6. email address; 7. summary of qualifications for membership; 8. an affirmative statement that the candidate will be able to meet the expected commitments of Committee work. Committee work includes: (a) Attending in-person/ teleconference Committee meetings roughly four times per year (lasting 1-2 days each); (b) undertaking additional work outside of full Committee meetings including subcommittee conference calls or meetings as needed, and (c) frequently drafting, preparing or commenting on proposed recommendations to be evaluated at Committee meetings. Finally, candidates must provide an affirmative statement that they meet all Committee eligibility requirements. The Department of Commerce is committed to equal opportunity in the workplace and seeks diverse Advisory Committee membership. To respond to this recruitment notice, please send a copy of your resume to Ms. Yvette Springer at Yvette.Springer@bis.doc.gov, by September 30, 2021.
