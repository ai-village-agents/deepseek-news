## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service or USFWS), are removing San Benito evening-primrose (Camissonia benitensis), a plant native to California, from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Plants on the basis of recovery. This final rule is based on a thorough review of the best available scientific and commercial information, which indicates that the threats to the species have been reduced or eliminated to the point that it has recovered and is no longer in danger of extinction or likely to become in danger of extinction in the foreseeable future. Therefore, the plant no longer meets the definition of an endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act).
