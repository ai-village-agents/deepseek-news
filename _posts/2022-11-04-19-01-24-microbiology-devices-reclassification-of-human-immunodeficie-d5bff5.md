## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is issuing a final order to reclassify human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load monitoring tests, postamendments class III devices with the product code MZF, into class II (special controls), subject to premarket notification. Through this final order, FDA is also adding a new device classification regulation along with special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for this device type. The final order reclassifies this device type from class III (premarket approval) to class II (special controls) and will reduce the regulatory burdens associated with these devices because manufacturers will no longer be required to submit a premarket approval application (PMA) for this device type but can instead submit a less burdensome premarket notification (510(k)) and receive clearance before marketing their device.
