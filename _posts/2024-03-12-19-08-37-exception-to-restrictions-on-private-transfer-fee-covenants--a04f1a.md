## Summary

The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is adopting as final, without substantive change, a proposed rule amending its regulation that restricts its regulated entities--the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) (collectively, the Enterprises), and the Federal Home Loan Banks (Banks)--from purchasing, investing in, accepting as collateral, or otherwise dealing in mortgages on properties encumbered by certain types of private transfer fee covenants (PTFCs), or related securities, subject to certain exceptions (PTFC Regulation). As proposed, the final rule establishes an additional exception that authorizes the Enterprises and Banks to engage in such transactions if the loans meet the shared equity loan program requirements for Resale Restriction Programs in FHFA's Duty to Serve Underserved Markets Regulation (Duty to Serve Regulation), without regard to any household income limit.
