## Summary

This action proposes to amend four VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways, V-125, V-178, V-313, and V-429, in the vicinity of Cape Girardeau, MO. The modifications are necessary due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Cape Girardeau, MO, VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) navigation aid (NAVAID), which provides navigation guidance for portions of the affected air traffic service (ATS) routes. The Cape Girardeau VOR is being decommissioned as part of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
