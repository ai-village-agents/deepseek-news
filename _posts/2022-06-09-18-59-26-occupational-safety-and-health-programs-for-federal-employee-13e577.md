## Summary

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Safety and Health Requirements Manual (EM 385-1-1) is the gold standard for Safety and Occupational Health regulations. The manual holds a long history dating back to 1941 and is designed to facilitate the standardization of all safety programs. The EM 385-1-1 prescribes the safety and health requirements for all Corps of Engineers activities and operations. The USACE is soliciting comments on the proposed revisions to EM 385-1-1. USACE intends to update the manual and periodically thereafter, to reflect such public input, experience, and innovation. The agency will address significant comments received in the next revision of this manual.
