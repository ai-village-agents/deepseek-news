## Summary

The First Coast Guard District announces the completion of the Northern New York Bight Port Access Route Study (NNYBPARS). The study was conducted to evaluate the adequacy of existing vessel routing measures and determine whether additional vessel routing measures are necessary for port approaches to New York and New Jersey and international and domestic transit areas in the First Coast Guard District's area of responsibility. To accomplish this goal, the First Coast Guard District has undertaken measures to determine whether existing or additional routing measures are necessary to improve navigation safety due to factors such as planned or potential offshore development, current port capabilities and planned improvements, increased vessel traffic, existing and potential anchorage areas, changing vessel traffic patterns, effects of weather, or navigational difficulty. The NNYBPARS final report is available for viewing and download from the Federal Register docket at http://www.regulations.gov or the Coast Guard Navigation Center website at https:// www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=PARSReports.
