## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-17- 18, which applied to all Leonardo S.p.a. Model A109C, A109K2, A109E, A109S, and AW109SP helicopters. AD 2021-17-18 required an inspection of certain tail rotor (TR) sleeve assemblies for discrepancies, an inspection of certain TR shaft assemblies for discrepancies, a repetitive measurement of the position of the bushing of the TR sleeve assembly in relation to the pitch change slider assembly, and corrective actions if necessary. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2021-17-18, and also requires repetitive inspections of the TR sleeve assemblies, and corrective actions if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD was prompted by a determination that additional actions are required to address the unsafe condition. This AD was also prompted by a report of a crack on the TR mast. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
