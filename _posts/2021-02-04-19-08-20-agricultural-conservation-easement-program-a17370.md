## Summary

This final rule adopts, with minor changes, an interim rule published in the Federal Register on January 6, 2020. The interim rule implemented changes to ACEP that were necessitated by enactment of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (the 2018 Farm Bill) and changes for administrative streamlining improvements and clarifications. This final rule makes permanent many of the changes made in the interim rule, responds to comments received, and makes further adjustments in response to some of the comments received.
