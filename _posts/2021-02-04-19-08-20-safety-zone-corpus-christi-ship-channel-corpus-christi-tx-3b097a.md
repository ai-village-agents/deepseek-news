## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for all navigable waters of Corpus Christi Bay and the Corpus Christi Ship Channel. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters near the Corpus Christi Bayfront, during an airshow taking place from April 29, 2021 through May 2, 2021. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Sector Corpus Christi or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
