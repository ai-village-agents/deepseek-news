## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2006-20-08, which applies to all Embraer S.A. Model EMB-145, -145ER, - 145MR, -145LR, -145XR, -145MP, and -145EP airplanes. AD 2006-20-08 requires repetitive inspections to detect cracking or failure of the rod ends and fittings of the aileron power control actuator (PCA) and corrective actions if necessary, and provides an optional terminating action. Since the FAA issued AD 2006-20-08, it has been determined that there was an error in identifying a maintenance task number. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2006-20-08 and corrects an error in a task number, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
