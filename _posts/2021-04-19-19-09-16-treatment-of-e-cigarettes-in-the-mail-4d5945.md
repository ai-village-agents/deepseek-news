## Summary

A forthcoming final rule will determine whether electronic nicotine delivery systems ("ENDS") may continue to be mailed pursuant to certain statutory exceptions that are currently administered through an application process. To the extent that such exceptions may ultimately be made available for ENDS, this document provides mailers with guidance to assist in preparing exception applications for submission following the final rule. In addition, ENDS mailers are advised to review and comply with all other applicable mailing restrictions and requirements currently in effect for controlled substances, drug paraphernalia, and hazardous materials.
