## Summary

On November 21, 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a new drug application for XCOPRI (cenobamate) tablets. Cenobamate is chemically known as [(1R)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(tetrazol- 2-yl)ethyl] carbamate. Thereafter, the Department of Health and Human Services provided the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) with a scheduling recommendation to place cenobamate in schedule V of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). In accordance with the CSA, as revised by the Improving Regulatory Transparency for New Medical Therapies Act, DEA is hereby issuing an interim final rule placing cenobamate, including its salts, in schedule V of the CSA.
