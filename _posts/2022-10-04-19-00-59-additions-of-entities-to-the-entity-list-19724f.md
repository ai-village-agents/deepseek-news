In response to the Russian Federation's (Russia's) further invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the illegal and unjustifiable basis of which has been furthered by its illegal purported annexation of regions of Ukraine, the Department of Commerce is amending the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by adding 57 entities under 57 entries to the Entity List. These entities have been determined by the U.S. Government to be acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. Of these 57 entities, 56 will be listed on the Entity List under the destination of Russia and one will be listed under the destination of the Crimea Region of Ukraine.
