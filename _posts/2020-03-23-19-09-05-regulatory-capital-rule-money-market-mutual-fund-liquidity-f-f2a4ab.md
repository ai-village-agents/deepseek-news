## Summary

To provide liquidity to the money market sector to help stabilize the financial system, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston to establish the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF), pursuant to section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. Under the MMLF, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston will extend non-recourse loans to eligible financial institutions to purchase certain types of assets from money market mutual funds (MMFs). To facilitate this Federal Reserve lending program, the Board, OCC and FDIC (together, the agencies) are adopting this interim final rule to allow banking organizations to neutralize the regulatory capital effects of participating in the program. This treatment would extend to the community bank leverage ratio.
