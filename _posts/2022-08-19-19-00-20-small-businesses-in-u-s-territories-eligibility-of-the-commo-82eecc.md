## Summary

This direct final rule implements a provision of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Fiscal Year 2021 (FY 2021) by defining a covered territory business as a small business in the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Covered territory businesses would be newly qualified for surplus personal property distributions, and covered territory mentors would receive contracting incentives for mentoring prot[eacute]g[eacute] firms that are covered territory businesses.
