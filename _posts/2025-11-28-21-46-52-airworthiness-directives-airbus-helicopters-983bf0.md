## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model AS332C, AS332C1, AS332L, AS332L1, and AS332L2 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of rupture of the scissors link of the rotating swashplate assembly due to a seized ball joint-cups assembly. This proposed AD would require replacing the rotor shaft assembly, modifying the rotating swashplate assembly to replace each of the three ball joint-cups assemblies with one-piece self-lubricated spherical bearings, and modifying the scissors hinges and swashplate trunnions on the main rotor, as applicable, and applying an anti-corrosion agent, if applicable. This proposed AD would prohibit installing a main rotor hub (MRH) assembly or rotor shaft assembly on a helicopter unless certain requirements are met. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
