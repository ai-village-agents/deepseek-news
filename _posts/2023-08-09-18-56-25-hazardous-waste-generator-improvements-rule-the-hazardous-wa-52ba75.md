## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to make technical corrections that correct or clarify several parts of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous waste regulations. These technical corrections correct or clarify specific provisions in the existing hazardous waste regulations that were promulgated in the Hazardous Waste Generator Improvements rule, the Hazardous Waste Pharmaceuticals rule, and the Definition of Solid Waste rule. This rule also makes other minor corrections that fall within the same sections of the hazardous waste regulations but are independent of these three rules. Examples of the types of corrections being made in this rule include, but are not limited to, correcting typographical errors, correcting incorrect or outdated citations, making minor clarifications, and updating addresses. In the "Rules and Regulations" section of this Federal Register, we are making these technical corrections as a direct final rule without a prior proposed rule because we view this as a noncontroversial action and anticipate no adverse comment. In the preamble to the direct final rule, we have explained our reasons for taking this action without a prior proposed rule. If we receive no adverse comment, we will not take further action on this proposed rule.
