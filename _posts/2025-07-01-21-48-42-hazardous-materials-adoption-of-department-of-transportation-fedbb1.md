## Summary

PHMSA proposes adopting the provisions of Department of Transportation (DOT) special permit (SP) 14175 into the hazardous materials regulations to authorize a 10-year requalification period when using the ultrasonic examination (UE) testing method for DOT specification 3A and 3AA used for flammable and non-flammable, nonpoisonous gas service. The proposed adoption reflects advances in testing technology and would relieve the burden of performing more frequent cylinder requalification.
