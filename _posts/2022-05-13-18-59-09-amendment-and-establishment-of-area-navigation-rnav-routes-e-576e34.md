## Summary

This action amends 3 low altitude United States Area Navigation (RNAV) routes, designated T-224, T-258, T-323, and establishes 9 new low altitude RNAV routes, designated T-404, T-406, T- 410, T-412, T-414, T-423, T-425, T-427, and T-429, in the eastern United States. The routes enhance the efficiency of the National Airspace System (NAS) by expanding the availability of RNAV routing and supporting the transition of the NAS from ground-based to satellite- based navigation, under the VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
