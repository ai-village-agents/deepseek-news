## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the availability of the final revision to the risk determination for the Cyclic Aliphatic Bromide Cluster (HBCD) risk evaluation issued under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The revision to the HBCD risk determination reflects the announced policy changes to ensure the public is protected from unreasonable risks from chemicals in a way that is supported by science and the law. EPA determined that HBCD, as a whole chemical substance, presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health and the environment when evaluated under its conditions of use. In addition, this revised risk determination does not reflect an assumption that all workers always appropriately wear personal protective equipment (PPE). EPA understands that there could be occupational safety protections in place at workplace locations; however, not assuming use of PPE reflects EPA's recognition that unreasonable risk may exist for subpopulations of workers that may be highly exposed because they are not covered by OSHA standards, or their employers are out of compliance with OSHA standards, or because OSHA has not issued a permissible exposure limit (PEL) (as is the case for HBCD). This revision supersedes the condition of use-specific no unreasonable risk determinations in the September 2020 HBCD risk evaluation and withdraws the associated order included in section 5.4.1 of the September 2020 HBCD risk evaluation.
