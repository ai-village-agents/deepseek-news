## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-06- 18, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; A319 series airplanes; A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, -233, -251N, -252N, -253N, -271N, -272N, and -273N airplanes; and A321 series airplanes. AD 2020-06-18 required replacement of affected trimmable horizontal stabilizer actuators (THSAs) with serviceable THSAs. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-06-18, a new Airbus airplane model (A321-253NY) has been certified, on which affected parts could be installed in service. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2020-06-18, revises the applicability to include Model A321-253NY airplanes, and prohibits the installation of affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
