## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A330-200, A330-200 Freighter, A330-300, A330-800, A330-900, A340-200, A340-300, A340-500, and A340-600 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that an A319 airplane lost the right- hand front windshield in flight. Due to the design similarity, this condition can also exist or develop on Model A330 and A340 airplanes. This AD requires repetitive detailed inspections (DET) and electrical test measurements (ETM) of the affected parts and applicable corrective action, and prohibits the installation of affected parts under certain conditions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
