## Summary

The Danny Keysar Child Product Safety Notification Act, section 104 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA), requires the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission or CPSC) to promulgate consumer product safety standards for durable infant or toddler products. Under this statutory direction, the Commission is proposing a safety standard for infant support cushions. The Commission is also proposing to amend CPSC's consumer registration requirements to identify infant support cushions as durable infant or toddler products and proposing to amend CPSC's list of notices of requirements (NORs) to include infant support cushions.
