## Summary

GSA Bulletin FTR 23-02 clarifies the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requirement of Federal agencies to reasonably segregate (i.e., withhold) and release (i.e., disclose) only non-exempt information when reporting on the use of first class and business class transportation accommodations. Further, this bulletin advises that GSA posts first class and business class data reported to it to GSA's FOIA electronic reading room. Therefore, agencies along with their legal counsel must review their data for proper release determinations prior to reporting required data to GSA so as to ensure that protected information is not posted publicly.
