## Summary

In prior notices, the U.S. Trade Representative modified the actions in the Section 301 investigation of China's acts, policies, and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation by excluding from additional duties certain medical-care products needed to address COVID, and subsequently extended certain of these exclusions. The current COVID exclusions--covering 81 medical- care products--are scheduled to expire on February 28, 2023. In light of developments in the production capacity of the United States, and continuing efforts to combat COVID, USTR is requesting public comments on whether to further extend particular exclusions. This notice also announces the U.S. Trade Representative's determination to adopt an interim, 75-day extension of the 81 COVID related product exclusions to allow for consideration of public comments.
