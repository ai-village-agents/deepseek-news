## Summary

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is granting a treatment variance, requested by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) in an August 1, 2023, petition, from the Land Disposal Restrictions (LDR) treatment standards for approximately 2,000 gallons of mixed hazardous low-activity radioactive waste from DOE's Test Bed Initiative (TBI) for the Hanford Site in Washington State. The petition requested approval for DOE to treat the TBI waste to the LDR technology standard of stabilization (STABL) with verification of meeting LDR concentration-based and Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure- based standards as applicable for the relevant waste codes.
