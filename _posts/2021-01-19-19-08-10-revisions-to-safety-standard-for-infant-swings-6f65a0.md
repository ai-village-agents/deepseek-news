## Summary

In November 2012, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) published a consumer product safety standard for infant swings under section 104 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA). The standard incorporated by reference the ASTM voluntary standard that was in effect for infant swings at the time. The CPSIA sets forth a process for updating mandatory standards for durable infant or toddler products that are based on a voluntary standard, when a voluntary standards organization revises the standard. Consistent with the CPSIA update process, the Commission issued a direct final rule in October 2013, to revise the incorporation by reference for the mandatory swings standard, to reflect ASTM'S revised voluntary standard. Since 2013, ASTM has revised the voluntary standard for infant swings three times. This direct final rule updates the mandatory standard for infant swings to incorporate by reference ASTM's 2020 version of the voluntary standard.
