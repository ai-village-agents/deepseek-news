## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted through the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (GA EPD) on July 18, 2024, regarding updates to the State's Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) emissions trading programs. The SIP revision incorporates by reference (IBRs) certain amendments EPA has made to the regulations for the Federal CSAPR trading programs for annual emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) and sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) and the Federal CSAPR trading program for NO<INF>X</INF> emissions during the ozone season from May 1 to September 30, all three of which apply to large electric generating units (EGUs). EPA created these Federal trading programs in 2011 as market-based mechanisms for Georgia and certain other states to address their obligations to downwind states under the Clean Air Act's (CAA's) good neighbor provision with respect to the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) and ground-level ozone. The SIP revision also updates the definition for "Volatile Organic Compound." EPA is proposing to approve Georgia's July 18, 2024, SIP revision because it is consistent with EPA's good neighbor CSAPR trading programs and the CAA.
