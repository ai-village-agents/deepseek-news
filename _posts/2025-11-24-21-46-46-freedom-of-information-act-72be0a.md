## Summary

This proposed rule amends the Defense Nuclear Facilities Board's (the Board or DNFSB) Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) regulations to incorporate certain changes made by the OPEN Government Act of 2007 and the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016. This proposed rule also amends certain provisions to reflect developments in case law and changes in position titles to align with changes made by the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA) and an agency reorganization. The proposed rule is amending a section to permit submission of FOIA requests by electronic mail to the Board or the government-wide portal. This proposed rule also adds multitrack processing which allows the Board to quickly process simple requests. Finally, the proposed rule defines what information should be included in a denial letter.
