## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its spent fuel storage regulations by revising the NAC International, Inc., NAC-UMS Universal Storage System listing within the "List of approved spent fuel storage casks" to renew the initial certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 through 9 of Certificate of Compliance No. 1015. The renewal of the initial certificate of compliance and Amendment Nos. 1 through 9 for 40 years changes the certificate's conditions and technical specifications to address aging management activities related to the structures, systems, and components important to safety of the dry storage system to ensure that these will maintain their intended functions during the period of extended storage operations.
