## Summary

We have submitted a request to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval of a reinstatement of one information collection and renewal of three information collections. The reinstated information collection is prepared by companies and organizations that wish to digitize archival holdings with privately-owned equipment. The first renewal information collection is prepared by organizations that want to make paper-to-paper copies of archival holdings with their personal copiers at the National Archives at the College Park facility. The second renewal is used to advise requesters of the correct procedures to follow when requesting certified copies of records for use in civil litigation or criminal actions in courts of law, and the information to be provided so that records may be identified. The third renewal information collection is used when veterans, dependents, and other authorized individuals request information from or copies of documents in military personnel, military medical, and dependent medical records. We invite you to comment on the proposed information collections.
