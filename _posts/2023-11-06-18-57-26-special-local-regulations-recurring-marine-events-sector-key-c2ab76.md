## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to revise existing regulations by updating the table for existing events in the Seventh Coast Guard District Captain of the Port (COTP) Key West. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters in Key West, FL. Through this notice, the current list of recurring special local regulations is updated with the removal of an event that no longer takes place, the addition of two events, and revisions to existing events. When these special local regulations are enforced, certain restrictions are placed on marine traffic in specified areas. The Coast Guard invites your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
