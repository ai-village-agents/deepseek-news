## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce), in coordination with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), is announcing a new functionality in the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) for importers entering merchandise that is the subject of an antidumping and/or countervailing duty (AD/CVD) certification. Specifically, the capability will exist for importers to identify in the ACE entries that are the subject of an AD/CVD certification. Commerce intends to instruct parties to use this new functionality on a case-by-case basis. This new identification mechanism will facilitate Commerce's and CBP's administration of the AD/CVD laws by making such entry summaries more readily identifiable to Commerce and CBP.
