## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering issuance of an exemption in response to the March 29, 2023, request from Kewaunee Solutions, Inc., (KS) Kewaunee Power Station (KPS), located in Kewaunee County, Wisconsin. The exemption would permit KS to use funds from the KPS nuclear decommissioning trust (NDT) for the management of site restoration activities and allow trust disbursements for site restoration activities to be made without prior notice to the NRC. The NRC staff is issuing an environmental assessment (EA) and finding of no significant impact (FONSI) associated with the proposed exemption.
