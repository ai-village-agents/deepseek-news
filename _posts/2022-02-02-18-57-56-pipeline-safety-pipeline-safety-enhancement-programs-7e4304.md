This notice outlines how PHMSA will review and process Pipeline Safety Enhancement Program (PSEP) requests from pipeline owners and operators (PSEP applicants or applicants) to implement safety-enhancing testing programs for innovative technologies and operational practices on natural gas and hazardous liquid (HL) pipeline facilities. PHMSA will review each PSEP application and provide regulatory oversight of each approved PSEP, in accordance with the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2020 (PIPES Act of 2020), to ensure the safety measures in each achieve a level of safety greater than the level of safety provided by the federal pipeline safety regulations (PSR).
