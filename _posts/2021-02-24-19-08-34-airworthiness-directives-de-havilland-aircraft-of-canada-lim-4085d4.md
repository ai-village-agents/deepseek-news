## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2015-17-08, which applies to certain Bombardier, Inc. Model DHC-8-400 series airplanes. AD 2015-17-08 requires installing new cable assemblies with a pull-down resistor. Since the FAA issued AD 2015-17- 08, a modification has been developed to address all known single point failures that could lead to runaway of the nose wheel steering (NWS) system. This proposed AD would require modifications to the NWS system. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
