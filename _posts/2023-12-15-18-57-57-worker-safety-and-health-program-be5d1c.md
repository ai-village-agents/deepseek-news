## Summary

On September 2, 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE or the Department) published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) for public comment in which it proposed to amend its current worker safety and health program regulation. In this final rule, DOE is adopting the amendments proposed in the NOPR without change. The amendments make corrections to the worker safety and health program regulation requirements related to beryllium and beryllium compounds for purposes of accuracy and consistency with DOE's Chronic Beryllium Disease Prevention Program regulation and clarify that DOE did not intend to adopt the 2016 American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists threshold limit value for beryllium and beryllium compounds. In addition, in this final rule DOE is correcting minor typographical errors identified in the regulation.
