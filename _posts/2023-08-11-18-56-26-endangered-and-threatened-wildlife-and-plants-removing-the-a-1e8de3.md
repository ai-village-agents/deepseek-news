# Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Removing the Apache Trout From the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife

## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service or USFWS), propose to remove the Apache trout (Oncorhynchus apache), a fish native to Arizona, from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife due to recovery. Our review of the best available scientific and commercial data indicates that the threats to the species have been eliminated or reduced to the point that the species no longer meets the definition of a threatened species or an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). If we finalize this rule as proposed, the prohibitions and conservation measures provided by the Act, particularly through section 7 and our regulations would no longer apply to the Apache trout. We request information and comments from the public regarding this proposed rule for the Apache trout.
