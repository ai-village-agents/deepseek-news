## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the availability of a final document titled, "Integrated Science Assessment for Ozone and Related Photochemical Oxidants (Final)" (EPA/ 600/R-20/012). The document was prepared by the Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment (CPHEA) within EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) as part of the review of the primary (health-based) and secondary (welfare-based) ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and represents an update of the 2013 Integrated Science Assessment (ISA) for ozone and related photochemical oxidants. The ISA, in conjunction with additional technical and policy assessments, provides the basis for EPA's decisions on the adequacy of the current NAAQS and the appropriateness of possible alternative standards.
