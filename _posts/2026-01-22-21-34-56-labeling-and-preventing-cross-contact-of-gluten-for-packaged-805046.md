## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) received a citizen petition from Celiac Journey requesting that we act to protect consumers with celiac disease by requiring that all ingredients with gluten be listed by name in the ingredient list and by requiring cross- contact controls with gluten-containing grains. We are issuing this document to request comment on the issues raised in the petition and on specific questions related to these issues.
