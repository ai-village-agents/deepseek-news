# Pentachlorothiophenol (PCTP); Regulation of Persistent, Bioaccumulative, and Toxic Chemicals Under TSCA Section 6(h)

## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency is finalizing a rule under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to address its obligations under TSCA for pentachlorothiophenol (PCTP) (CASRN 133-49-3), which EPA has determined meets the requirements for expedited action under TSCA. This final rule prohibits all manufacturing (including import), processing, and distribution in commerce of PCTP and PCTP-containing products or articles for any use, unless PCTP concentrations are at or below 1% by weight. This rule will result in lower amounts of PCTP being manufactured, processed, and distributed, which will impact the amount that will be available for use or disposal, thus reducing the exposures to humans and the environment.
