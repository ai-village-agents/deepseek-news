## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) announces that the Office of Management and Budget has approved new information collection requirements under OMB Control Number 3060-1334, as adopted in the Federal Communications Commission's Second Report and Order and Order on Reconsideration, FCC 24-121 (Second Report and Order). This Second Report and Order established the specific processing, licensing, and service rules for the voluntary, limited use of FM booster stations to originate content on a permanent basis and initiated the accompanying use of FCC Form 2100, Schedule 336 to notify the Commission of such operations. This document is consistent with the Second Report and Order, which stated that the Commission will publish a document in the Federal Register announcing the effective date for these amended rule sections and revise the rules accordingly.
