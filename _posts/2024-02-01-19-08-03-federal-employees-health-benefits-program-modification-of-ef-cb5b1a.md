## Summary

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) proposes to modify the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) regulations to allow for coverage to take effect as soon as an employee becomes eligible for coverage under the FEHB Program. This rulemaking is also applicable to the Postal Service Health Benefits (PSHB) Program within the FEHB Program. The proposed changes would allow FEHB and PSHB coverage to become effective at the beginning of the pay period that the employee in pay status has an initial opportunity to enroll. This change would occur when the employee becomes eligible for FEHB or PSHB coverage, provided an appropriate request to enroll is received by the employing office within the initial pay period that the employee becomes eligible.
