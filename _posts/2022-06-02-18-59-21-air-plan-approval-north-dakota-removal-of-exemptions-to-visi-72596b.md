## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision it received on November 11, 2016, submitted by the State of North Dakota, through the North Dakota Department of Health (NDDH). The revision was submitted by North Dakota in response to a finding of substantial inadequacy and SIP call published on June 12, 2015, for a provision in the North Dakota SIP related to excess emissions during startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) events. EPA is proposing approval of the SIP revision and proposing to determine that this SIP revision corrects the deficiency identified in the June 12, 2015, SIP call.
