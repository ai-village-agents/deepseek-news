## Summary

We are amending our regulations on creating and maintaining Federal records to explicitly include record-keeping requirements for electronic records. On January 1, 2021, the Federal Records Act was amended. It now requires the Archivist of the United States to promulgate regulations governing Federal agency preservation of electronic messages that are determined to be records. We are amending our regulations to define electronic messages and to expressly state records management requirements for electronic records, including electronic messages.
