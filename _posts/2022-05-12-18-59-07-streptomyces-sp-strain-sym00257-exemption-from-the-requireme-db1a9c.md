## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of Streptomyces sp. strain SYM00257 in or on all food commodities when used in accordance with label directions and good agricultural practices. Indigo Ag, Inc. submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of Streptomyces sp. strain SYM00257 under FFDCA when used in accordance with this exemption.
