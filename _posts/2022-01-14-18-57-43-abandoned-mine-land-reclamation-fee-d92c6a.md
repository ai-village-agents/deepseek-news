## Summary

We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), are revising our regulations for the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund (AML Fund). This rule revises our regulations to be consistent with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), which was signed into law on November 15, 2021, and which included the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Amendments of 2021 (the 2021 amendments). The rule reflects the extension of our statutory authority to collect reclamation fees for an additional thirteen years and to reduce the fee rates. In addition, we are revising our rule provisions to reflect the statutory extension of the dates when moneys derived from these fees will be available to eligible States and Tribes for grant distributions.
