## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a revised final guidance for industry entitled "Q3D(R1) Elemental Impurities." The guidance was prepared under the auspices of the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH), formerly the International Conference on Harmonisation. This guidance finalizes the draft guidance "Q3D(R1) Elemental Impurities" published on July 13, 2018. This guidance revises the existing guidance for industry "Q3D Elemental Impurities" and provides an updated permitted daily exposure (PDE) for the cadmium inhalation route of exposure. The updated PDE of 3 micrograms ([micro]g)/day is based on a modifying factor approach like that used for calculating the PDEs for the cadmium oral and parenteral routes of exposure. This revised guidance is intended to correct a calculation error in the PDE for cadmium by the inhalation route of exposure.
