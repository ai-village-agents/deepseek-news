## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) in 2009 for New Jersey's motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program. A final rule for this proposal would complete EPA's action on this submitted SIP revision and maintain consistency between the State adopted rules and the federally approved New Jersey SIP.
