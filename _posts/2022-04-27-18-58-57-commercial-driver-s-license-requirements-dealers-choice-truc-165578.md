## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to deny the exemption request submitted by the following affiliated driveaway motor carriers: Dealers' Choice Truckaway System, Inc. dba Truckmovers; Irontiger Logistics, Inc.; TM Canada, Inc.; and Victory Driveaway, Inc. These driveaway carriers jointly sought an exemption from the requirement that drivers transporting empty passenger vehicles with seating capacities of 16 or more but a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) and a gross vehicle weight (GVW) of less than 26,001 pounds possess a commercial drivers' license (CDL) to do so. The applicants explain that they are often called on to transport what they describe as minibuses from points of manufacture or distribution to school districts around the country, and that the requirement that drivers hold a CDL to deliver these empty vehicles is an unnecessary restriction that contributes to the driver shortage. FMCSA analyzed the request and public comments and determined that the application provided no evidence that the exemption would ensure a level of safety equivalent to or greater than that achieved absent such exemption.
