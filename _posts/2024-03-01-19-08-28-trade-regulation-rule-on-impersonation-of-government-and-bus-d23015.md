## Summary

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC or Commission) requests public comment on its proposal to amend the trade regulation rule entitled Rule on Impersonation of Government and Businesses (Impersonation Rule or Rule) to revise the title of the Rule, add a prohibition on the impersonation of individuals, and extend liability for violations of the Rule to parties who provide goods and services with knowledge or reason to know that those goods or services will be used in impersonations of the kind that are themselves unlawful under the Rule. The Commission believes these changes are necessary and such impersonation is prevalent, based on all comments it received on the Rule and other information discussed in this document. The Commission now solicits written comment, data, and arguments concerning the utility and scope of the proposed revisions to the Impersonation Rule.
