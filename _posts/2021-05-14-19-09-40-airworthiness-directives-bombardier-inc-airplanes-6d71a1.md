## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-100-1A10 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of a number of low altitude engine surge incidents during takeoff. This AD requires revising the existing airplane flight manual and applicable corresponding operational procedures to provide the flightcrew with procedures to require the engine bleeds to be "ON" during takeoff. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
