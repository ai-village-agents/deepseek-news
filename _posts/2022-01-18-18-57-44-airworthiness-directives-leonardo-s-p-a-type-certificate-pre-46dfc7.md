## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Leonardo S.p.a. (type certificate previously held by Agusta S.p.A.) Model A109A and A109A II helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of internal corrosion on a main rotor (M/R) blade. This AD requires repetitively inspecting affected M/R blades and accomplishing film analysis and repair in accordance with certain approved methods. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
