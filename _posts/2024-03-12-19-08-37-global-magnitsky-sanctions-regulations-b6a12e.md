## Summary

The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is adopting a final rule amending the Global Magnitsky Sanctions Regulations and reissuing them in their entirety to further implement the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act and a December 20, 2017 Executive Order related to human rights and corruption. This final rule replaces the regulations that were published in abbreviated form on June 29, 2018, with a more comprehensive set of regulations that includes additional interpretive guidance and definitions, general licenses, and other regulatory provisions that will provide further guidance to the public. Due to the number of regulatory sections being updated or added, OFAC is reissuing the Global Magnitsky Sanctions Regulations in their entirety.
