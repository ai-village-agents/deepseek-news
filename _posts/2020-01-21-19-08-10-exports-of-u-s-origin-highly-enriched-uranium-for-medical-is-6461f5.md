## Summary

The Secretary of Energy, in accordance with the American Medical Isotopes Production Act of 2012 (AMIPA), issued a certification that there is an insufficient global supply of molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) produced without the use of HEU available to satisfy the domestic U.S. market and that the export of U.S.-origin HEU for the purposes of medical isotope production is the most effective temporary means to increase the supply of Mo-99 to the domestic U.S. market. This certification is effective for no more than two years from the effective date of January 2, 2020.
