## Summary

The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is proposing to exempt certain records maintained by its AssuranceNet (ANet) system of records from the notification and access provisions of Privacy Act of 1974 (Privacy Act). FSIS is proposing these exemptions because the information in the SORN is directly associated with investigations conducted by FSIS for law enforcement purposes. A notice of system of records for USDA/FSIS-0005, AssuranceNet (ANet) is also published in this issue of the Federal Register.
