## Summary

In response to a request from Zhejiang Yuhua Timber Co. Ltd. (Yuhua), A-Timber Flooring Company Limited (A-Timber), and Mullican Flooring Co. (Mullican) (collectively, Yuhua et al.), the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is issuing these preliminary results of the changed circumstances review (CCR) of the antidumping duty (AD) order on multilayered wood flooring (MLWF) from the People's Republic of China (China). Commerce preliminarily determines that the MLWF sold through A-Timber and described below is produced and exported by Yuhua; as such, it is excluded from the AD order. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.
