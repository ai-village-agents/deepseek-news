## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) portion of the Indiana State Implementation Plan (SIP). The state of Indiana is requesting revisions to emission limits at the Northern Indiana Public Service Company Bailly Station (NIPSCO) facility reflecting permanently shut down units. Indiana is also requesting SIP revisions for two facilities formerly owned by ArcelorMittal USA LLC and currently owned by Cleveland-Cliffs LLC (Indiana Harbor East and Indiana Harbor West). The Indiana Harbor East facility is required to demonstrate continuous compliance with final SO<INF>2</INF> emission limits as a daily (24- hour) average. These revisions will result in decreases in allowable SO<INF>2</INF> emissions at all three facilities, maintaining SO<INF>2</INF> attainment/unclassifiable designations for the 2010 1- hour SO<INF>2</INF> national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS).
