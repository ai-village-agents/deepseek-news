## Summary

The Commission will provide a limited opportunity for members of the public to submit additional comments on certain petitions for duty suspensions and reductions. Under the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act of 2016 (the Act), the Commission must submit its preliminary report on the petitions for duty suspensions and reductions that have been filed with it to the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance on June 9, 2020. In that report, the Commission must categorize each petition as either (a) a petition that meets the requirements of the Act with or without modification (Category I, II, III, or IV petitions), (b) a petition that does not contain the information required by the Act or that was not filed by a likely beneficiary (Category V petitions), or (c) a petition that the Commission does not recommend for inclusion in a miscellaneous tariff bill (Category VI petitions). The Commission has decided that it will accept additional comments from the public on any petitions that are listed as Category VI petitions for a ten-day period beginning on June 12, 2020, at 8:45 a.m. As provided below, all such comments must be submitted to the Commission electronically through the Commission website https://mtbps.usitc.gov. The Commission will not accept comments filed in paper form or in any other form or format.
