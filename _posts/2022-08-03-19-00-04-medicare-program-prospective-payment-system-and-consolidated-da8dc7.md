## Summary

This final rule updates payment rates; forecast error adjustments; diagnosis code mappings; the Patient Driven Payment Model (PDPM) parity adjustment; the SNF Quality Reporting Program (QRP); and the SNF Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program. It also establishes a permanent cap policy to smooth the impact of year-to-year changes in SNF payments related to changes in the SNF wage index. We also announce the application of a risk adjustment for the SNF Readmission Measure for COVID-19 beginning in FY 2023. We are finalizing changes to the long-term care facility fire safety provisions referencing the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)[supreg] Life Safety Code, and Director of Food and Nutrition Services requirements.
