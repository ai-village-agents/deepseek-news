## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Embraer S.A. (Embraer) Model EMB-505 airplanes. This AD was prompted by occurrences of an uncommanded change in the setting of the barometric pressure in both primary flight displays (PFDs). This AD requires installing a new version of the airplane avionics system software, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
