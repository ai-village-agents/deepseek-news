## Summary

The Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Fossil Energy (FE) is discontinuing its practice of issuing separate long-term and short- term authorizations for exports of domestically produced natural gas from the same facility (or facilities). DOE is instead establishing a practice that certain long-term authorizations to export domestically produced natural gas--including liquefied natural gas (LNG), compressed natural gas, and compressed gas liquid--include additional authority to export the same approved volume pursuant to transactions with terms of less than two years on a non-additive basis (including non-additive commissioning volumes). By consolidating this authority in a single authorization without any increase in total approved export volumes, this action will streamline DOE's regulatory process and reduce administrative burdens. This policy statement affects only future long- term export authorizations issued by DOE under the Natural Gas Act (NGA). DOE is concurrently issuing a blanket order amending existing export authorizations consistent with this policy statement.
