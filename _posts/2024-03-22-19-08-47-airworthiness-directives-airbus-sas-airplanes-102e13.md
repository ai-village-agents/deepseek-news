## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A300 B4-601, B4-603, B4-620, B4-622, B4-605R, B4-622R, C4-605R Variant F, F4-605R, and F4-622R airplanes, Model A310 series airplanes, Model A318, A319, A320, and A321-series airplanes, Model A330-200, -200 Freighter, and -300 series airplanes, Model A330- 841 and -941 airplanes, and Model A340-211, -212, -213, -311, -312, - 313, -541, and -642 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reported occurrences of chemical oxygen generators failing to activate in service and during maintenance activities. This proposed AD would require replacing affected oxygen generators, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
