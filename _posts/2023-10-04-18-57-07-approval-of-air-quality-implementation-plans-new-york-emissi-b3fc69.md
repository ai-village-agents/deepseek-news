## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted by New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) for the purpose of enhancing an existing emission statement program for stationary sources in New York State. The SIP revision consists of amendments to regulations in New York's Codes, Rules and Regulations (NYCRR) applicable to the emission statements. This SIP revision was submitted by NYSDEC to satisfy the ozone nonattainment provision of the Clean Air Act (Act or CAA). These provisions establish electronic reporting requirements for annual emission statements filed by facilities subject to Title V operating permits of the Act beginning in 2022 (for calendar year 2021 emission reporting). The intended effect is to obtain improved emissions related data from facilities located in New York State, allowing NYSDEC to more effectively plan for, and attain, the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). The Emission Statement rule also improves EPA's and the public's access to facility specific emission related data.
