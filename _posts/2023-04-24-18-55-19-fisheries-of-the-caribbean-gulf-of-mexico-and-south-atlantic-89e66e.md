## Summary

NMFS proposes to implement Amendment 1 to the Puerto Rico Fishery Management Plan (FMP), Amendment 1 to the St. Croix FMP, and Amendment 1 to the St. Thomas and St. John FMP (jointly Amendments 1), as submitted by the Caribbean Fishery Management Council (Council). This proposed rule and Amendments 1 would prohibit the use of buoy gear by the recreational sector in U.S. Caribbean Federal waters and modify the regulatory definition of buoy gear to increase the maximum number of allowable hooks used by the commercial sector in U.S. Caribbean Federal waters from 10 to 25. The purpose of this proposed rule and Amendments 1 is to allow commercial fishermen targeting deep-water fish, including snappers and groupers, in the U.S. Caribbean Federal waters to use buoy gear with up to 25 hooks, while protecting deep- water reef fish resources and habitats and minimizing user conflicts.
