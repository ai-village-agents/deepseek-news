## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is requesting public input on drinking water analytical methods for emerging contaminants in drinking water, particularly those listed on the agency's Fifth Contaminant Candidate List (CCL 5), that might support monitoring under the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule. This notice describes published drinking water analytical methods and EPA drinking water methods currently in development for the CCL and other emerging contaminants, with an expectation that some of these methods will support the sixth Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR 6) and/or other future cycles of the UCMR program. The agency is also announcing a virtual public meeting (via webinar) to discuss potential approaches to developing UCMR 6. The webinar will discuss the following: drinking water analytical methods and contaminants being considered, UCMR 6 sampling design, laboratory approval, and other potential aspects of the monitoring approach. The agenda will include time for brief remarks by participants who pre- register.
