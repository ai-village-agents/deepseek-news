## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-24-06 for certain Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Model BR700- 710A1-10, BR700-710A2-20, and BR700-710C4-11 engines. AD 2022-24-06 required initial and repetitive visual inspections of certain low- pressure compressor (LPC) rotor (fan) disks and replacement of any LPC rotor (fan) disk with cracks detected. AD 2022-24-06 also allows for modification of the engine in accordance with RRD service information as a terminating action to these inspections. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-24-06, the manufacturer published updated service information and revised the engine maintenance manual (EMM) to provide instructions for an improved ultrasonic inspection method, which prompted this AD. This AD requires initial and repetitive visual inspections of certain LPC rotor (fan) disks and replacement of any LPC rotor (fan) disk with cracks detected and would allow modification of the engine as a terminating action to the inspections, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
