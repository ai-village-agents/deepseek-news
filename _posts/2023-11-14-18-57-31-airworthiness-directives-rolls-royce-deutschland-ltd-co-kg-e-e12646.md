## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-21-13 for certain Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Model Trent 1000 engines. AD 2021-21-13 required the operator to revise the airworthiness limitation section (ALS) of their existing approved aircraft maintenance program (AMP) by incorporating the revised tasks of the applicable time limits manual (TLM) for each affected model engine. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-21-13, the manufacturer has revised the TLM, introducing new and more restrictive instructions. This AD is prompted by the manufacturer revising the engine TLM life limits of certain critical rotating parts. This AD requires revisions to the ALS of the operator's existing approved AMP, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
