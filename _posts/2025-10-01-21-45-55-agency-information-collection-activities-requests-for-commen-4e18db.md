## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for a renewal of an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on June 2nd, 2025. The collection involves a public form on the faa.gov website to streamline how stakeholders' questions are answered in a timely manner. Specifically, the Contact Customer Support form allows the public and other stakeholders to ask the FAA questions, as well as get the appropriate answer or information they need to operate their UAS or drone safely. The information to be collected will be used to and/or is necessary because it allows the UAS Integration Office to collect the appropriate information about the stakeholder's name, preferred method of communications email address, phone number, zip code, type of flyer that would allow the Support Center Analysts to more efficiently answer the customer's specific question.
