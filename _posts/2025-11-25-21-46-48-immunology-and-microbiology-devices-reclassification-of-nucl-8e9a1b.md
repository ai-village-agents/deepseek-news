## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to reclassify certain postamendments class III nucleic acid-based test systems indicated for use with a corresponding approved oncology therapeutic product (product codes OWD, PJG, PQP, and SFL) from class III (premarket approval) into class II (special controls), subject to premarket notification. FDA is also proposing a new device classification regulation, along with the special controls that FDA believes are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for these devices.
