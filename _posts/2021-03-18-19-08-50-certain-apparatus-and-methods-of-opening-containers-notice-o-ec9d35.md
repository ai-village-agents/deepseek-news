Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on January 28, 2021, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of Draft Top, LLC of Long Branch, New Jersey. Supplements to the complaint were filed on February 12 and 19 and March 1 and 2, 2021. The complaint, as supplemented, alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain apparatus and methods of opening containers by reason of infringement of a claim of U.S. Patent No. 10,519,016 ("the '016 patent"). The complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The complainant requests that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a general exclusion order, or in the alternative a limited exclusion order, and cease and desist orders.
