## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary moving safety zone around the M/V ZHEN HUA 26 while it transits through the Port of Los Angeles--Long Beach, CA, to Long Beach Container Terminal (LBCT), LB Berth E22, then to Fenix Marine Services (FMS), LA Berth 302. This safety zone is necessary to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards associated with oversized cargo transfer operations of four ship-to-shore gantry cranes and one rubber tire gantry crane, which will extend more than 200 feet out from the transiting vessels. Entry of persons or vessels into this safety zone is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port (COTP) Los Angeles--Long Beach, or their designated representative.
