## Summary

The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration is correcting a final rule that was published in the Federal Register on April 10, 2024. The final rule was published to maintain alignment with international regulations and standards by adopting various amendments, including changes to proper shipping names, hazard classes, packing groups, special provisions, packaging authorizations, air transport quantity limitations, and vessel stowage requirements. The corrections address several errors to the hazardous material entries in the hazardous materials table.
