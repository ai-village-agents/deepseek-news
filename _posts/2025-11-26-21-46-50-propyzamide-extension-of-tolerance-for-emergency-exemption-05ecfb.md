## Summary

This regulation extends the time-limited tolerance for residues of propyzamide in or on cranberry for an additional three-year period. The time-limited tolerance expires on December 31, 2028. This action is in response to EPA's granting of an emergency exemption under section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) authorizing use of this pesticide. In addition, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) requires EPA to establish a time- limited tolerance or exemption from the requirement for a tolerance for pesticide chemical residues in food that will result from the use of a pesticide under an emergency exemption granted by EPA under FIFRA.
