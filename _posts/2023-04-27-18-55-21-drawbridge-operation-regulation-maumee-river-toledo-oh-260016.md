# Drawbridge Operation Regulation; Maumee River, Toledo, OH

## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to modify the operating schedule that governs the CSX Railroad Bridge, mile 1.07, the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad Bridge, mile 1.80, the Craig Memorial Bridge, mile 3.30, the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Bridge, mile 4.30, and the Norfolk Southern Railroad Bridge, mile 5.76, all over the Maumee River at Toledo, Ohio. The original regulation was published in 1986 and has been amended over the years but a full review of the regulations for the waterway has not been completed. The current regulations are cumbersome, difficult to understand, and cause confusion to recreational vessels and some drawtenders. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
