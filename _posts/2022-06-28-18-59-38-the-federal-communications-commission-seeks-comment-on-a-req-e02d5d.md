## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission's Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (WTB) and Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau (PSHSB) issue this Public Notice seeking comment on a joint filing by certain automakers, state departments of transportation, and equipment manufacturers requesting a waiver of the Commission's rules governing intelligent transportation system (ITS) operations to permit them to deploy Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) technology immediately in the upper 30 megahertz (5.895-5.925 GHz) portion of the 5.850-5.925 GHz Band (5.9 GHz Band). Importantly, the waiver seeks authority to deploy C-V2X technology before the Commission renders its final decision on the rules for the technical and logistical parameters of C-V2X that will ultimately govern ITS operations in the band. The Public Notice provides specific information about the waiver request as well as instructions on how to submit comments in the docket and the schedule for doing so.
