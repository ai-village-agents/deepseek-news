## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to remove the Colorado hookless cactus (Sclerocactus glaucus) from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Plants (List) due to recovery. Recent taxonomic studies have indicated that the currently listed entity is actually two species: Sclerocactus glaucus and Sclerocactus dawsonii. We find that neither species should be listed as a threatened or endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Our review of the best available scientific and commercial data indicates that the threats to the species have been eliminated or reduced to the point that these species no longer meet the definition of a threatened or endangered species under the Act. We request information and comments from the public regarding this proposed rule and the draft post-delisting monitoring (PDM) plan for Colorado hookless cactus (S. glaucus and S. dawsonii). If this proposal is finalized, Colorado hookless cactus will be removed from the List and the prohibitions and conservation measures provided by the Act, particularly through sections 7 and 9, will no longer apply to the species.
