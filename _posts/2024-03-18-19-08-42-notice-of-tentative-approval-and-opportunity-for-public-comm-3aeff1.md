## Summary

Notice is hereby given that the State of Delaware is revising its approved Public Water System Supervision Program. Delaware has adopted drinking water regulations for the Stage 1 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproduct Rule. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined that Delaware's Stage 1 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproduct Rule meets all minimum Federal requirements, and that it is no less stringent than the corresponding Federal regulation. Therefore, EPA has tentatively decided to approve the State program revisions.
