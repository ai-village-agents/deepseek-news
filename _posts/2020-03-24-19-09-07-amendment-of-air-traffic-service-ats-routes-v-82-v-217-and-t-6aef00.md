## Summary

This action changes the effective date of a final rule published in the Federal Register on February 21, 2020, amending VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-82 and V-217, and area navigation (RNAV) route T-383 in the vicinity of Baudette, MN. The ATS route amendments were due to the planned decommissioning of the Baudette VOR. The FAA is delaying the effective date to coincide with the expected completion of the Minnesota Department of Transportation (DOT) purchase and flight check of a new Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) facility to support the Instrument Landing System (ILS) or Localizer (LOC) Approach to Runway (RWY) 31 instrument approach procedure, which is affected by the loss of the Baudette VOR, at Warroad International Memorial Airport, MN.
