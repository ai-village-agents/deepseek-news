## Summary

With the issuance of this final order, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration is permanently placing N-ethyl-2- (2-(4-isopropoxybenzyl)-5-nitro-1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)ethan-1-amine (other name: N-desethyl isotonitazene) and 2-(4-ethoxybenzyl)-5-nitro- 1-(2-(piperidin-1-yl)ethyl)-1H-benzimidazole (other names: N- piperidinyl etonitazene; etonitazepipne), including their isomers, esters, ethers, salts, and salts of isomers, esters, and ethers whenever the existence of such isomers, esters, ethers, and salts are possible within the specific chemical designation, in schedule I under the Controlled Substances Act. This scheduling action discharges the United States' obligations under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961). This action imposes permanent regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions applicable to schedule I controlled substances on persons who handle (manufacture, distribute, import, export, engage in research or conduct instructional activities with or possess), or handle N-desethyl isotonitazene and N-piperidinyl etonitazene.
