## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing year four of the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) Development and Readiness Pilot (CDRP). This program facilitates the expedited CMC development of products under an investigational new drug application (IND) based on the anticipated clinical benefit of earlier patient access to the products. FDA has implemented this pilot program to assist with CMC readiness for products regulated by both the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) that have accelerated clinical development timelines. To accelerate CMC development and facilitate CMC readiness, the pilot features increased communication between FDA and sponsors and explores the use of science- and risk-based regulatory approaches, as applicable. This notice outlines the eligibility criteria and process for submitting a request to participate in the pilot.
