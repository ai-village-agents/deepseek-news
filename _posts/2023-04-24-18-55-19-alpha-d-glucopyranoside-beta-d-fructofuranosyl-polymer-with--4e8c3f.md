## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of [alpha]-D-glucopyranoside, [beta]-D- fructofuranosyl, polymer with methyloxirane and oxirane with a minimum number average molecular weight (in amu) of 9,800 (CAS Reg. No. 26301- 10-0) when used as an inert ingredient in a pesticide chemical formulation. Delta Analytical Corporation, on behalf of Borchers Americas, Inc. submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of [alpha]-D- glucopyranoside, [beta]-D-fructofuranosyl, polymer with methyloxirane and oxirane on food or feed commodities when used in accordance with this exemption.
