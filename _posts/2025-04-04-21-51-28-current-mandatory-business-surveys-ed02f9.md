## Summary

The Bureau of the Census (Census Bureau) will conduct the following current four mandatory business surveys in 2025: Annual Integrated Economic Survey; Annual Business Survey; Business and Professional Classification Report; and Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey. We have determined that data collected from these surveys are needed to aid the efficient performance of essential governmental functions and have significant application to the needs of the public and industry. The data derived from these surveys, most of which have been conducted for many years, are not publicly available from nongovernmental or other governmental sources.
