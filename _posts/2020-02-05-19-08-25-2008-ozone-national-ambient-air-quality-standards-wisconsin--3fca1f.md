## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing two actions related to the attainment date for two areas classified as "Moderate" for the 2008 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). First, EPA is proposing to determine that the Inland Sheboygan, Wisconsin (WI) nonattainment area attained the standard by the July 20, 2019, extended attainment date. Second, EPA is proposing to determine that the Shoreline Sheboygan, WI nonattainment area failed to attain the standard by the extended attainment date. The effect of failing to attain by the attainment date is that the area will be reclassified by operation of law to "Serious" upon the effective date of the final reclassification action. Consequently, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) must submit State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions required to satisfy the statutory and regulatory requirements for Serious areas for the 2008 ozone NAAQS. EPA is proposing deadlines for submittal of those SIP revisions and implementation of the related control requirements.
