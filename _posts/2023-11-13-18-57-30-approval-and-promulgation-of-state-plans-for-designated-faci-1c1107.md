## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a Clean Air Act (CAA) section 111(d) plan submitted by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) on October 18, 2021. This state plan was submitted to fulfill the requirements of the CAA and is responsive to EPA's promulgation of Emissions Guidelines and Compliance Times for municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills. The Alabama state plan establishes emission limits for existing MSW landfills and provides for the implementation and enforcement of those standards and requirements.
