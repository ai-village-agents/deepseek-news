## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Engine Alliance (EA) Model GP7270, GP7272, and GP7277 engines. This AD was prompted by a manufacturer investigation that revealed that certain high-pressure turbine (HPT) interstage seals were manufactured from material suspected to contain iron inclusion. This AD requires replacement of the affected HPT interstage seals. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
