## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Airbus Helicopters Model AS350B, AS350B1, AS350B2, AS350B3, AS350BA, AS350D, AS355E, AS355F, AS355F1, AS355F2, AS355N, AS355NP, EC130B4, and EC130T2 helicopters; and Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (AHD) Model EC135P1, EC135P2, EC135P2+, EC135P3, EC135T1, EC135T2, EC135T2+, EC135T3, MBB-BK 117 C-2, MBB-BK 117 D-2, and MBB-BK 117 D-3 helicopters. This AD was prompted by a supplier report of a non- conformity occurring during production. This AD requires removing certain flight control Flexball cables from service and prohibits installing those flight control Flexball cables on any helicopter, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also requires reporting certain information. The FAA previously sent an emergency AD to all known U.S. owners and operators of these helicopters. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
