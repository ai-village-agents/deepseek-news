## Summary

The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) amends the Common Crop Insurance Regulations, Sugar Beet Crop Insurance Provisions. This rule will reinstate stage guarantees and make the stage removal option permanent to ensure all producers have maximum flexibility to obtain the crop insurance coverage they need for their operation. The changes will be effective for the 2023 and succeeding crop years for counties with a contract change date on or after November 30, 2022, and for the 2024 and succeeding crop years for counties with a contract change date prior to November 30, 2022.
