## Summary

NMFS intends to revise regulations concerning the Certification of Admissibility (COA) program used to allow entry of certain fish or fish products otherwise subject to trade restrictions. Specifically, NMFS is considering automating the submission of COA information through use of the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) managed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Such automated processing may require the submission of additional data elements. Prior to drafting a proposed rule, NMFS is issuing this advance notice of proposed rulemaking requesting input from stakeholders and interested parties on the reporting and recordkeeping burden of the certification of admissibility, on the procedures for using certification in the entry filing process, and on ways to reduce the reporting burden and expedite release of admissible shipments through use of the ACE single window portal. Based on comments received and NMFS' overall assessment of concerns raised, NMFS will consider these concerns in developing the proposed rule to revise and automate the submission of COA information.
