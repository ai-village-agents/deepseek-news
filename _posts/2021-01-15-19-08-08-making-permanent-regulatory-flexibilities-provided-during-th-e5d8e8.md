## Summary

To provide Americans with expanded access to certain medical devices to respond to the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, FDA issued guidance documents providing numerous regulatory flexibilities, including a temporary waiver of premarket notification requirements under section 510(k) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. For seven class I devices for which 510(k) premarket review as temporarily waived during the PHE, the Department of Health and Human Services is permanently exempting those seven (7) class I devices from the 510(k) requirement and is also proposing to exempt an additional 83 class II devices and 1 unclassified device class from the 510(k) requirement, for which premarket review had also been waived during the PHE. The Department is soliciting the public's views on whether premarket review should be permanently waived for some or all of these 83 devices and views on ways to improve the 510(k) premarket notification program.
