## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain ATR-GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42 airplanes and Model ATR72 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of interference and chafing between a propeller brake hydraulic pipe and an electrical wire bundle bracket screw installed in the underwing box of the right-hand (RH) engine nacelle. This AD requires modification of the electrical wiring routing in the engine nacelles, a one-time detailed visual inspection (DVI) of the propeller brake hydraulic pipe and electrical wire bundle bracket screw head in the underwing box of the RH engine nacelle and, depending on findings, accomplishment of applicable corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
