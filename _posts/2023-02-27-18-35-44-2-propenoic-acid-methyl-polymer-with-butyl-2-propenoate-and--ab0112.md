## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of 2-propenoic acid, methyl-, polymer with butyl 2-propenoate and methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate compd. with 2- amino-2-methyl-1-propanol when used as an inert ingredient in a pesticide chemical formulation. Nouryon Chemicals LLC submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of 2-propenoic acid, methyl-, polymer with butyl 2- propenoate and methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate compd. with 2-amino-2- methyl-1-propanol on food or feed commodities when used in accordance with these exemptions.
