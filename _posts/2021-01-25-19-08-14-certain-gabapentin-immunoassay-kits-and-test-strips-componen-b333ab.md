Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on December 2, 2020, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of ARK Diagnostics, Inc. of Fremont, California. A supplement to the complaint was filed on December 2, 2020 and an amended complaint was filed on December 23, 2020. The complaint, as amended, alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain gabapentin immunoassay kits and test strips, components thereof, and methods therefor by reason of infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 8,828,665 ("the '665 patent") and U.S. Patent No. 10,203,345 ("the '345 patent").
