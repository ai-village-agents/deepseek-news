## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to amend certain Great Lakes Pilotage regulatory requirements to align with current Coast Guard and U.S. pilot association operations and pilotage practices. This proposed rule would clarify the different phases of training and types of registrations for pilots who work on the Great Lakes, eliminate outdated practices and redundant requirements, and adds much needed structure regarding the billing dispute process.
