## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announces the availability of the second Draft Long-Term Management and Storage of Elemental Mercury Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (Draft Mercury Storage SEIS-II, DOE/EIS-0423-S2D) for public comment. As required by the Mercury Export Ban Act of 2008 and the 2016 Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (all together referred to as MEBA), DOE proposes to identify an existing facility or facilities for the long-term management and storage of elemental mercury generated within the United States. To this end, DOE issued the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Long-Term Management and Storage of Elemental Mercury (Mercury Storage EIS, DOE/EIS-0423, January 2011) and the first Final Long-Term Management and Storage of Elemental Mercury Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (Mercury Storage SEIS, DOE/EIS-0423-S1, September 2013), which analyzed reasonable alternatives, in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), for locating and developing such a facility. On May 24, 2021, DOE announced its intent to prepare a second supplement to the Mercury Storage EIS to update these previous analyses of potential environmental impacts and analyze additional alternatives, in accordance with NEPA.
