## Summary

We are amending the regulations governing the National Poultry Improvement Plan (NPIP). These amendments, among other things, condition indemnity for low pathogenicity avian influenza on adherence to biosecurity plans, clarify existing provisions of the regulations, fix editorial errors, and align the regulations more closely with current producer practices. These changes were voted on and approved by the voting delegates at the NPIP's 2022 National Plan Conference.
