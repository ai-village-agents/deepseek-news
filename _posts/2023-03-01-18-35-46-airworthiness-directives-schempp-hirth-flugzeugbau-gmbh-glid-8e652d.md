## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Schempp-Hirth Flugzeugbau GmbH Model Duo Discus and Duo Discus T gliders. This AD was prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as the airbrake becoming blocked or jammed in an extended position during high airspeed due to an incorrect adjustment on the airbrake system. This AD requires repetitively inspecting the airbrake system and taking corrective action as necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
