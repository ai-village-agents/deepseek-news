## Summary

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB or Bureau) proposes revisions to certain provisions of Regulation B, subpart B, implementing changes to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act made by section 1071 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Bureau is reconsidering coverage of certain credit transactions and financial institutions; the small business definition; inclusion of certain data points and how others are collected; and the compliance date. The CFPB believes these proposed changes would streamline the rule, reduce complexity for lenders, and improve data quality, advancing the purposes of section 1071 and complying with recent executive directives.
