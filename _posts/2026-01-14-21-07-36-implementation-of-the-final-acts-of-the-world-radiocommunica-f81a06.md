## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission or FCC) modifies the United States Table of Frequency Allocations (U.S. Table) in the Commission's rules to implement certain spectrum allocation decisions from the International Telecommunication Union's World Radiocommunication Conference's 2015 Final Acts, including those for amateur radio, satellite services, and for aural broadcast auxiliary and television broadcast auxiliary stations by revising the Commission's rules. These changes provide for increased domestic utilization of a range of spectrum in both satellite and terrestrial contexts.
