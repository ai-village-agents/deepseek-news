## Summary

The Department of Commerce (Commerce) is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) blends from the People's Republic of China (China). The period of review is August 1, 2019, through July 31, 2020. We are rescinding the review with respect to all companies for which we received a request for administrative review, except for PureMann, Inc (PureMann). Commerce preliminarily finds that the sole remaining company subject to this administrative review, PureMann, is part of the China-wide entity because it did not file a separate rate application (SRA). We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.
