## Summary

This Federal Register Notice (FRN) serves as notice of the adoption of STRL personnel demonstration project flexibilities by an STRL comprised of certain organizations within the U.S. Army Futures Command (AFC), known collectively as the AFC STRL. The organizations comprising the AFC STRL are the U.S. Army Futures Command Headquarters and Headquarters Components (AFC HHC); the Futures and Concepts Center (FCC); Cross Functional Teams (CFTs); The Research and Analysis Center (TRAC); the Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC) Headquarters (also known as DEVCOM Headquarters); and the DEVCOM Analysis Center (DAC). The AFC STRL will adopt with some modifications, personnel demonstration project flexibilities implemented by the Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC) Army Research Laboratory (ARL); CCDC Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Center (C5ISR); the Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI); the CCDC Armament Center (AC); the Technical Center (TC), U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC); and the Joint Warfare Analysis Center (JWAC). Most flexibilities and administrative procedures are adopted without changes. However, modifications were made when necessary to address specific management and workforce needs. In addition, changes were made based on current law, best practices, and administrative guidance.
