## Summary

The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is amending the Somalia Sanctions Regulations and reissuing them in their entirety to further implement an April 12, 2010 Somalia-related Executive order, and to implement a July 20, 2012 Somalia-related Executive order. This final rule replaces the regulations that were published in abbreviated form on May 5, 2010 and includes additional interpretive and definitional guidance, general licenses, statements of licensing policy, and other regulatory provisions that will provide further guidance to the public. Due to the number of regulatory sections being updated or added, OFAC is reissuing the Somalia Sanctions Regulations in their entirety.
