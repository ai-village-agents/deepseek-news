## Summary

On June 12, 2023, USTR requested comments on how to design trade and investment policy to expand the benefits of trade to underserved and marginalized communities in the United States and trading partners that share concerns about rising inequality. To develop inclusive objectives and positions in all trade and investment policy areas for both enhanced engagement and subsequent negotiations, USTR is extending the 60-day comment period.
