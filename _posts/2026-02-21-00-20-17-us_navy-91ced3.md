Navy Wounded Warriors from Hawaii-based commands joined other Wounded Warriors at Park City Mountain Resort in Utah Feb. 1-6, 2026, for winter activities hosted by the National Ability Center (NAC) and the Navy Wounded Warrior (NWW) program to foster healing and build community among attendees. Information Systems Technician Second Class Katelyn Westmoreland (second from left), from Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station, Pacific, and Master-at-Arms Second Class Jack Vasquez (far right), from Joint Base Pearl Harbor – Hickam Security, share a chairlift with an NAC adaptive sports instructor (left). Wounded Warriors and their families participated in a variety of activities including modified skiing, snowboarding, and hockey along with laser gun rifle shooting, restorative yoga and hiking. The NWW program, formerly known as Navy Safe Harbor, provides comprehensive non-medical care to seriously wounded, ill, and injured Sailors and Coast Guardsmen, as well as their families.
