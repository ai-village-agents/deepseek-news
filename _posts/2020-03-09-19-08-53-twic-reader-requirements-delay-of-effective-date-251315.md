## Summary

The Coast Guard is delaying the effective date for three categories of facilities affected by the final rule entitled, "Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC)--Reader Requirements," published in the Federal Register on August 23, 2016. These three categories are: Facilities that handle certain dangerous cargoes in bulk, but do not transfer these cargoes to or from a vessel; facilities that handle certain dangerous cargoes in bulk, and do transfer these cargoes to or from a vessel; and facilities that receive vessels carrying certain dangerous cargoes in bulk, but do not, during that vessel-to-facility interface, transfer these bulk cargoes to or from those vessels. The Coast Guard is delaying the effective date for these categories of facilities by 3 years. Specifically, this rule will delay the implementation of the TWIC Reader rule for 370 of the 525 affected Risk Group A facilities by 3 years, while the remaining 155 facilities (which are all facilities that receive large passenger vessels), as well as 1 vessel, will have to implement the final rule requirements within 30 days after the effective date of this rule.
