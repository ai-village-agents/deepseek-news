# Cable Service Change Notifications; Modernization of Media Regulation Initiative; Retransmission Consent

## Summary

In this document, the Commission seeks comment on whether to update our rules concerning notice that cable operators must provide to subscribers and local franchise authorities (LFAs) regarding service or rate changes in order to reduce potential consumer confusion. Specifically, we seek comment whether to amend the rules to make clear that cable operators must provide subscriber notice "as soon as possible" when service changes occur due to retransmission consent or program carriage negotiations that fail within the last 30 days of a contract. We also seek comment on whether to require notice to LFAs only if required by the LFA pursuant to its statutory authority and whether to adopt several technical edits to the rules to make them more readable and remove duplicative requirements.
