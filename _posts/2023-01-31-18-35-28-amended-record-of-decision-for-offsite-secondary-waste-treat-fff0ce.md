## Summary

This is an amendment to the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) 2013 Record of Decision (ROD) for the Final Tank Closure and Waste Management Environmental Impact Statement for the Hanford Site, Richland, Washington (DOE/EIS-0391, December 2012) (TC&WM EIS). In accordance with DOE's implementing procedures for the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), DOE prepared a supplement analysis (DOE/EIS-0391-SA-03; SA), which evaluated DOE's proposal to transport and treat certain solid and liquid secondary wastes at licensed and permitted commercial treatment facilities off the Hanford Site. DOE also proposes to potentially dispose of some of these secondary wastes (after treatment) offsite at a licensed and permitted commercial disposal facility. This action would be implemented on an interim basis until such time as an enhanced onsite treatment capability is available for Direct-Feed Low-Activity Waste (DFLAW) operations (estimated to be approximately 10 years). This amended ROD addresses the differences in the planned management of secondary wastes from that addressed by the 2013 TC&WM EIS ROD document.
