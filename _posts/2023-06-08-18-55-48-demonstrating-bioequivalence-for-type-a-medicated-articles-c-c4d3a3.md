## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry (GFI) #279 entitled "Demonstrating Bioequivalence for Type A Medicated Articles Containing Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient(s) Considered To Be Poorly Soluble in Aqueous Media, That Exhibit Little to No Systemic Bioavailability, and Are Locally Acting; Draft Guidance for Industry." This draft guidance describes an approach to satisfy the requirements for the completion of the Bioequivalence technical section for generic Type A medicated articles (TAMAs) containing poorly soluble, locally acting, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) that have little to no systemic absorption, and for which blood level studies are not considered appropriate to demonstrate product bioequivalence. The suggested approach described in this draft guidance uses a combination of in vitro and in vivo data to support a determination of bioequivalence to address the unique challenges associated with demonstrating bioequivalence of TAMAs containing poorly soluble, locally acting APIs that have little to no systemic absorption.
