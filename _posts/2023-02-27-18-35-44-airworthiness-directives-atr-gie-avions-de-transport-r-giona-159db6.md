## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-20- 09, which applied to certain ATR--GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR72 airplanes. AD 2021-20-09 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. This AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive tasks and airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2021-20-09 and requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate additional new or more restrictive tasks and airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
