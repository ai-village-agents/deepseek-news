## Summary

HRSA's Federal Office of Rural Health Policy (FORHP) utilizes clear, consistent, and data-driven methods of defining rural areas in the United States for the purposes of determining eligibility for its rural health grant programs. FORHP monitors ongoing national research and, as appropriate, considers updates to its definition. Because access to needed health care is likely to be reduced when roads are most difficult to traverse, with this notice, FORHP proposes to modify the definition of rural areas by integrating the new Road Ruggedness Scale (RRS) released in 2023 by the Economic Research Service (ERS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which characterizes topographic variability, or ruggedness, of roads. This proposal does not impact rural areas included in the current FORHP definition. This notice seeks public comment on FORHP's proposal. This notice also includes a technical clarification explaining how FORHP will use Census data to identify outlying Metropolitan Statistical Area counties that qualify as rural in future updates given the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Census terminology changes that removed the categories of Urban Clusters and Urbanized Areas.
