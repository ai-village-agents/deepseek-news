## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, have received an application from the Wind Energy Condor Action Team (WECAT) for an incidental take permit under the Endangered Species Act. The permit, if granted, would authorize take of the federally endangered California condor (Gymnogyps californianus), incidental to otherwise lawful activities associated with the operation of WECAT members' separate wind energy projects. Available for comment are the draft conservation plan that WECAT prepared in support of their application, and a draft environmental assessment, which we have prepared pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. We invite comments from the public and Federal, Tribal, State, and local governments. We will take comments into consideration before deciding whether to issue an incidental take permit.
