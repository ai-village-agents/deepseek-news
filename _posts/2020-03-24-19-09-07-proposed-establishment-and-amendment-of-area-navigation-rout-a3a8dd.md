**Published:** February 05, 2026 19:09 UTC

## Summary

This action proposes to establish 19 new high altitude area navigation (RNAV) routes (Q-routes), and modify 13 existing Q-routes, in support of the Northeast Corridor Atlantic Coast Route (NEC ACR) Project. This proposal would improve the efficiency of the National Airspace System (NAS) by expanding the availability of RNAV routing and reducing the dependency on ground-based navigational systems.
