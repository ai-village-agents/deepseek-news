## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is proposing to revoke 23 standards of identity for food. FDA is taking this action because we tentatively conclude that these standards are no longer necessary to promote honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers. This proposed action would reduce redundant regulatory requirements.
