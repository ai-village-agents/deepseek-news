## Summary

In accordance with the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA or the Act), notice is given of a proposed consent decree to address lawsuits filed by the South Coast Air Quality Management District, East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice, People's Collective for Environmental Justice, and Sierra Club (collectively, "Plaintiffs") in the United States District Court for the Central District of California: South Coast Air Quality Management District, East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice, People's Collective for Environmental Justice, and Sierra Club v. U.S. EPA and Michael Regan, in his official capacity, No. 2:23-cv-02646-JLS-PD (C.D. Cal.) and consolidated case (No. 2:23-cv-03545-JLS-PD). Plaintiffs filed complaints alleging that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) failed to perform certain non-discretionary duties in accordance with the Act to take final action on a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of California. EPA is providing notice of this proposed consent decree, which would resolve all claims in the case by establishing a deadline for EPA to take final action as specified in the decree.
