## Summary

The Coast Guard is issuing this final rule to adopt the 2022 interim rule removal of an incorrect statement in the Code of Federal Regulations about field preemption of State or local regulations regarding inland navigation. The incorrect language was added by a 2014 final rule, and the error was subsequently discovered. By adopting the removal of this language, this rule clarifies the ability of States to regulate inland navigation as they have historically done. This rule does not require States to take any action.
