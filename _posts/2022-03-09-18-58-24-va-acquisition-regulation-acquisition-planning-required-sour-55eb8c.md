## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is proposing to amend and update its VA Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) in phased increments to revise or remove any policy superseded by changes in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), to remove procedural guidance internal to VA into the VA Acquisition Manual (VAAM), and to incorporate any new agency specific regulations or policies. This rulemaking revises coverage concerning Acquisition Planning, Required Sources of Supplies and Services, Market Research, and Small Business Programs, as well as affected parts to include Definitions of Words and Terms, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Contract Financing, Solicitation Provisions and Contract Clauses, and Forms.
