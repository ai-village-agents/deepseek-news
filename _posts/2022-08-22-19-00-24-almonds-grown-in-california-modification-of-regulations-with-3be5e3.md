## Summary

The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) withdraws a proposed rule recommended by the Almond Board of California (Board) that would have amended administrative requirements in the California Almond Marketing Order's (Order) roadside stand exemption, credit for market promotion activities, quality control, exempt dispositions, and interest and late charges provisions. In addition, the rule proposed to stay two sections of the administrative requirements that define almond butter and stipulate disposition in reserve outlets by handlers established under the Order. After reviewing and considering the comments received, the proposed rule is being withdrawn.
