## Summary

NMFS has determined that three exempted fishing permit (EFP) applications warrant further consideration and is requesting public comment on those applications and on the Pacific Fishery Management Council's (Council) recommendations following its September 2021 meeting. The EFP applicants request an exemption from a prohibition on the use of unauthorized gear to harvest highly migratory species (HMS) under the Fishery Management Plan for U.S. West Coast Fisheries for Highly Migratory Species (HMS FMP). The purpose of this exemption is to test the effects and efficacy of using new or alternative gear types to harvest swordfish and other HMS off of the U.S. West Coast.
