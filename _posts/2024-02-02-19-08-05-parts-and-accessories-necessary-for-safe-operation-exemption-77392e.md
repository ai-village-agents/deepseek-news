## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to provisionally renew Stoneridge, Inc.'s (Stoneridge) exemption, which will allow motor carriers to operate commercial motor vehicles (CMV) with the company's MirrorEye\TM\ Camera Monitor System (CMS) installed as an alternative to the two rear-vision mirrors required by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs). The exemption is renewed for 5 years, unless revoked earlier.
