## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the issuance of one, and revocation of three, Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) (the Authorizations) issued to STS Lab Holdco (a subsidiary of Amazon.com Services LLC) ("STS"). FDA issued one Authorization under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), as requested by STS, for the Amazon Real-Time RT-PCR DTC Test for Detecting SARS-CoV-2. The Authorization contains, among other things, conditions on the emergency use of the authorized product. The Authorization follows the February 4, 2020, determination by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) that there is a public health emergency that has a significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens living abroad, and that involves the virus that causes COVID-19, and the subsequent declaration on February 4, 2020, that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detection and/or diagnosis of the virus that causes COVID-19, subject to the terms of any authorization issued under the FD&C Act. The Authorization, which includes an explanation of the reasons for issuance, is listed in this document, and further information can be accessed on FDA's website from the links indicated. FDA is also announcing the subsequent revocation of the Authorization issued to STS for the Amazon Real-Time RT-PCR DTC Test for Detecting SARS-CoV-2. In addition, FDA is announcing the revocation of the Authorizations issued to STS for the Amazon Multi- Target SARS-CoV-2 Real-Time RT-PCR DTC Test and Amazon Multi-Target SARS-CoV-2 Real-Time RT-PCR Test. FDA issued and revoked the Authorizations under the FD&C Act. The revocations, which include an explanation of the reasons for each revocation, are reprinted in this document.
