## Summary

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) is issuing this procedural rule to update its Rules of Practice for Adjudication Proceedings (Rules of Practice). This rule expands the opportunities for parties in adjudication proceedings to conduct depositions. It also contains various amendments regarding timing and deadlines, the content of answers, the scheduling conference, bifurcation of proceedings, the process for deciding dispositive motions, and requirements for issue exhaustion, as well as other technical changes. Overall, the amendments will provide the parties with earlier access to relevant information and also foster greater procedural flexibility, which should ultimately contribute to more effective and efficient proceedings. The Bureau welcomes comments on this rule, and the Bureau may make further amendments if it receives comments warranting changes.
