## Summary

The Department of Energy (DOE) publishes a final rule to make technical and administrative changes as a result of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) revisions to its regulations on Grants and Agreements. The changes are required in order to align DOE's regulations with the revised OMB regulations and to remove reference to an expired statutory cost share pilot program. The final rule also makes technical changes to correct pre-existing numbering errors in the regulatory text.
