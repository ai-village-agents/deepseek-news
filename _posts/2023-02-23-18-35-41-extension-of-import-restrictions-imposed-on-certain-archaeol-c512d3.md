## Summary

This document amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regulations to reflect an extension of import restrictions on certain archaeological material of Belize. The Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States Department of State (Department of State), has determined that conditions continue to warrant the imposition of import restrictions and that no cause for suspension exists. The restrictions, originally imposed by CBP Dec. 13- 05, will be extended for an additional five-year period through February 23, 2028, and the CBP regulations are being amended to reflect this extension. CBP Dec. 13-05 contains the Designated List of archaeological materials from Belize to which the restrictions apply.
