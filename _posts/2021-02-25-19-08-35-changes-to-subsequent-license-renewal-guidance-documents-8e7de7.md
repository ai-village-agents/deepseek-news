## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing three Interim Staff Guidance (ISG) documents that update aging management criteria for mechanical, structural, and electrical structures and components in the NRC's subsequent license renewal (SLR) guidance documents. Specifically, the ISGs revise guidance contained in NUREG- 2191, "Generic Aging Lessons Learned for Subsequent License Renewal (GALL-SLR) Report," and NUREG-2192, "Standard Review Plan for Review of Subsequent License Renewal Applications for Nuclear Power Plants." These ISGs are intended to facilitate preparation of SLR applications by clarifying existing guidance for aging management and adding new guidance, which also will facilitate the NRC staff's review of SLR applications.
