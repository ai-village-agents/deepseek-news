## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to modify an exclusion from the lists of hazardous waste previously granted to American Chrome and Chemical (Petitioner), in Corpus Christi, Texas. This action responds to a petition for amendment to exclude (or "delist") up to 1,450 cubic yards per year of K006 chromic oxide solids from the list of federal hazardous wastes when disposed of in an on-site surface impoundment in lieu of disposal in a Subtitle D Landfill. The Agency is proposing to grant the petition based on an evaluation of waste-specific information provided by the petitioner.
