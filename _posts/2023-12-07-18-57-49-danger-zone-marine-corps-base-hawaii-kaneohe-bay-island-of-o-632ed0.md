## Summary

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is proposing to amend the regulations for the existing danger zone at the U.S. Marine Corps Ulupau Crater Weapons Training Range in the vicinity of Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. The U.S. Marine Corps requested a change to the hours that weapons firing may occur. These regulations are necessary to protect the public from potentially hazardous conditions which may exist as a result from use of the areas by the U.S. Marine Corps.
