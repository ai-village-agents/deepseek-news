## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, are initiating 5-year status reviews under the Endangered Species Act, as amended, for 13 northeastern species. A 5-year status review is based on the best scientific and commercial data available at the time of the review. We are requesting submission of any such information that has become available since the previous 5-year status review for each species.
