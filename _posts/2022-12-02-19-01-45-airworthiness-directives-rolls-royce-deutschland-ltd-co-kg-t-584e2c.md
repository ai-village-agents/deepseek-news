## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) BR700-710A1-10, BR700-710A2-20, and BR700-710C4-11 model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by reports of cracks on certain low-pressure compressor (LPC) rotor (fan) disks. This AD requires initial and repetitive visual inspections of certain LPC rotor fan disks and, depending on the results of the inspections, replacement of any LPC rotor fan disk with cracks detected. This AD also allows modification of the engine in accordance with RRD service information as a terminating action to these inspections, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference (IBR). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
