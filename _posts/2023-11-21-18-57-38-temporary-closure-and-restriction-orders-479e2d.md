## Summary

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) proposes to modernize and streamline how the agency notifies the public of temporary closure and restriction orders; clarify that the BLM may issue temporary closure or restriction orders to implement management responsibilities, avoid conflicts among public land users, and ensure the privacy of Tribal activities for traditional or cultural use; require that all orders specify the date and time that a temporary closure or restriction becomes effective and terminates; and make the penalties for violating temporary closure and restriction orders consistent with current statutory authority.
