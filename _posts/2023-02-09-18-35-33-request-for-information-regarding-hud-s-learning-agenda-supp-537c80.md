## Summary

Developing and using rigorous research and relevant evidence is essential for HUD's mission of creating strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality, affordable homes for all. In March 2022, HUD published its first Department-wide HUD Learning Agenda: FY 2022-2026 (the "Learning Agenda"), identifying the Department's priority learning and evidence needs and proposing research, evaluation, and data linkage projects to address those needs. The Learning Agenda covers a period of five years, with an annual review and update process. Through this Request for Information (RFI), HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R) seeks public input regarding potential additions and adjustments to the Department's published Learning Agenda to reflect changes in learning priorities since March 2022. Information provided in response to this RFI will inform the development of the "Learning Agenda Supplement: Fiscal Year 2023" that HUD will publish to accompany the 2022-2026 Learning Agenda to document updates to the Department's priority learning needs.
