## Summary

The EPA Safer Choice program is accepting submissions for its 2020 Safer Choice Partner of the Year Awards. EPA developed the Partner of the Year Awards to recognize the leadership contributions of Safer Choice partners and stakeholders who, over the past year, have shown achievement in the design, manufacture, selection, and use of products with safer chemicals, which furthers outstanding or innovative source reduction. All Safer Choice stakeholders and program participants in good standing are eligible for recognition. Interested parties who would like to be considered for this award should submit to EPA information about their accomplishments and contributions during 2019. There is no form associated with this year's application. Award winners will be recognized at a Safer Choice Partner of the Year Awards ceremony that is being planned for in the Fall of 2020.
