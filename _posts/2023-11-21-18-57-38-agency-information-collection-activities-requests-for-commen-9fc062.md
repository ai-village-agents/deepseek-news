## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves information necessary to submit a Means of Compliance or Declaration of Compliance for Unmanned Aircraft with Remote Identification to the FAA. The collection also involves information necessary to label Unmanned Aircraft that have an FAA- accepted Declaration of Compliance. The information to be collected will be used by the FAA to determine compliance with the requirements for submission of a Means of Compliance or Declaration of Compliance, as well as determine compliance with the Unmanned Aircraft labeling requirements.
