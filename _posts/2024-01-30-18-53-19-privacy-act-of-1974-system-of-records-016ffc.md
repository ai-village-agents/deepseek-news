## Summary

Pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, the Department of the Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Office of Chief Information Officer (OCIO) and Infrastructure and Operations (IOO) is issuing a public notice of its intent to create a Privacy Act System of Records titled "Active Directory (a component of the Local Area Network (LAN) File Server system--LFS)". The purpose of the LFS is to provide the infrastructure needed to support internal HUD systems locally at all HUD locations. This technology includes Active Directory. Active Directory (AD) stores information about objects on the network and makes this information easy for administrators and users to find and use. Active Directory uses a structured data store as the basis for a logical, hierarchical organization of directory information. The information in Active Directory originates from the Digital Identity and Access Management System (DIAMS).
