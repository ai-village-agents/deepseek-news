## Summary

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) seeks approval for a one- time study to examine familial outcomes 8 or more years after a child's adoption from the child welfare system. The primary objective of this study is to estimate the prevalence of instability events that occur in families who have adopted children who have exited the foster care system. The second objective is to understand risk and protective factors associated with post adoption instability.
