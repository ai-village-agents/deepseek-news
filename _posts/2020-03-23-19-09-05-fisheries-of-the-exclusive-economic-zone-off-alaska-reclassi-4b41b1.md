## Summary

The North Pacific Fishery Management Council submitted Amendment 121 to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area (BSAI FMP) and Amendment 110 to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA FMP) (collectively Amendments 121/110), to the Secretary of Commerce for review. If approved, Amendments 121/110 would reclassify sculpins in these fishery management plans (FMPs) under the ecosystem component (EC) category. This action is necessary to ensure sculpin species are accurately classified in the FMPs based on the best available scientific information. Amendments 121/110 are intended to promote the goals and objectives of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the FMPs, and other applicable laws.
