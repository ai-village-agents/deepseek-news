## Summary

As a result of these expedited sunset reviews, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) finds that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) orders on fine denier polyester staple fiber (fine denier PSF) from the People's Republic of China (China), India, the Republic of Korea (South Korea), and Taiwan would likely lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping at the levels indicated in the "Final Results of Sunset Reviews" section of this notice.
