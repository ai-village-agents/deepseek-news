## Summary

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Mississippi Valley Division, New Orleans District (CEMVN), is announcing its intent to prepare a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) to re- evaluate impacts associated with the Amite River and Tributaries (ART), Louisiana, East Baton Rouge (EBR) Watershed Flood Risk Management Project (EBR FRM) in East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana. The EBR FRM project was previously studied in the July 1995 ART, Louisiana, EBR Parish Watershed Flood Risk Management Project Feasibility Study and EIS. Since the initial 1995 impact assessment was conducted, the project area has transitioned from a rural setting with large amounts of undeveloped land, to a more densely populated urban setting containing subdivisions, buildings, and roadways with greater runoff of water during storm events. Due to these changed conditions, the proposed work in these waterways will be designed to convey flows that occur during more frequent but less intense storm events, compared to the storm events that were considered in the original plan addressed in the 1995 EIS. These factors lead to requiring a reassessment of environmental impacts.
