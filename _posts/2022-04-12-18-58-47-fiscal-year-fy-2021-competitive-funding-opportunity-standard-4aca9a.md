## Summary

The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) announces the opportunity to apply for a total of $1,000,000 of Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Technical Assistance and Workforce Development Program funds for projects that develop interoperable standards for Bus Exportable Power Systems (BEPS). BEPS enable public transportation agencies, communities, and States to access resilient and flexible power options through bus fleet vehicles during major power disruptions. Communities and States often need options for generating power immediately after natural disasters. BEPS technologies developed under previous FTA research grants may have the ability to address this type of challenge by transforming hybrid electric and fuel cell buses into mobile power generators. The goal of this program is to develop national interoperable BEPS standards--working with FTA, industry stakeholders and technical partners--so that different manufacturers' systems can use the same technology base and applications for BEPS solutions. One or more projects will be competitively selected based on the criteria outlined in this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO).
