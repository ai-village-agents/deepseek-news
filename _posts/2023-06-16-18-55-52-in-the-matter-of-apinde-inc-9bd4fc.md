## Summary

On May 11, 2023, the NRC staff issued an Order revoking APINDE Inc's NRC license, effective 30 days from the date of the Order, due to a determination that the license was issued based on inaccurate information and in consideration that APINDE Inc. does not have a qualified Radiation Safety Officer (RSO). The license has been suspended since August 22, 2019, when the NRC staff, through an investigation by the NRC's Office of Investigations, first identified sufficient cause that the license had been issued based on inaccurate information and that APINDE Inc's RSO was not qualified. In a September 10, 2019, letter, the APINDE Inc. President/CEO acknowledged errors in the license application and stated that corrective actions would be taken. Beyond this written response, APINDE Inc. did not take any steps to restore the requisite reasonable assurance that operations could be conducted in compliance with the Commission's requirements and that the health and safety of the public would be protected.
