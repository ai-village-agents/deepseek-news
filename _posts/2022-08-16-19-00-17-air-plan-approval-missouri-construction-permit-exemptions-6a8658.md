## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve revisions to the Missouri State Implementation Plan (SIP) received on June 10, 2021. The submission revises Missouri's regulation on construction permit exemptions. These revisions update incorporations by reference, remove unnecessary words, and make minor clarifications and grammatical changes. These revisions do not impact the stringency of the SIP or have an adverse effect on air quality. The EPA's approval of this rule revision is being done in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
