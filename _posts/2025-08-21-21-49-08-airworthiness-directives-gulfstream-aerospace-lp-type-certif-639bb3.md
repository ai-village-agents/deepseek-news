## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Gulfstream Aerospace LP Model Gulfstream 100, Astra SPX, and 1125 Westwind Astra airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that new airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new airworthiness limitations. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
