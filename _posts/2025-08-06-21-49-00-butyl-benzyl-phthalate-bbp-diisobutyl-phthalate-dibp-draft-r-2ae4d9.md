## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is announcing the availability of and seeking public comment on the draft risk evaluations under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for Butyl Benzyl Phthalate (BBP) (CARSN 85-68-7) and Diisobutyl Phthalate (DIBP) (CASRN 84-69-5). The purpose of risk evaluations under TSCA is to determine whether a chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment under the conditions of use, including unreasonable risk to potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations identified as relevant to the risk evaluation by EPA, and without consideration of costs or non-risk factors. EPA used the best available science to prepare this draft risk evaluation and to preliminarily determine, based on the weight of scientific evidence, that BBP and DIBP pose unreasonable risk to health and the environment driven primarily by certain conditions of use analyzed in the draft risk evaluations.
