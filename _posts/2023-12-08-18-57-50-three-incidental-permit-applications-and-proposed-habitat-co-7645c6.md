## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, are reopening the comment periods on notices announcing three incidental take permit applications, three proposed habitat conservation plans, and related documents. We are taking this action because of a disruption in the public's access to regulations.gov as a means of viewing documents and submitting comments when the three notices were initially published. We invite comments from the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies. If you already submitted a comment, you do not need to resubmit it.
