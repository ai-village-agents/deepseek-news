## Summary

This proposed rule would implement the provision of the 21st Century Cures Act specifying that a health care provider determined by the HHS Inspector General to have committed information blocking shall be referred to the appropriate agency to be subject to appropriate disincentives set forth through notice and comment rulemaking. In particular, this rulemaking would establish for such health care providers a set of appropriate disincentives using authorities under applicable Federal law.
