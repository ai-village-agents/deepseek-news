## Summary

FMCSA proposes amendments to its regulations governing the annual registration fees that participating States collect from motor carriers, motor private carriers of property, brokers, freight forwarders, and leasing companies for the Unified Carrier Registration (UCR) Plan and Agreement for the 2025 registration year and subsequent registration years. The fees for the 2025 registration year would be increased above the fees for the 2024 registration year by an average of 25.0 percent overall, with varying increases between $9 and $9,000 per entity, depending on the applicable fee bracket. The proposal is based upon a recommendation from the UCR Plan.
