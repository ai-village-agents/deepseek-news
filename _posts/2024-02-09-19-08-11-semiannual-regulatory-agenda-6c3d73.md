This agenda provides summary descriptions of regulations being developed by the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council in compliance with Executive Order 12866 "Regulatory Planning and Review," as reaffirmed and amended in Executive Order 13563, "Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review," and Executive Order 14094, "Modernizing Regulatory Review." This agenda is being published to allow interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process. Additionally, members of the public can track the progress of any open and pending FAR rule via the "Open FAR Cases" report, which is publicly available at https://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/far_case_status.html. The Regulatory Secretariat Division has attempted to list all regulations pending at the time of publication, except for minor and routine or repetitive actions; however, unanticipated requirements may result in the issuance of regulations that are not included in this agenda. There is no legal significance to the omission of an item from this listing. Also, the dates shown for the steps of each action are estimated and are not commitments to act on or by the dates shown. Published proposed rules may be reviewed in their entirety at the Government's rulemaking website at https://www.regulations.gov.
