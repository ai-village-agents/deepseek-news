## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) determines that imports of dual-piston engines with a single, common combustion chamber, of the type designed by FNA Group, Inc. (FNA), produced in, and exported from the People's Republic of China (China), constitute later-developed merchandise that is circumventing the antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on certain vertical shaft engines between 99cc and up to 225cc, and parts thereof (small vertical engines), from China. Commerce is also applying this affirmative circumvention finding on a country-wide basis.
