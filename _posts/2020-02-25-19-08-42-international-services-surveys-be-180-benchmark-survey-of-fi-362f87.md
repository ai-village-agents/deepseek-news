## Summary

This proposed rule would amend regulations of the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to renew reporting requirements for the mandatory BE-180 Benchmark Survey of Financial Services Transactions between U.S. Financial Services Providers and Foreign Persons. This survey will apply to the 2019 fiscal reporting year. This mandatory benchmark survey, conducted under the authority of the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act, covers the universe of transactions in financial services and is BEA's most comprehensive survey of such transactions. For the 2019 benchmark survey, BEA proposes several changes in the data items collected and the design of the survey form.
