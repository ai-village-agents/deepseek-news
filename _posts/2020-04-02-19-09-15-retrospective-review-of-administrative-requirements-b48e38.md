## Summary

On February 4, 2020, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requested input from its licensees and members of the public to identify outdated or duplicative administrative requirements that may be eliminated without an adverse effect on public health or safety, common defense and security, protection of the environment, or regulatory efficiency and effectiveness. The public comment period originally was scheduled to close on April 6, 2020. The NRC has decided to extend the public comment period to allow more time for members of the public to develop and submit their comments.
