## Summary

The ASD(HA) is issuing this final rule to revise the definition of drafts, currently defined as paper instruments, within the regulation governing the WIC Overseas Program. This final rule modernizes the definition of drafts to include not only paper instruments but also other methods and processes, including electronic benefit transfers. The rule is being published as a final rule as the change to the definition of drafts involve only a minor, technical amendment to the existing regulation. The Department has determined that notice and comment would be unnecessary and contrary to public interest.
