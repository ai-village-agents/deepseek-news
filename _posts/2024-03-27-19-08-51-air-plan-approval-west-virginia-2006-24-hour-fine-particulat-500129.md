## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve, under the Clean Air Act (CAA), two limited maintenance plans (LMPs) submitted by the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (WVDEP), on behalf of the State of West Virginia. The LMPs are revisions to West Virginia's state implementation plan (SIP) and address the Charleston, West Virginia area (Charleston Area) and the West Virginia portion of the Steubenville-Weirton, Ohio-West Virginia area (West Virginia portion of the Steubenville-Weirton Area). EPA is proposing to approve the Charleston Area LMP and the West Virginia portion of the Steubenville-Weirton Area LMP because they provide for the maintenance of the 2006 24-hour fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) through the end of the second 10-year maintenance periods. In addition, EPA is initiating the process to find the LMPs adequate for transportation conformity purposes.
