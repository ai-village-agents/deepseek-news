## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Leonardo S.p.a. Model A109, A109A, A109A II, A109C, A109K2, A109E, A109S, and AW109SP helicopters modified by Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) SR01812LA. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of certain floats not deploying due to a faulty plunger assembly. This proposed AD would require repairing or replacing certain float assemblies. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
