# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model EC120B, EC130B4, and EC130T2 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a missing retaining ring between the supply hose and the central supply coupling of an emergency floatation system (EFS) inflation assembly. This proposed AD would require inspecting for the presence of the retaining ring in an EFS with certain inflation assemblies installed and, depending on the results, taking corrective action. This proposed AD would also prohibit installing an EFS with those inflation assemblies installed. These actions are specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
