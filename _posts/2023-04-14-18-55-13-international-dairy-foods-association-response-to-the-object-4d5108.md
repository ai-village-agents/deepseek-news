## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) published a final rule entitled "Milk and Cream Products and Yogurt Products; Final Rule To Revoke the Standards for Lowfat Yogurt and Nonfat Yogurt and To Amend the Standard for Yogurt," on June 11, 2021 (the 2021 final rule). The International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) objected to the final rule's provision that yogurt have either a titratable acidity of not less than 0.7 percent, expressed as lactic acid, or a pH of 4.6 or lower before the addition of bulky flavoring ingredients. We are denying IDFA's request for a public hearing with respect to this objection and are issuing a final order to modify the final rule's provision with respect to both pH and titratable acidity.
