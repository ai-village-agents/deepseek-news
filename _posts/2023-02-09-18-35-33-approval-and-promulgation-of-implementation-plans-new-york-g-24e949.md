## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the State of New York for ozone concerning the control of volatile organic compounds. The SIP revision consists of amendments to regulations in New York's Codes, Rules and Regulations (NYCRR) applicable to gasoline dispensing sites and transport vehicles. This revision includes regulatory amendments that eliminate Stage II requirements and strengthen requirements for Stage I vapor recovery systems at gasoline dispensing facilities, and that require that transport vehicles meet current Federal United States Department of Transportation (DOT) requirements. The intended effect of this action is to approve control strategies, required by the Clean Air Act, which will result in emission reductions that will help attain and maintain national ambient air quality standards for ozone and will reduce volatile organic compounds throughout the State. This action is being taken pursuant to the Clean Air Act. The EPA proposed to approve this rule on November 1, 2022, and received no comments.
