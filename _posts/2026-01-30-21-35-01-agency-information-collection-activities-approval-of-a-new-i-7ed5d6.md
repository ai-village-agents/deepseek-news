## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FMCSA announces its plan to submit the Information Collection Request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval. On September 29, 2025, FMCSA issued an interim final rule to restore the integrity of the commercial driver's license (CDL) issuance processes by significantly limiting the authority for SDLAs to issue and renew non-domiciled commercial learner's permits (CLPs) and CDLs to individuals domiciled in a foreign jurisdiction. That interim final rule included a new collection of information, OMB Control Number: 2126-0087, "Non-Domiciled Commercial Driver's License Records," which was approved by OIRA in September 2025 on an emergency basis. That emergency approval expires on February 28, 2026. FMCSA will submit this information collection request for a full three-year approval.
