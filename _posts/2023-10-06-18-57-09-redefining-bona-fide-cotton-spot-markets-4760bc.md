## Summary

On August 1, 2023, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) published a rule amending the regulation that redefines two of the seven designated spot markets and changing the names of the affected markets. The amendatory language in this rule did not provide instructions necessary to effectuate the changes in the Code of Federal Regulations. This action corrects the names and definitions of the two affected cotton spot markets.
