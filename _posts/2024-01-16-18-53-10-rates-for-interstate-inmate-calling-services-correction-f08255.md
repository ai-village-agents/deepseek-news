## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (Commission) published a document in the Federal Register of January 3, 2024, announcing that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) had approved, for a period of three years, an information collection associated with the Commission's 2022 ICS Order, FCC 22-76 (September 30, 2022). The document incorrectly announced an effective date for an amendment published on December 9, 2022, which triggered its codification into the CFR on December 21, 2023. This document establishes the applicability of OMB's approval, published on January 3, 2024.
