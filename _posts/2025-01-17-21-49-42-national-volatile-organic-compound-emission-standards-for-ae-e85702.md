## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing amendments to the National Volatile Organic Compound Emission Standards for Aerosol Coatings. This action revises national emission standards for the aerosol coatings (aerosol spray paints) category under the Clean Air Act (CAA), which requires control of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from certain categories of consumer and commercial products for purposes of reducing VOC emissions contributing to ozone formation and ozone nonattainment. The regulation employs a relative reactivity-based approach to control aerosol coating products' contribution to ozone formation by encouraging the use of less reactive VOC ingredients in formulations. In this final rule, the EPA is updating coating category product-weighted reactivity (PWR) limits, adding new compounds and reactivity factors, updating existing reactivity factors, revising the rule's default reactivity factor, amending thresholds for VOC regulated by the rule, amending reporting requirements, updating test methods to reflect more recent versions, adding a new compliance date, and making clarifying edits.
