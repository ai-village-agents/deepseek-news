This regulation establishes time-limited tolerances for residues of sodium salt of acifluorfen in or on beet, sugar, roots and beet, sugar, leaves. This action is in response to EPA's granting of emergency exemptions under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) authorizing use of the pesticide on sugarbeets. This regulation establishes a maximum permissible level for residues of sodium salt of acifluorfen in or on these commodities. These time- limited tolerances expire on December 31, 2024.
