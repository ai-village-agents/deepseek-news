## Summary

On December 12, 2016, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") published a final rule that added a test procedure for uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs) to the existing DOE test procedure for battery chargers. This document corrects an error in the amended regulatory text as it appeared in the December 2016 final rule. Neither the error nor the correction in this document affect the substance of the rulemaking or any conclusions reached in support of the final rule.
