## Summary

As a result of the determinations by the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) in their five-year (sunset) reviews that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on certain hardwood plywood products (hardwood plywood) from the People's Republic of China (China) would likely lead to the continuation or recurrence of dumping and countervailable subsidies, and material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation of these AD and CVD orders.
