## Summary

DOT finalizes amendments to update the collection and processing of aviation traffic data in the Origin--Destination Survey of Airline Passenger Traffic (O&D). As part of this action, DOT is expanding the number of reporting air carriers, the sample size collected, and the scope of the data collected. Additionally, DOT is changing the timing of the release of the Form 41, Schedule T100 "Air Carrier Traffic and Capacity Data by Nonstop Segment and On-Flight Market" and Schedule T100(f) "Foreign Air Carrier Traffic Data by Nonstop Segment and On-flight Market." These changes will align the current O&D with modern industry business and accounting practices, enable cost savings, reduce burden through automation, and provide enhanced utility for users of the data.
