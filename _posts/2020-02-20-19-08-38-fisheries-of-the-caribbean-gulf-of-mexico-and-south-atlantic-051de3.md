## Summary

NMFS issues regulations to implement management measures described in a framework action to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf), as prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council). This final rule modifies the red snapper Federal charter vessel/headboat (for- hire) component's annual catch target (ACT) for the 2020 and subsequent fishing years. The purpose of this final rule and the framework action is to allow for greater harvest of red snapper by the Federal for-hire component while continuing to constrain landings to the Federal for- hire component and total recreational annual catch limits (ACL).
