## Summary

In response to the Burmese military coup that overthrew the democratically-elected government of Myanmar (Burma), in this final rule, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to apply more restrictive treatment to exports and reexports to, and transfers within, Burma of items subject to the EAR. This action advances the U.S. Government's efforts to reduce the availability of items to Burma's military and security services.
