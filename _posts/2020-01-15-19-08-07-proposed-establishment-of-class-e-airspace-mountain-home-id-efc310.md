## Summary

This action proposes to establish Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface at Mountain Home Municipal Airport, Mountain Home, ID. The first area is proposed to extend upward from 700 feet above the surface. The second area is proposed to extend upward from 1,200 feet above the surface. The establishment of the Class E airspace will support a new area navigation (RNAV) approach procedure and provide properly sized airspace for the airport's current RNAV approach and IFR departures. This action would ensure the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at the airport.
