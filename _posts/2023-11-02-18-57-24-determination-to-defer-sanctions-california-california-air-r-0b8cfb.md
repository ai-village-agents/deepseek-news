## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is making an interim final determination that the California Air Resources Board (CARB) has submitted a rule and other materials that correct deficiencies in its Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act") state implementation plan (SIP) provisions concerning emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from vapor recovery systems of gasoline cargo tanks. This determination is based on a proposed approval, published elsewhere in this Federal Register, of CARB's California Code of Regulations, Title 17, Division 3, Chapter 1, Subchapter 8, Article 1, Section 94014 ("Section 94014") which regulates this source category. The effect of this interim final determination is that the imposition of sanctions that were triggered by a previous limited disapproval by the EPA in 2022 is now deferred. If the EPA finalizes its approval of CARB's submission, relief from these sanctions will become permanent.
