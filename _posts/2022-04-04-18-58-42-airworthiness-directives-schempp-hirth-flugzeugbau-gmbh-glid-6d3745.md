## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Schempp-Hirth Flugzeugbau GmbH Model Janus, Mini-Nimbus HS-7, Nimbus-2, and Standard Cirrus gliders. This AD was prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI describes the unsafe condition as a disconnected pendulum elevator. This AD requires installing colored markings and revising the existing aircraft flight manual (FM) and service manual (SM). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
