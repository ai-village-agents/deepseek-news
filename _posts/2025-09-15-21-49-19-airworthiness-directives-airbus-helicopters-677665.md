# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-19-13, which applies to all Airbus Helicopters Model AS355E, AS355-F, AS355-F1, AS355F2, AS355N, and AS355NP helicopters. AD 2022- 19-13 requires incorporating into existing maintenance records certain requirements (airworthiness limitations). Since the FAA issued AD 2022- 19-13, a determination was made that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would require revising the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the existing maintenance manual (MM) or instructions for continued airworthiness (ICAs) and the existing approved maintenance or inspection program, as applicable. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
