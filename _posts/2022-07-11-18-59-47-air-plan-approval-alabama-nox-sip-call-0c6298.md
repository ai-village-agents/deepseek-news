## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Alabama, through the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM), in a letter dated October 18, 2021. The revision includes corrections to deficiencies to Alabama's regulation titled "NO<INF>X</INF> Budget Program Monitoring and Reporting" (AL NO<INF>X</INF> SIP Call Monitoring Rule), which EPA previously conditionally approved into the SIP. Specifically, the AL NO<INF>X</INF> SIP Call Monitoring Rule establishes monitoring and reporting requirements for units subject to the nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) SIP Call, including alternative monitoring options for certain sources of NO<INF>X</INF>. EPA is also taking final action to convert the conditional approval to a full approval. In addition, EPA is approving other minor changes into the SIP.
