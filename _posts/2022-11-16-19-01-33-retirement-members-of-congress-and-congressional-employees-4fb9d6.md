## Summary

The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing this rule to amend the CFR for purposes of ensuring these regulations reflect the provisions enacted under the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 ("2012 Act") and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 ("2013 Act"). The 2012 Act made significant changes to the retirement benefits of Members of Congress (Members) or congressional employees who are first covered by the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) after December 31, 2012. The 2012 Act decreased the FERS benefit accrual rate used in the FERS annuity calculation for congressional employees or Members first covered by FERS (or reelected with less than five years of FERS service) after December 31, 2012. The 2012 Act also increased the FERS employee contributions by 1.8 percentage points for Members first covered by FERS (or reelected with less than five years of FERS-covered service) after December 31, 2012. Enactment of the 2013 Act, further increased the FERS employee deductions by an additional 1.3 percentage points for all FERS-covered employees first covered by FERS after December 31, 2013 (or rehired/ reelected with less than five years of FERS-covered service), including Members and congressional employees. OPM's proposed rule amends the CFR to reflect these changes.
