## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of Washington, through the Department of Ecology on November 12, 2019. The revisions were submitted by Washington in response to EPA's June 12, 2015 "SIP call" in which EPA found a substantially inadequate Washington SIP provision providing affirmative defenses that operate to limit the jurisdiction of the Federal court in an enforcement action related to excess emissions during startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) events. EPA's approval of the SIP revisions removes the substantially inadequate provision which corrects the deficiency identified in the 2015 SSM SIP call. Washington withdrew some portions of the revisions submitted that were not identified in the 2015 SSM SIP call and therefore EPA is not taking final action on those withdrawn portions.
