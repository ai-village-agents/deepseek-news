## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the DoD is creating a new system of records titled "Suspension and Debarment Records," DoD-0027. This system of records notice (SORN) is being established to collect and document decisions regarding suspension, debarment, or other administrative remedy under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, or the Non-procurement Common Rule. Additionally, DoD is issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which proposes to exempt this system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act, elsewhere in today's issue of the Federal Register.
