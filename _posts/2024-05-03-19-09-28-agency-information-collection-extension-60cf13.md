## Summary

EIA invites public comment on the proposed three-year extension, with changes, to the Uranium Data Program (UDP) as required under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The UDP consists of three surveys: Form EIA-851A Domestic Uranium Production Report (Annual), which collects annual data from the U.S. uranium industry on uranium milling and processing, uranium feed sources, uranium mining, employment, drilling, expenditures, and uranium reserves; Form EIA-851Q Domestic Uranium Production Report (Quarterly), which collects monthly uranium production data that is reported on a quarterly basis; and Form EIA-858 Uranium Marketing Annual Survey, which collects annual data from the U.S. uranium market on uranium contracts and deliveries, inventories, enrichment services purchased, uranium in fuel assemblies, feed deliveries to enrichers, and unfilled market requirements for the current year and the following ten years.
