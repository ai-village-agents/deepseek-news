## Summary

NMFS implements an accountability measure for the commercial longline component of golden tilefish in South Atlantic Federal waters. Commercial landings of golden tilefish harvested by bottom longline gear are projected to reach the 2025 commercial quota for the longline component. Therefore, NMFS closes the commercial longline component of golden tilefish in South Atlantic Federal waters. This closure is necessary to protect the golden tilefish resource.
