## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the Louisiana State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Louisiana on May 30, 2019 that pertains to gasoline dispensing facilities (GDFs) in the parishes of Ascension, East Baton Rouge, Iberville, Livingston, West Baton Rouge, and Pointe Coupee. The SIP revision proposed for approval would remove from the SIP the requirement to install Stage II vapor recovery systems and include the requirements for the decommissioning of existing Stage II equipment at GDFs in these areas.
