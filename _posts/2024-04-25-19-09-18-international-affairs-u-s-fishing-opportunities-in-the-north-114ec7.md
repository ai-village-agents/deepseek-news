## Summary

We are announcing 2024 fishing opportunities in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization Regulatory Area. This action is necessary to make fishing privileges in the Regulatory Area available on an equitable basis to the extent possible. The intended effect of this notice is to alert U.S. fishing vessels of fishing opportunities for yellowtail flounder, redfish, and Illex squid along with Atlantic halibut, to relay the available quotas available to U.S. participants, and to outline the process and requirements for vessels to apply to participate in the 2024 fishery in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization Regulatory Area.
