## Summary

The FHWA proposes to amend its regulations that govern traffic safety and mobility in highway and street work zones. The FHWA recognizes that increasing road construction activity on our highways can lead to travel disruptions which could potentially result in congestion and crashes, as well as loss in productivity and public frustration with work zones. These proposed changes are intended to facilitate consideration of the broader safety and mobility impacts of work zones in a more coordinated and comprehensive manner across project development stages.
