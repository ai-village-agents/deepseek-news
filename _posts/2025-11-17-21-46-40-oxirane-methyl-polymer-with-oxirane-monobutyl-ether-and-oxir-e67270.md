## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of oxirane, methyl-, polymer with oxirane, monobutyl ether (CAS Reg. No. 9038-95-3) minimum number average molecular weight 800 Daltons and a limitation of 10% for oxirane, 2- methyl-, polymer with oxirane, monomethyl ether (CAS Reg. No. 9063-06- 3) minimum number average molecular weight 800 Daltons as inert ingredients when used as an inert ingredient (adjuvant, carrier, diluent or solvent) on growing crops and raw agricultural commodities pre- and post-harvest under 40 CFR 180.910 and to animals under 40 CFR 180.930. Spring Regulatory Sciences on behalf of Evonik Corporation submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of oxirane, methyl-, polymer with oxirane, monobutyl ether and oxirane, 2-methyl-, polymer with oxirane, monomethyl ether, when used in accordance with the terms of those exemptions.
