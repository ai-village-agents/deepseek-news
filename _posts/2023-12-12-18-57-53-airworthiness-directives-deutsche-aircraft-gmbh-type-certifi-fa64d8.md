## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Deutsche Aircraft GmbH Model 328-100 and 328-300 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a manufacturer's design review, which identified a potential risk of the rudder control rod buckling during operation with one engine inoperative during take-off and landing phases. This AD requires visually inspecting the rudder control rod, performing a one- time functional check of the rudder control rod, performing corrective actions if necessary, and reporting the inspection results, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also limits the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
