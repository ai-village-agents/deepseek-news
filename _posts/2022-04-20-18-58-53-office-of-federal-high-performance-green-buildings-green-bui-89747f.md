## Summary

The Green Building Advisory Committee provides advice to GSA as a statutorily required federal advisory committee, as specified in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) and in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). This notice invites qualified candidates with a combination of both lived and professional expertise in environmental justice, equity, and green buildings to apply for an appointment to serve as a member on GSA's Green Building Advisory Committee. This is a competitive process for one opening, in light of the statutory limitation on the size of the Committee.
