## Summary

The FAA is withdrawing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) that would have applied to certain Bell Helicopter Textron Canada Model 206A, 206B, and 206B3 helicopters. The NPRM was prompted by the need for corresponding operating limitations prohibiting flight, including hover, with the litter doorpost removed when certain litter kits are installed. The NPRM would have required revising the Operating Limitations, Section 1, of the existing Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) for your helicopter to add an operating limitation when a litter kit is installed to prohibit flight with the doorpost removed to prevent loss of structural integrity of the fuselage. Since issuance of the NPRM, the FAA has determined that an unsafe condition no longer exists. Accordingly, the NPRM is withdrawn.
