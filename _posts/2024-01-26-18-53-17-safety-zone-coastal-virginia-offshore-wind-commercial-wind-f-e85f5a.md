## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to establish 179 temporary 500-meter safety zones around the construction of 176 wind turbine generators and three offshore substations in Federal waters on the Outer Continental Shelf, east-northeast of Virginia Beach, Virginia. This action would protect life, property, and the environment during construction of their foundations and their subsequent installation, from May 1, 2024, to May 1, 2027. When subject to enforcement, only attending vessels and those vessels specifically authorized by the Fifth Coast Guard District Commander, or a designated representative, are permitted to enter or remain in the temporary safety zones.
