## Summary

In this rule, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by adding 36 entities under 41 entries to the Entity List. These 36 entities have been determined by the U.S. Government to be acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. These entities will be listed on the Entity List under the destinations of the People's Republic of China (China), Lithuania, Pakistan, the Russian Federation (Russia), Singapore, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the United Kingdom, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. Some entities are added under multiple entries, accounting for the difference in the total number of entities and entries in this rule. This rule also revises eleven existing entries under the destinations of Belarus, China, Russia, and Slovakia and corrects one existing entry on the Entity List under the destination of Pakistan. Lastly, this rule removes two entities and one address for a non-listed entity, consisting of one removal of an entity and one removal of an address under the destination of China, and one removal under the destination of Pakistan. The removals from the Entity List are made in connection with requests for removal that BIS received pursuant to the EAR and a review of the information provided in those requests.
