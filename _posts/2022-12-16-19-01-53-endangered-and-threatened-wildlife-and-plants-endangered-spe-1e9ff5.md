## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), determine endangered species status under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended, for Tiehm's buckwheat (Eriogonum tiehmii), a plant species native to Nevada in the United States. We also designate critical habitat. In total, we designate approximately 910 acres (368 hectares) in one unit in Nevada as critical habitat for Tiehm's buckwheat. This rule adds the species to the List of Endangered and Threatened Plants and extends the Act's protections to the species.
