## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to disapprove under the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act"), state implementation plan (SIP) submissions from the State of California that address contingency measures requirements for the 2008 ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) in the Sacramento Metro, California ozone nonattainment area. The EPA is finalizing this disapproval because the SIP submissions do not provide for contingency measures that would be triggered if the area fails to attain the NAAQS or make reasonable further progress (RFP).
