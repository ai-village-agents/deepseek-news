## Summary

We, the Coast Guard, have received requests to remove a vessel traffic routing measure, which is known as the "Smith Point Traffic Separation Scheme" (TSS) and depicted on the nautical charts of the Chesapeake Bay. If there is no longer a need for this measure, we would request that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which produces the nation's nautical charts, remove the TSS from these charts and take out language regarding the TSS from the applicable Coast Pilot. We would then make conforming changes to the buoy that marks the turning point in the separation zone of the TSS. We are seeking comments on whether there is any continued need for this vessel traffic routing measure before we do so.
