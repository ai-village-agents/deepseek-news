## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), in accordance with the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended, are amending the List of Endangered and Threatened Plants by removing Johnson's seagrass (Halophila johnsonii). We are also amending the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife by updating the entries for the Arctic subspecies of the ringed seal (Pusa hispida hispida) and the Beringia distinct population segment (DPS) of the Pacific bearded seal subspecies (Erignathus barbatus nauticus) to reflect the final designation of critical habitat for this subspecies and DPS, respectively. These amendments are based on previously published determinations by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce, which has jurisdiction for these species.
