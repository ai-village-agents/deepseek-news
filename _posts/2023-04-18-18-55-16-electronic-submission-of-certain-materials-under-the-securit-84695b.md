## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission" or "SEC") is proposing to require electronic filing or submission of certain forms and other filings or submissions that are required to be filed with or submitted to the Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and the rules and regulations under the Exchange Act. The proposal would require the electronic filing or submission on the Commission's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval ("EDGAR") system, using structured data where appropriate, for certain forms filed or submitted by self-regulatory organizations ("SROs"). The proposal would require the information currently contained in Form 19b-4(e) to be publicly posted on the SRO's website and remove the manual signature requirements for SRO proposed rule change filings. The Commission is also proposing that a clearing agency post supplemental material to its website. In addition, the proposal would amend rules under the Exchange Act and the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") to require the electronic filing or submission on EDGAR, using structured data where appropriate, of certain forms, reports and notices provided by broker-dealers, security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants. The proposed amendments also would require withdrawal in certain circumstances of notices filed in connection with an exception to counting certain dealing transactions toward determining whether a person is a security- based swap dealer. Finally, the Commission is proposing to allow electronic signatures in certain broker-dealer filings, and is proposing amendments regarding the Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single Report ("FOCUS Report") to harmonize with other rules, make technical corrections, and provide clarifications.
