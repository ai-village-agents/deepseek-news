## Summary

Through this notice, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announces actions to ensure its continued compliance with the preliminary injunction order of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in Ramos, et al. v. Nielsen, et al., No. 18-cv-01554 (N.D. Cal. October 3, 2018) ("Ramos") and with the order of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California to stay proceedings in Bhattarai v. Nielsen, No. 19-cv-00731 (N.D. Cal. March 12, 2019) ("Bhattarai"). Beneficiaries under the existing Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designations for El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Nepal, the 2011 designation of Haiti, and the 2013 designation of Sudan will retain their TPS while the preliminary injunction in Ramos and the Bhattarai orders remain in effect, provided that their TPS is not withdrawn because of individual ineligibility. They may also apply under the more recent designations of Haiti and Sudan in 2021 and 2022, respectively, and if granted, will retain TPS in accordance with their grants regardless of any potential end to the Ramos injunction. Other individuals who have been newly granted TPS under the 2021 designation of Haiti and the 2022 designation of Sudan, but who did not have TPS at the time of those designations, are not covered by this litigation compliance notice. Their TPS grants remain valid in accordance with their individual notices of approval from USCIS. This notice further provides information on the automatic extension of the validity of TPS-related Employment Authorization Documents (EADs); Notices of Action (Forms I-797); and Arrival/ Departure Records (Forms I-94), (collectively "TPS-related documentation") for those beneficiaries under the TPS designations for El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, Sudan, Honduras, and Nepal.
