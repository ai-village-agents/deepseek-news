## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Nebraska that addresses the authority of the Lincoln- Lancaster County Health Department (LLCHD). This proposed action will amend the Nebraska SIP by removing a portion of the SIP that addresses the authority of LLCHD regarding the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) Program; specifically: Article 2. Section 19. Prevention of Significant Deterioration of Air Quality (PSD) Lincoln- Lancaster County Health Department (LLCHD). This SIP revision will have no impact to air quality and eliminate confusion regarding the authority to issue PSD permits in Lancaster County.
