## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for the Allegheny River at Mile Marker 0.25-0.8. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters during a drone show display. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Pittsburgh or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
