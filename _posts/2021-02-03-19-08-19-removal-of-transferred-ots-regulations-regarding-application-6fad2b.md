## Summary

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is adopting a final rule (final rule) to rescind and remove certain regulations transferred to the FDIC from the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) in 2011 pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). These regulations generally concern the supervision and governance of State savings associations, including the application processing procedures for certain applications, notices and filings by State savings associations. In addition to the removal of our regulations, the FDIC is making technical changes to our regulations that do not currently apply to State savings associations. Following the rescission, the filing regulations pertaining to State savings associations and all other FDIC-supervised institutions will be substantially the same.
