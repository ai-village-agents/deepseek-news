## Summary

The FDIC, as part of its obligations under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, invites the general public and other Federal agencies to take this opportunity to comment on the request to approve a new information collections for its seventh biennial survey of households, which has been renamed the Survey of Household Use of Banking and Financial Services ("Household Survey"). This survey was previously named the FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households and was assigned OMB Control No. 3064-0167. FDIC is seeking a new OMB Control Number for this version of the survey. The Household Survey is scheduled to be conducted in partnership with the U.S. Census Bureau as a supplement to its June 2021 Current Population Survey (CPS). The survey collects information on U.S. households' use of bank accounts and other transaction accounts including prepaid cards, online payment services, nonbank financial transaction services, and bank and nonbank credit. The results of these ongoing surveys will be published in the FDIC's How America Banks reports which help inform policymakers, bankers, and researchers about how households use, or don't use, the banking system. On December 2, 2020, the FDIC requested comment for 60 days on the proposed information collection. No comments were received. The FDIC hereby gives notice of its plan to submit to OMB a request to approve this information collection, and again invites comment on the information collection.
