## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Defense (DoD) is establishing a new Department-wide system of records titled, "DoD Historical Records," DoD-0014. This system of records covers DoD's maintenance of records about individuals in the Department of Defense (DoD) historical system, the purpose of which is to collect, preserve, and present the history of the components within the DoD to support agency leadership and to inform the American public. Additionally, DoD is issuing a Direct Final Rule, which exempts this system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act, elsewhere in today's issue of the Federal Register.
