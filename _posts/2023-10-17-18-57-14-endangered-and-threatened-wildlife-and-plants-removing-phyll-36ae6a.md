## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), withdraw the proposal to remove Phyllostegia glabra var. lanaiensis from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Plants (List). This withdrawal is based on new surveys conducted over the past 3 years since completing the 5-year review for the species; these surveys have identified new suitable habitats comprised of native vegetation within the former range of P. glabra var. lanaiensis. Therefore, we determined that additional information is needed before concluding that the species is extinct. With this withdrawal of the proposal, P. glabra var. lanaiensis will remain on the List as endangered. Elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, we publish a final rule removing 21 species that were part of our September 30, 2021, proposed rule.
