## Summary

The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) published a final rule in the Federal Register on January 15, 2026, amending its regulation to permit participants in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) to convert amounts in their traditional TSP balances to their Roth TSP balances (91 FR 1669). This document corrects a minor, non-substantive issue in the published version, where one instance of the term "Roth initiation date" appeared rather than the term "Roth begin date."
