## Summary

NMFS implements an accountability measure (AM) for commercial Spanish mackerel in the northern zone of the Atlantic exclusive economic zone (EEZ). NMFS projects that the commercial quota for Spanish mackerel in the northern zone of the Atlantic EEZ will be reached by June 21, 2022. Therefore, NMFS closes the northern zone in the Atlantic EEZ to commercial harvest of Spanish mackerel on June 21, 2022. This closure is necessary to protect the Spanish mackerel resource in the Atlantic.
