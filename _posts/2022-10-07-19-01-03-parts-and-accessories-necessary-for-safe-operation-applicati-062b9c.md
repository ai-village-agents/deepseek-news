## Summary

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) announces its decision to deny Intellistop, Inc.'s (Intellistop) application for an exemption to allow motor carriers to operate commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) equipped with Intellistop's module which, when brakes are applied, pulses the required rear clearance, identification, and brake lamps from a lower-level lighting intensity to a higher-level lighting intensity 4 times in 2 seconds and then returns the lights to a steady-burning state. Intellistop has not shown that an industry-wide exemption would likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to or greater than the level of safety provided by the regulation.
