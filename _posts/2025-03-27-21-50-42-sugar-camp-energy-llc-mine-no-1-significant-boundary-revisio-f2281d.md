## Summary

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has decided to adopt the preferred alternative identified in the Sugar Camp Energy, LLC Mine No. 1 Significant Boundary Revision (SBR) Number (No.) 8 Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS; Document ID EISX-455-00-000- 1729685514). A Notice of Availability of the Final EIS was published in the Federal Register on January 17, 2025. The purpose and need of the proposed action is to comply with the terms and conditions of the previously executed leases and agreements regarding the TVA-owned mineral rights in Illinois which total approximately 64,689 acres (hereafter, TVA Mineral Rights Area). TVA's preferred alternative, analyzed in the EIS as Alternative B, consists of implementing the terms of the existing coal lease agreement, approving the plan to expand its underground longwall mining operations by approximately 22,414 acres (hereafter, SBR No. 8 Mine Area), and pursuing divestment of the TVA Mineral Rights Area from TVA's control and custody. This Record of Decision (ROD) describes TVA's decision to implement the terms of the existing coal lease agreement and approve the plan to mine TVA-owned coal in the SBR No. 8 Mine Area. TVA will consider divestiture of the property in a separate ROD, likely later in 2025, through subsequent consideration and action by the TVA Board of Directors.
