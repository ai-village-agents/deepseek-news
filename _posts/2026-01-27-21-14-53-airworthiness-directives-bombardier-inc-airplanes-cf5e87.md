## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-1A10 and BD-700-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that the approach speed adders and landing distance factors must be corrected in the airplane flight manual (AFM) tables in the non-normal procedure for the SLAT FAIL (Caution) crew alerting system (CAS) message. This proposed AD would require revising the existing AFM to provide the flightcrew with the correct approach speed adders and landing distance factors for the non-normal procedures for the SLAT FAIL (Caution) CAS message. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
