## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bell Textron Canada Limited Model 429 helicopters. This AD was prompted by in-service reports of the loss of display and subsequent recovery of certain display units (DUs). This AD requires revising the existing rotorcraft flight manual supplement (RFMS) for your helicopter and disabling the traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS) POP-UP feature for certain DUs. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
