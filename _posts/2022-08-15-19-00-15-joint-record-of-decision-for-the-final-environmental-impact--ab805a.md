## Summary

BOEM announces the availability of two supplements to the joint ROD on the final environmental impact statement (FEIS) for the construction and operations plan (COP) submitted by Vineyard Wind 1 LLC (Vineyard Wind 1). The joint ROD included the decisions of the Department of the Interior (DOI), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) regarding the Vineyard Wind 1 Offshore Wind Energy Project. In the joint ROD, the USACE adopted the FEIS to support its permitting actions under the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (RHA) and Clean Water Act (CWA). The ROD supplements pertain only to the USACE sections of the joint ROD. They correct clerical errors and clarify a statement. The ROD supplements are available on BOEM's website at https://www.boem.gov/Vineyard-Wind.
