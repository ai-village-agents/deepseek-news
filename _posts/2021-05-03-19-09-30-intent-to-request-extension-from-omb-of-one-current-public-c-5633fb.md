## Summary

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) invites public comment on one currently approved Information Collection Request (ICR), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number 1652-0028, abstracted below, that we will submit to OMB for extension in compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected burden. The collection involves requesting information from flight and cabin crew members of air carriers to verify employment status to confirm eligibility to participate in voluntary advanced self-defense training provided by TSA. Each crew member will also be required to complete an electronic Injury Waiver Form. Additionally, each participant is asked to complete an anonymous course evaluation at the conclusion of the training.
