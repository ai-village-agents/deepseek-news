## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Community-Based Organizations' Changes in Preparedness and Resources for Support of Biomedical HIV Prevention. The information collection project will be used to assess community-based organizations' (CBOs) awareness of, intentions to provide, and provision of Treatment as Prevention (TasP), non- occupational post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP), or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among clinical and non-clinical CBOs that have received funding from CDC's Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention (DHAP) and those that applied but did not receive funding.
