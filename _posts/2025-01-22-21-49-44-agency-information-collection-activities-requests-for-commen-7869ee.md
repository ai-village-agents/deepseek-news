The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on October 21, 2024. The collection involves the submission of FAA Form 8710-3 for the certification process of agricultural aircraft operators, and other reporting and recordkeeping activities required of agricultural aircraft operators. The information to be collected is necessary to evaluate the applicants' qualifications for certification. This collection also involves the submission of information in petitions for exemption by agricultural aircraft operators, plans for operations over congested areas, and recordkeeping requirements for agricultural aircraft operators.
