## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2011-18-52 for certain Agusta S.p.A. (now Leonardo S.p.a.) Model AB139 and AW139 helicopters. AD 2011-18-52 requires revising the life limit for certain part-numbered tail rotor (T/R) blades, updating the helicopter's historical records, repetitively inspecting each T/R blade for a crack or damage, and depending on the results, replacing the T/R blade. Since the FAA issued AD 2011-18-52, the manufacturer developed improved T/R blades using different materials and established life limits for each improved blade. This proposed AD would retain certain requirements from AD 2011- 18-52, revise certain requirements from AD 2011-18-52, and expand the applicability to include the newly-designed T/R blades. The actions of this proposed AD are intended to address an unsafe condition on these products.
