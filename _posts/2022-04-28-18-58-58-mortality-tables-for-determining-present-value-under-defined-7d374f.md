## Summary

This document sets forth proposed regulations prescribing mortality tables to be used for most defined benefit pension plans. The tables specify the probability of survival year-by-year for an individual based on age, gender, and other factors. The tables are used (together with other actuarial assumptions) to calculate the present value of a stream of expected future benefit payments for purposes of determining the minimum funding requirements for the plan. These mortality tables are also relevant for determining the minimum required amount of a lump-sum distribution from such a plan. These regulations affect participants in, beneficiaries of, employers maintaining, and administrators of certain defined benefit pension plans.
