## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Fokker Services B.V. Model F28 Mark 0100 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of a crack found in the inboard boom of the left- hand frame at fuselage station (STA) 17011. This AD requires a detailed inspection of the fuselage at STA 17011 for any cracking, repair if necessary, and a reporting requirement, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
