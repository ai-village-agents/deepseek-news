## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to redesignate the Oakridge, Oregon nonattainment area (Oakridge NAA or Oakridge area) to attainment for the 1987 National Ambient Air Quality Standard for particulate matter of 10 microns or less (PM<INF>10</INF> NAAQS). EPA also proposes to approve the Oakridge PM<INF>10</INF> maintenance plan for the area demonstrating continued compliance with the PM<INF>10</INF> NAAQS through with the Lane Regional Clean Air Agency (LRAPA), submitted to EPA on January 13, 2022, along with the redesignation request for inclusion into the Oregon State Implementation Plan (SIP). EPA also proposes to approve revisions to LRAPA's rules to reflect the redesignation. Additionally, EPA proposes to approve the PM<INF>10</INF> motor vehicle emissions budgets included in the maintenance plan and inform the public that we are starting the adequacy process for the proposed motor vehicle emissions budgets, including a public comment period. Finally, EPA proposes to take final agency action on the wildfire exceptional event request submitted by ODEQ on July 22, 2021 and concurred on by EPA on April 1, 2022. EPA proposes these actions pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act).
