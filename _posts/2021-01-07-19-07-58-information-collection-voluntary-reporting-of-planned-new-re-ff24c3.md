## Summary

On December 29, 2020, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) inadvertently issued an information collection titled, "Voluntary Reporting of Planned New Reactor Applications" in the Federal Register. The information collection is being withdrawn because it duplicates a document previously published in the Federal Register on December 1, 2020.
