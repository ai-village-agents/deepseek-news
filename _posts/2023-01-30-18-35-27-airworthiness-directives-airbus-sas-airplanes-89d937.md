## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A319-151N, -153N and -171N airplanes; Model A320-251N, -252N, -253N, -271N, -272N, and -273N airplanes; and Model A321-251N, -252N, -253N, -271N, -272N, -251NX, -252NX, -253NX, - 271NX, and -272NX airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a safety review of the airplane fuel system, which identified that the electrical harness routing of the engine low pressure shut off valve (LPSOV) is not adequately protected against uncontained engine rotor failure (UERF). This proposed AD would require modification of the LPSOV electrical harness routing on either the left-hand engine or the right-hand engine, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
