## Summary

FRA is updating the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold (NSRT) for purposes of FRA's regulation on the Use of Locomotive Horns at Public Highway-Rail Grade Crossings. This action is needed to ensure the public has the proper permissible risk threshold to evaluate risk resulting from prohibiting routine locomotive horn sounding at highway- rail grade crossings located in quiet zones. This is the ninth update to the NSRT and it is increasing from 13,811 to 15,488.
