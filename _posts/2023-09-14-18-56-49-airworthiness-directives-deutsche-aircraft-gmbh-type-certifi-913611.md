# Airworthiness Directives; Deutsche Aircraft GmbH (Type Certificate Previously Held by 328 Support Services GmbH; AvCraft Aerospace GmbH; Fairchild Dornier GmbH; Dornier Luftfahrt GmbH) Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Deutsche Aircraft GmbH Model 328-100 and 328-300 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a manufacturer's design review, which identified a potential risk of the rudder control rod buckling during operation with one engine inoperative during take-off and landing phases. This proposed AD would require visually inspecting the rudder control rod, performing a one-time functional check of the rudder control rod, performing corrective actions if necessary, and reporting the inspection results, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). This proposed AD would also limit the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
