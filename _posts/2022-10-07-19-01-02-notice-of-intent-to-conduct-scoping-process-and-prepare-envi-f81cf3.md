The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has received Environmental Report, Supplement 2, from Florida Power & Light Company (FPL, the applicant), dated June 9, 2022, related to FPL's application for subsequent license renewal (SLR) of Renewed Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-31 and DPR-41 for Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Unit Nos. 3 and 4 (Turkey Point). The NRC staff has determined that the Environmental Report, Supplement 2, is acceptable for docketing, and that the staff will prepare a supplement to its final supplemental environmental impact statement (FSEIS) for Turkey Point subsequent license renewal, i.e., NUREG-1437, Supplement 5, Second Renewal, "Generic Environmental Impact Statement for License Renewal of Nuclear Plants, Supplement 5, Second Renewal, Regarding Subsequent License Renewal for Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Unit Nos. 3 and 4, Final Report" (October 2019). The subsequent renewed operating licenses would authorize the applicant to operate Turkey Point for an additional 20 years beyond the period specified in each of the current licenses. The current operating licenses for Turkey Point Unit Nos. 3 and 4 expire on July 19, 2032, and April 10, 2033, respectively. The NRC will conduct a limited scoping process to gather information necessary to prepare a supplement to its environmental impact statement (EIS) to evaluate the environmental impacts of SLR of the operating licenses for Turkey Point. The NRC is seeking public comment on the proper scope of the EIS supplement to be prepared for this action.
