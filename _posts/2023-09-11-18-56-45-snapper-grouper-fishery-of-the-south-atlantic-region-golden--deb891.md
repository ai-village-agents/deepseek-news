## Summary

The South Atlantic Fishery Management Council has submitted amendments to three fishery management plans (FMPs) for review, approval, and implementation by NMFS. If approved by the Secretary of Commerce, the amendments would revise the FMPs for the Snapper-Grouper Fishery and the Golden Crab Fishery of the South Atlantic Region, and the Dolphin and Wahoo Fishery of the Atlantic, referenced here as the Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC) Control Rule Amendments. The ABC Control Rule Amendments would modify the ABC control rules, allow phase-in of ABC changes, allow for some carry-over of an unharvested portion of the annual catch limit (ACL) to the following fishing year, and modify the FMP framework procedures to implement carry-overs of ACLs when appropriate. The purpose of the ABC Control Rule Amendments is to ensure catch level recommendations are based on the best scientific information available, prevent overfishing while achieving optimum yield, and increase flexibility in setting catch limits.
