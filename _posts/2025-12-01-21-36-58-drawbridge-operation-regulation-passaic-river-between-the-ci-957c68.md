## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to modify the operating regulation that governs the Point No Point Railroad Bridge across the Passaic River, mile 2.6, between the City of Newark and Town of Kearny, NJ. The proposed change in the regulation will allow the bridge to be remotely operated from the Conrail North Jersey Dispatch Center in Mount Laurel, NJ. This proposed change will alter the operating schedule of the bridge to open on signal and no longer require a four-hour advance notice. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
