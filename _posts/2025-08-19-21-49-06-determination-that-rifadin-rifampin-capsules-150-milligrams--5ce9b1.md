## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) has determined that RIFADIN (rifampin) capsules, 150 milligrams (mg) and 300 mg, were not withdrawn from sale for reasons of safety or effectiveness to the extent that the drugs can be manufactured or formulated in a manner that satisfies any applicable acceptable intake limit for nitrosamine impurities. This determination means that FDA will not begin procedures to withdraw approval of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) that refer to these drug products, and it will allow FDA to continue to approve ANDAs that refer to the products as long as they meet relevant legal and regulatory requirements, including satisfying any applicable acceptable intake limit for nitrosamine impurities.
