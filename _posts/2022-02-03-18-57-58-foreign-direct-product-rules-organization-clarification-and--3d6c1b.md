## Summary

The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is clarifying, reorganizing, and making minor corrections to the provisions of the foreign-direct product (FDP) rules. Before this final rule, the FDP rules appeared in parts 736 and 744 of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR); now, the rules are consolidated in part 734 of the EAR. These revisions clarify the applicability of the FDP rules and make one correction applicable to the FDP rules as to the term "U.S.- origin technology and software."
