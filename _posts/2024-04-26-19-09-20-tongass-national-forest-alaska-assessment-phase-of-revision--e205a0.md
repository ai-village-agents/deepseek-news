## Summary

The Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, is initiating the assessment phase of the Land Management Plan revision process for the Tongass National Forest, located in Southeast Alaska. The assessment supports the subsequent planning phase, which will result in a revised land management plan to guide resource management activities on the Tongass National Forest. The assessment will identify and consider relevant and readily accessible material about ecological, social, and economic conditions and trends in the planning area, and will identify best available scientific information including Native or Indigenous knowledge. Trends and conditions identified in the assessment will inform the need to change the existing plan as well as the subsequent revision process.
