## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice invites the general public and other public agencies to comment on this proposed information collection. This is an existing collection in use without an OMB Control Number in which we are seeking approval to establish a process for requesting a waiver from the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) to offer SNAP recipients incentives at SNAP authorized retailer locations that encourage them to purchase healthier foods. This collection burden only affects SNAP retailers as well as private organizations or governmental entities who partner with SNAP retailers. There are no data collection activities for SNAP households in this request.
