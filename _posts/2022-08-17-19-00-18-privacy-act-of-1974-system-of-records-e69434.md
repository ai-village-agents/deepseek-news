## Summary

The Enterprise Income Verification System (EIV) is used to verify program participants/tenants, reported income, identify unreported income sources and/or amounts and identify substantial annual income discrepancies amongst households that receive HUD provided rental assistance through programs administered by HUD's Office of Public and Indian Housing and Office of Housing Multifamily program. Under the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Office of Public and Indian Housing proposes to update the system of records titled EIV. The EIV System has been modified replacing the Income Discrepancy Report with the Income Validation Tool built on the MicroStrategy platform.
