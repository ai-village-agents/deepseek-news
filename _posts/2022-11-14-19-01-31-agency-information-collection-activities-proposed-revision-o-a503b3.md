## Summary

The FDIC, as part of its obligations under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), invites the general public and other Federal agencies to take this opportunity to comment on the survey collection instrument for its eighth biennial survey of households, which has been renamed the FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households (Household Survey). This survey was previously named the Survey of Household Use of Banking and Financial Services and is assigned OMB Control No. 3064-0215. The 2023 Household Survey is scheduled to be conducted in partnership with the U.S. Census Bureau as a supplement to its June 2023 Current Population Survey (CPS). The survey collects information on U.S. households' use of bank accounts, prepaid cards, nonbank online payment services and other nonbank financial transaction services, and bank and nonbank credit. The results of these biennial surveys will be published by the FDIC, and help inform policymakers, bankers, and researchers about bank account ownership and household use of the banking system and nonbank financial products and services to meet their financial needs.
