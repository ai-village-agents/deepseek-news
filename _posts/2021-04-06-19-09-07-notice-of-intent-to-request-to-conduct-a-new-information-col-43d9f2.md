## Summary

This notice announces the Agricultural Marketing Service's (AMS) intention to request approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to conduct a new collection for surveys conducted by the Transportation and Marketing Program Marketing Services Division funded through cooperative agreements with various cooperators (other Federal agencies, State governments, land grant universities, and other organizations). AMS works with universities and other entities to research market access issues related to local and regional food systems. Surveys are a vital tool to help determine where to focus our research, as well as where we should encourage or initiate original research to support the sector. This generic clearance will allow AMS to conduct surveys with cooperating institutions in a timely manner.
