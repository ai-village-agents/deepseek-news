## Summary

This notice contains the preliminary results of the U.S. Department of Commerce's (Commerce) administrative review of the antidumping duty order on certain crystalline silicon photovoltaic products (solar products) from the People's Republic of China (China) covering the period of review (POR) February 1, 2021, through January 31, 2022. Commerce preliminarily finds that the sole mandatory respondent under review sold subject merchandise at prices below normal value (NV) during the POR, that two companies under review had no entries, exports, or sales of solar products during the POR, and that it is appropriate to rescind this review with respect to 54 companies/ company groupings because all requests to review these companies/ company groupings were timely withdrawn. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results of review.
