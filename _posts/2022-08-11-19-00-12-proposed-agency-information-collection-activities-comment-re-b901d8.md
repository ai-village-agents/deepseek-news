## Summary

In accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), the OCC, the Board, and the FDIC (the agencies) may not conduct or sponsor, and the respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. On January 20, 2022, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), of which the agencies are members, requested public comment for 60 days on a proposal to extend for three years, with revision, the Country Exposure Report (FFIEC 009) and the Country Exposure Information Report (FFIEC 009a), which are currently approved collections of information. As described in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section, after considering the comments received on the proposal, the agencies are proceeding with the proposed revisions to the FFIEC 009 and FFIEC 009a, but with certain modifications. In addition, the agencies will make clarifying revisions to the report form and instructions in response to comments received on the proposal. The agencies are giving notice that they are sending the collections to OMB for review. If approved by OMB, these revisions would take effect for the December 31, 2022, report date.
