## Summary

The University of Alaska (UA) has filed an application for a recordable disclaimer of interest (RDI) application with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for the lands described in Mineral Survey No. 2407. The lands are also known as Silver Fox Mine. The lands were patented to UA on December 27, 1984, with a reversionary interest to the United States. UA seeks to remove the reversionary interest and a perceived cloud on title.
