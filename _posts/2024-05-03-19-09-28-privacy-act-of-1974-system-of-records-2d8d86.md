## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (Privacy Act), the Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service (IRS), proposes to establish a new system of records entitled, "Treasury/IRS 34.018, Insider Risk Management Records," within its inventory of records systems subject to the Privacy Act. The IRS will use this system to identify potential threats to IRS resources and information assets and facilitate management of insider threat investigations, complaints, inquiries, and counterintelligence threat detection activities. An "insider" is defined to include current and former employees, contractors, interns, visitors, and any other individuals who have or who had persistent authorized access to IRS assets including any IRS facility, information, equipment, network, or system. An "insider threat" is the threat that an insider will use his or her authorized access, wittingly or unwittingly, to do harm to the IRS mission, resources, personnel, facilities, information, equipment, networks, or systems.
