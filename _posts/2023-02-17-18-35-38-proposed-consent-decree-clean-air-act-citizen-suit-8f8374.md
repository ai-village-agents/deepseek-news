## Summary

In accordance with the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA or the Act), notice is given of a proposed consent decree in Environmental Integrity Project and Sierra Club v. Regan, No. 1:22-cv-3063 (D.D.C.). On October 10, 2022, Plaintiffs Environmental Integrity Project and Sierra Club filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Plaintiffs alleged that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) failed to perform certain non- discretionary duties in accordance with the Act to take final action with respect to a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). The proposed consent decree would establish a deadline for EPA to sign a notice of final rulemaking.
