## Summary

In the Federal Register of June 20, 2023, EPA proposed significant new use rules (SNURs) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for 18 chemical substances that were the subject of premanufacture notices (PMNs) and a subsequent TSCA Order. EPA is withdrawing the proposed rules because the Agency withdrew the TSCA Order that was the basis of the rules on December 18, 2024.
