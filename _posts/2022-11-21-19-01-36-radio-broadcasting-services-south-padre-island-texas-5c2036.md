## Summary

This document requests comments on a Petition for Rule Making filed by Eduardo Gallegos, proposing to amend the FM Table of Allotments, by substituting Channel 288A for vacant Channel 237A at South Padre Island, Texas to accommodate the hybrid modification application of Station KRIX(FM) that proposes the substitution of Channel 237A for Channel 288A at Port Isabel, Texas and modification of Station KRIX(FM)'s license to specify operation on Channel 237A at Port Isabel, Texas. A staff engineering analysis indicates that Channel 288A can be allotted to South Padre Island, Texas, consistent with the minimum distance separation requirements of the Commission's rules (Rules), with a site restriction of 11 km (7 miles) south of the community. The reference coordinates are 26-01-30 NL and 97-09-15 WL.
