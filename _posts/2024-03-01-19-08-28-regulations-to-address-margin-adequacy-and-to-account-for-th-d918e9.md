## Summary

On April 14, 2023, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission or CFTC) published a notice of proposed rulemaking (First Proposal) that proposed to amend the derivatives clearing organization (DCO) risk management regulations adopted under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) to permit futures commission merchants (FCMs) that are clearing members of DCOs (clearing FCMs), subject to specified requirements, to treat separate accounts of a single customer as accounts of separate legal entities for purposes of certain Commission regulations. In light of comments received supporting direct application of separate account treatment requirements to FCMs in the Commission's regulations, the Commission has determined to withdraw the First Proposal. The Commission now proposes regulations to require an FCM to ensure that a customer does not withdraw funds from its account with the FCM if the balance in such account after such withdrawal would be insufficient to meet the customer's initial margin requirements, and relatedly, to permit an FCM, in certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions, to treat the separate accounts of a single customer as accounts of separate entities for purposes of certain Commission regulations (Second Proposal). The proposed amendments would establish the conditions under which an FCM may engage in such separate account treatment.
