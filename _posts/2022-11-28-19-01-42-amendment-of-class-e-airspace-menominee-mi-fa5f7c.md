## Summary

This action amends the Class E airspace at Menominee, MI. This action is due to an airspace review conducted as part of the decommissioning of the Menominee very high frequency (VHF) omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimal Operational Network (MON) Program. The name and geographic coordinates of the airport are also being updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
