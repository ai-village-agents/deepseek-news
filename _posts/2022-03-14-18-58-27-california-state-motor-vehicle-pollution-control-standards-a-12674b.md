## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has completed the reconsideration of its 2019 action withdrawing a 2013 Clean Air Act (CAA) waiver of preemption for California's greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards and zero emission vehicle (ZEV) sale mandate, which are part of California's Advanced Clean Car (ACC) program. This decision rescinds EPA's 2019 waiver withdrawal, thus bringing back into force the 2013 ACC program waiver, including a waiver of preemption for California's ZEV sales mandate and GHG emissions standards. In addition, EPA is withdrawing the interpretive view of CAA section 177 included in its 2019 action, that States may not adopt California's GHG standards pursuant to section 177 even if EPA has granted California a waiver for such standards. Accordingly, other States may continue to adopt and enforce California's GHG standards under section 177 so long as they meet the requirements of that section.
