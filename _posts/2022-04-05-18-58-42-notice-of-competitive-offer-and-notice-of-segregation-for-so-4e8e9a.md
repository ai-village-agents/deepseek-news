## Summary

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Las Vegas Field Office is announcing that it will accept competitive bids to determine a preferred right-of-way applicant for solar energy development on a 1,635-acre parcel of public land, referred to as the Dry Lake East Designated Leasing Area, located in Clark County, Nevada. The BLM also announces the segregation of the 1,635-acre parcel of public lands from appropriation under the public land laws, including the Mining Law, but not the Mineral Leasing or Material Sales Acts, for a period of 2 years from the date of publication of this notice, subject to valid existing rights. This segregation will facilitate the orderly administration of the public lands while the BLM considers potential solar development on the described parcel.
