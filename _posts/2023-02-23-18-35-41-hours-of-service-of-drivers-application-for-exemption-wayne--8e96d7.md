## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to deny the application from Wayne Moore, Jr. for an exemption from four provisions of the Federal hours-of-service (HOS) regulations. FMCSA analyzed the application and public comments and determined that the exemption would not achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent such exemption.
