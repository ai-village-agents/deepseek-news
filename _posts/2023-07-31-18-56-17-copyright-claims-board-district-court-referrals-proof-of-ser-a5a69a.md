## Summary

Pursuant to the Copyright Alternative in Small-Claims Enforcement Act, the U.S. Copyright Office is adopting as final a December 19, 2022 interim rule allowing the Copyright Claims Board to modify or suspend certain rules when a claim is referred by a district court and, in cases that are first filed before the Copyright Claims Board, accept alternative proof of service forms. The interim rule also clarified the rules governing default proceedings and law student representation, and made certain technical corrections.
