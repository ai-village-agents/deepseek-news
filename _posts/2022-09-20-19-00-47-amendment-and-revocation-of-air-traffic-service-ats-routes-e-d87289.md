## Summary

This action corrects a final rule published by the FAA in the Federal Register on September 8, 2022, that amended jet routes J-14, J- 24, J-52, and J-68; and removed jet routes J-165, J-207, J-506, J-561, J-563, J-573, J-582, and J-585. The final rule inadvertently re- inserted a segment in J-52 that had been removed by a previous rulemaking action. This action makes an editorial correction to the description of J-52 to remove the incorrect route segment.
