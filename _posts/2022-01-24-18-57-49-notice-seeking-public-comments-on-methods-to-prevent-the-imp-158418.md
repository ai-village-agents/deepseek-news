## Summary

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, on behalf of the Forced Labor Enforcement Task Force (FLETF), is seeking comments from the public, as required by the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, on how best to ensure that goods, wares, articles, and merchandise mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part with forced labor in the People's Republic of China are not imported into the United States. Such goods, wares, articles and merchandise include those mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part with forced labor by Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Tibetans, and members of other persecuted groups in the People's Republic of China, and especially in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. After receiving comments, the FLETF will conduct a public hearing and develop a strategy for supporting enforcement of section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended.
