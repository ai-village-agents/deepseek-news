## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) received a public comment from EnergySolutions to the draft report entitled, NUREG-1307, Revision 19, "Report on Waste Burial Charges: Changes in Decommissioning Waste Disposal Costs at Low-Level Waste Burial Facilities." EnergySolutions' comment identified a cost escalation error that it had generated and used to develop unit disposal costs for the Clive, Utah, low-level waste disposal facility. EnergySolutions subsequently submitted this information in July 2022, for the preparation of draft NUREG-1307, Revision 19. The erroneous unit disposal cost information was published in the draft and final NUREG-1307, Revision 19. The EnergySolutions' comment provided revised disposal cost information that would impact the waste burial escalation factors presented in NUREG-1307, Revision 19.
