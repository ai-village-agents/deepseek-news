## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for all navigable waters of the Ohio River from mile marker (MM) 731.0 to MM 734.0. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters near Troy, IN, during a wire-crossing event. Entry into, transiting through, or anchoring within this zone is prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Sector Ohio Valley (COTP) or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
