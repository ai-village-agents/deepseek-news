## Summary

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) approves proposed Reliability Standard PRC-024-4 (Frequency and Voltage Protection Settings for Synchronous Generators, Type 1 and Type 2 Wind Resources, and Synchronous Condensers), Reliability Standard PRC-029-1 (Frequency and Voltage Ride-through Requirements for Inverter-Based Resources), and a definition of "Ride-through," which the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) submitted in response to a Commission directive. In addition, the Commission directs NERC to clarify documentation requirements for legacy equipment needed to support an exemption request pursuant to Reliability Standard PRC-029- 1; to consider whether, and if so how, to address a total of two exception- and exemption-related issues raised by commenters; and to submit an informational filing that assesses the reliability impact of the exemptions to Reliability Standard PRC-029-1.
