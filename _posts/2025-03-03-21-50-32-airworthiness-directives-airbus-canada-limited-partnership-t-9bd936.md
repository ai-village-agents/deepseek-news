## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500- 1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by events where the cargo bottle fail caution message was displayed. This proposed AD would require replacing affected low rate discharge (LRD) bottles, inspecting extinguishing discharge lines and tubes, and replacing extinguishing discharge lines and tubes, as applicable, and would also prohibit the installation of affected LRD bottles, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
