## Summary

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) intends to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) or environmental assessment (EA) for the purchase of electricity generated by the proposed Moore County Solar Project in Moore County, Tennessee. The EIS or EA will assess the potential environmental effects of constructing, operating, and maintaining the proposed 200-megawatt (MW) alternating current (AC) solar facility. The proposed 200 MW AC solar facility would occupy approximately 2,000 acres of the roughly 3,300-acre Project Study Area. Public comments are invited concerning both the scope of the environmental review and environmental issues that should be addressed in the EIS or EA. TVA is also requesting data, information, and analysis relevant to the proposed action from the public; affected federal, state, tribal, and local governments, agencies, and offices; the scientific community; industry; or any other interested party.
