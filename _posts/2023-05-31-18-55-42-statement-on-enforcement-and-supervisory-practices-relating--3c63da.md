## Summary

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is publishing a statutorily mandated small business lending rule concurrently with this Policy Guidance. The rule amends Regulation B to implement changes to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) made by section 1071 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA). This policy guidance informs covered financial institutions that the CFPB intends to focus its supervisory and enforcement activities in connection with the new rule in particular on ensuring that covered lenders do not discourage small business loan applicants from providing responsive data, including responses to lenders' ECOA-mandated demographic data requests.
