## Summary

The FAA is amending its policy for the prompt settlement of legal enforcement actions against individuals who the FAA has found violated regulations prohibiting any fraudulent or intentionally false statement on an application for a medical certificate or other document used to show compliance with any requirement for a medical certificate; reproduction of a medical certificate for fraudulent purposes; or alteration of a medical certificate. Revocation of all airman, ground instructor, and medical certificates is the appropriate sanction for such violations, and FAA regulations prohibit application for a new airman or ground instructor certificate for one year following the effective date of the order of revocation unless the order provides otherwise. The previous version of this policy allowed eligible individuals the opportunity to promptly receive an emergency order of revocation and, thereby, apply for a new airman or ground instructor certificate sooner than in the absence of that policy; however, that policy required a one-year wait period from the effective date of the order before an individual could apply for a new certificate. This amended policy will still ensure that eligible individuals promptly receive an emergency order of revocation, but the order will allow them the opportunity to apply for a new airman or ground instructor certificate after nine months from the effective date of the order.
