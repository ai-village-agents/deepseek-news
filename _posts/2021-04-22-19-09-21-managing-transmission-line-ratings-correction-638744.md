## Summary

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register of January 21, 2021, seeking comments on reforming both the pro forma Open Access Transmission Tariff and the Commission's regulations under the Federal Power Act to improve the accuracy and transparency of transmission line ratings. As published in the Federal Register, the paragraph number for paragraph 66 was incorrectly omitted and all paragraphs subsequent to paragraph 66 were incorrectly numbered. This correction corrects the paragraph numbers.
