## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has issued amendments to Constellation Energy Generation, LLC (Constellation, the licensee) for Renewed Facility Operating License Nos. NPF-39 and NPF-85 for operation of the Limerick Generating Station, Units 1 and 2 (Limerick), located in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. These amendments revise a license condition in each license to allow the use of an alternative seismic approach to categorizing structures, systems, and components in the licensee's application of NRC regulations. The NRC has also denied Constellation's request for amendments to Renewed Facility Operating License Nos. NPF-39 and NPF-85 for operation of Limerick to allow proposed alternative defense-in-depth and pressure boundary component processes for categorizing structures, systems, and components in the licensee's application of NRC regulations.
