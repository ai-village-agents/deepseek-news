## Summary

Department of Justice (DOJ), Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Statistics, will be submitting the following information collection request to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This proposed information collection was previously published, allowing for a 60 day comment period. Seven comments from the public were received during this period and are thoroughly addressed in the supporting statement for this collection. Three comments requested that information on interpreters be added. The requesters sought data elements reflecting for whom the interpreter was ordered (defendant, witness, victim), whether the interpreter was present for all hearings, and the qualifications of the interpreter. BJS added data elements asking courts to provide whether an interpreter was ordered for the case and for which party(ies) to the case the interpreter was ordered. BJS does not expect these changes to impact the estimated respondent burden.
