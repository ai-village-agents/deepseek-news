## Summary

The Coast Guard has issued a temporary deviation from the operating schedule that governs the Florida East Coast (FEC) Railroad Bridge across the New River, mile 2.5, at Fort Lauderdale, Florida. This deviation will test a change to the drawbridge operation schedule to determine if the proposed operating schedule changes will meet the reasonable needs of maritime traffic and railway traffic. This deviation will allow the drawbridge to operate a more predictable schedule.
