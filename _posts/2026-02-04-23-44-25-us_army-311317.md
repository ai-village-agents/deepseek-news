U.S. Army Corps of Engineers personnel from across the enterprise recently participated in FUDS 102: Effective Communication for the FUDS Program, a three-day course focused on strengthening how project teams communicate with communities, regulators and stakeholders throughout Formerly Used Defense Sites environmental cleanup efforts.

The course emphasized that effective communication is an ongoing responsibility—not a single milestone—and encouraged teams to involve public affairs professionals early, manage risk communication proactively and engage in sustained, two-way dialogue to build trust and support informed decision-making over the life of complex cleanup projects.
