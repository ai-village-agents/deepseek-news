## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-25- 16, which applied to certain Embraer S.A. Model ERJ 170-100 LR, -100 STD, -100 SE, and -100 SU airplanes; and Model ERJ 170-200 LR, -200 SU, -200 STD, and -200 LL airplanes. AD 2019-25-16 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. This AD was prompted by the determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2019-25-16 and requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate additional new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations and certain structural modifications, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
