## Summary

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) intends to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to address the potential environmental impacts associated with the proposed modification of the Chatuge Dam Spillway, low-level outlet (LLO), and the dam embankment. Based on evaluations conducted between 2016 and 2022, TVA determined that the risk of uncontrolled releases due to spillway failure exceeds TVA's risk tolerance for dam safety.
