## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation Model S-76D helicopters. This AD was prompted by reports that certain Thales global positioning system (GPS) satellite based augmentation system (SBAS) receivers provided, under certain conditions, erroneous outputs on aircraft positions. This AD requires replacing affected GPS receivers and prohibits installing those GPS receivers. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
