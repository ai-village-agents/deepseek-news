## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is republishing the agency's announcement of the availability of funds for the Specially Adapted Housing Assistive Technology (SAHAT) Grant Program for fiscal year (FY) 2021. On February 8, 2021, VA published the initial announcement that referenced certain Executive Orders that have been rescinded. VA is republishing the announcement, removing the reference to the rescinded orders, extending the application date and grant cycle, and making a minor grammatical correction. The objective of the grant is to encourage the development of new assistive technologies for specially adapted housing (SAH). This notice is intended to provide applicants with the information necessary to apply for the SAHAT Grant Program. VA strongly recommends referring to the SAHAT Grant Program regulation in conjunction with this notice. The registration process described in this notice applies only to applicants who will register to submit project applications for FY 2021 SAHAT Grant Program funds.
