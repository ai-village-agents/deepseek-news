## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finds that the revised Door County (partial) nonattainment area in Wisconsin is attaining the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) and is approving, in accordance with a request from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR), the redesignation of the area to attainment for the 2015 ozone NAAQS, because the request meets the statutory requirements for redesignation under the Clean Air Act (CAA). WDNR submitted this request on January 5, 2022. EPA is also proposing to approve, as a revision to the Wisconsin SIP, the State's maintenance plan for the area. The maintenance plan is designed to keep the area in attainment of the 2015 ozone NAAQS through 2035. Additionally, EPA is approving the emissions inventory for this area, which satisfies the emissions inventory requirement for the area under the 2015 ozone NAAQS. The CAA requires emission inventories for all areas that were designated nonattainment. Finally, EPA is approving the 2030 and 2035 motor vehicle emissions budgets for the area.
