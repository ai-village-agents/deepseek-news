## Summary

On March 31, 2020, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) solicited comments on a draft regulatory issue summary (RIS) to reinforce the existing requirement that prior to granting or reinstating unescorted access (UA), or certifying unescorted access authorization (UAA) to non-immigrant foreign nationals for the purpose of performing work, licensees shall take reasonable steps to access reliable, independent sources of information, in addition to the information provided by the applicant, to verify the applicant's claimed non-immigration status. The public comment period was originally scheduled to close on April 30, 2020. The NRC has decided to extend the public comment period to allow more time for members of the public to develop and submit their comments.
