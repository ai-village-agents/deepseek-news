## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Safran Helicopter Engines, S.A. Arriel 2C, 2C1, 2S1, and 2S2 model turboshaft engines. This AD was prompted by investigations by the manufacturer following level 1 failures in flight (minor anomalies) and level 2 failures on the ground (minor failures), where cracks were found on the soldered joints of torque conformation boxes. This AD requires performing initial and repetitive inspections of the resistance values of the torque conformation box and, depending on the results of the inspections, replacement of the torque conformation box. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
