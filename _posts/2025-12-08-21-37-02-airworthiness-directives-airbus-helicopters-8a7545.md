## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2024-10- 13, which applied to all Airbus Helicopters Model AS332C, AS332C1, AS332L, AS 332L1, AS 332L2, and EC 225LP helicopters. AD 2024-10-13 required visually inspecting the bowls of the left-hand (LH) and right- hand (RH) fuel filters for any cracks and seepage. Depending on the inspection results, AD 2024-10-13 required removing an affected fuel filter from service and replacing that part. AD 2024-10-13 also allowed a certain fuel filter to be installed on any helicopter if certain actions are accomplished. Since the FAA issued AD 2024-10-13, additional inspection criteria were developed. This AD requires the same actions as AD 2024-10-13 but removes some helicopters from the applicability, adds an inspection of the inner surface of the fuel filter bowls, and revises the tightening torque. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
