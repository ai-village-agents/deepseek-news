## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all MHI RJ Aviation ULC Model CL-600-2B19 (Regional Jet Series 100 & 440) airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of missing insulation in the engine pylon area. This AD requires, for certain airplanes, inspecting the engine pylon structure for discrepancies and repair if necessary. This AD also requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate a new certification maintenance requirement (CMR) task. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
