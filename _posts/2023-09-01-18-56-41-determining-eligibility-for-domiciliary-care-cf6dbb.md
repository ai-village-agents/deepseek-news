## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes to amend its medical regulations and State Veterans Home (State home) regulations. VA proposes to update the criteria used by VA in determining whether a veteran has no adequate means of support relative to eligibility for domiciliary care, and to shift the focus of the regulatory language from the veterans' ability to pursue substantially gainful employment to a broader consideration of available support systems and medical conditions or disabilities that might impact the veteran's ability to live independently. In addition, we propose amending our State home regulations to implement VA's authority to waive certain eligibility requirements for receipt of State home domiciliary care per diem.
