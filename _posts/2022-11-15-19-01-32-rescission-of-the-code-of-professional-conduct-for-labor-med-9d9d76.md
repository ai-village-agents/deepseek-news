## Summary

On April 6, 1966, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) published a final rule adopting a Code of Professional Conduct for Labor Mediators. After careful review, FMCS finds that this rule is no longer suitable for publication. Therefore, this final rule rescinds the appendix regarding the Code of Professional Conduct for Labor Mediators.
