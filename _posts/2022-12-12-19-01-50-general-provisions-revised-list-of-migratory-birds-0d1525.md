## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to revise the List of Birds protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) by both adding and removing species. Reasons for the changes to the list include adding species based on new taxonomy and new evidence of natural occurrence in the United States or U.S. territories, removing species no longer known to occur within the United States or U.S. territories, and changing names to conform to accepted use. The net increase of 13 species (16 added and three removed) would bring the total number of species protected by the MBTA to 1,106. We also propose to revise the scientific name of a species subject to specific migratory-bird-permit regulations and to revise corresponding entries for several migratory bird species that are also listed on the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife under the Endangered Species Act to reflect currently accepted taxonomy and nomenclature. We regulate the taking, possession, transportation, sale, purchase, barter, exportation, and importation of migratory birds. An accurate and up-to-date list of species protected by the MBTA is essential for public notification, regulatory, and law- enforcement purposes. These revisions would also ensure consistency in the use of common and scientific names across Service regulations.
