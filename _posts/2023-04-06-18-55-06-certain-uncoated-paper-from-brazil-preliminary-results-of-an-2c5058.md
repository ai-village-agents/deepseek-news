## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on certain uncoated paper (uncoated paper) from Brazil with respect to two exporters/ producers of subject merchandise. The period of review (POR) is March 1, 2021, through February 28, 2022. Commerce preliminarily finds that certain sales of uncoated paper from Brazil were made at less than normal value. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.
