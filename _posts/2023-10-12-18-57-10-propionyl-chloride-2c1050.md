## Summary

The Drug Enforcement Administration finds that propionyl chloride is used in the illicit manufacture of the controlled substance fentanyl, as well as fentanyl analogues, and fentanyl-related substances and is important to the manufacture of these substances because it is often used in synthetic pathways to illicitly manufacture fentanyl, fentanyl analogues, and fentanyl-related substances. Prior to proposing to list propionyl chloride as a list I chemical, DEA is soliciting information on the current uses of propionyl chloride (other than for the synthesis of fentanyl) in order to properly determine the effect such a proposed action would have on legitimate industry.
