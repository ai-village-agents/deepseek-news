## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency) is announcing the termination of the Board of Tea Experts by the Federal Tea Tasters Repeal Act of 1996. This document removes the Board of Tea Experts from the Agency's list of standing advisory committees. FDA is also updating the statutory citation to the Federal Advisory Committee Act to reflect recodification. This technical change aligns with the desire of Congress to incorporate various provisions that were enacted separately over a period of years; reorganize them; conforming style and terminology; modernizing obsolete language; and correcting drafting errors to remove ambiguities, contradictions, and other imperfections without changing the meaning of or effect of existing law.
