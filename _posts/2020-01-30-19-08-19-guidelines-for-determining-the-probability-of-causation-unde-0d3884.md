# Guidelines for Determining the Probability of Causation Under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000; Technical Amendments

**Published:** February 05, 2026 19:08 UTC

**Document Number:** 2020-00636

## Summary

In August 2019, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published an interim final rule to revise its regulations to update references to the International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM, and remove outdated references to chronic lymphocytic leukemia from Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program regulations. These technical amendments have no effect on the cancer eligibility requirement under the Program because all cancer types are eligible to receive a dose reconstruction from NIOSH. Thus, no eligible claimant will be adversely impacted by the rulemaking finalized in this document.
