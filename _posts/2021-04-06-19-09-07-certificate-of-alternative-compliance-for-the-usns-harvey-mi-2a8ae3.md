## Summary

The Coast Guard announces that the Eleventh Coast Guard District's Prevention Division has issued a certificate of alternative compliance from the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), for the USNS HARVEY MILK (O.N. CG1473700) and USNS EARL WARREN (O.N. CG1473701). We are issuing this notice because its publication is required by statute. Due to the design and operation of the ship's whistles, USNS HARVEY MILK and USNS EARL WARREN cannot fully comply with the light, shape, or sound signal provisions of the 72 COLREGS without interfering with the design and construction of each vessel. This notification of issuance of a certificate of alternative compliance promotes the Coast Guard's marine safety mission.
