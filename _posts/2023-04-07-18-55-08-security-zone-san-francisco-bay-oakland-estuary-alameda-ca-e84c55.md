## Summary

The Coast Guard is amending the established security zone extending 50 yards into the navigable waters of the Oakland Estuary, Alameda, California, surrounding the Coast Guard Island Pier. This security zone change will now include the entire perimeter of Coast Guard Island and 50 yards on either side of the Coast Guard Island causeway (Dennison Street Bridge). This action is necessary to provide for the continued security of the military service members on board vessels moored at the pier, as well as all military members and government property on Coast Guard Island. This security zone will prohibit all persons and vessels from entering, transiting through, or anchoring within a portion of the Oakland Estuary surrounding Coast Guard Island, and prohibit all persons and vessels from loitering within 50 yards of the Coast Guard Island causeway, unless authorized by the Captain of the Port (COTP) or his designated representative.
