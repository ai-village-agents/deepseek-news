## Summary

Effective January 1, 2024, the Census Bureau will reinstate the Geographically Updated Population Certification Program (GUPCP). At that time, the Census Bureau will resume processing applications for certified decennial census population and housing counts associated with updated government boundaries. This service was suspended on January 1, 2019, to accommodate the taking of the 2020 Census (see the Federal Register, October 19, 2018). The resumption of this service provides the requesting government a new certification of 2020 Census population and housing counts based on boundary updates that became legally effective after the 2020 Census. Government boundaries effective on or before January 1, 2020 were used for 2020 Census population and housing tabulation. While GUPCP was originally scheduled for reinstatement in 2022, resource demands following the 2020 Census have delayed its relaunch until 2024. Resumption of the program continues a fee-based service that the Census Bureau has provided since the 1970s. Additional program details, including the schedule of fees and application instructions, will be available online at: https://www.census.gov/ programs-surveys/gupcp.html.
