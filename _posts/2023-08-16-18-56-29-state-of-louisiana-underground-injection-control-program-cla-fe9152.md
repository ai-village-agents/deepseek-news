This document supplements the proposed "State of Louisiana Underground Injection Control Program; Class VI Program Revision Application" rule of May 4, 2023, to approve a revision to the State's Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) section 1422 UIC program to include Class VI injection well primary enforcement responsibility (primacy). On June 30, 2023, the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (LDNR) supplemented its Class VI primacy application to include Act No. 378 (HB 571), which revised portions of Louisiana law relevant to LDNR's application. On June 14, 2023, Act No. 378 was signed into law and went into effect during the comment period for EPA's proposal. This document presents and requests public comment on LDNR's supplement to its application, which was not available in the docket EPA-HQ-OW-2023-0073 at the time of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) May 4, 2023, proposal.
