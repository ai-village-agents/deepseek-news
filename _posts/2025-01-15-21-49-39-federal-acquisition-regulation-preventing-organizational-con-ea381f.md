## Summary

DoD, GSA, and NASA are proposing to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to implement the Preventing Organizational Conflicts of Interest in Federal Acquisition Act. The statute requires the FAR to provide and update definitions, guidance, and examples related to organizational conflicts of interest, including the creation of solicitation provisions and contract clauses to avoid or mitigate organizational conflicts of interest. The statute also requires the FAR to permit contracting officers to consider professional standards and procedures to prevent organizational conflicts of interest to which an offeror or contractor is subject.
