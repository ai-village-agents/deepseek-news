## Summary

Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on June 30, 2023, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of JUUL Labs, Inc. of Washington, DC and VMR Products LLC of San Francisco, California. A letter supplementing the complaint was filed on July 17, 2023. The complaint, as supplemented, alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain vaporizer devices, cartridges used therewith, and components thereof by reason of the infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. RE49,114 ("the '114 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 10,130,123 ("the '123 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 10,709,173 ("the '173 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 11,134,722 ("the '722 patent"); and U.S. Patent No. 11,606,981 ("the '981 patent"). The complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The complainants request that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a limited exclusion order and cease and desist orders.
