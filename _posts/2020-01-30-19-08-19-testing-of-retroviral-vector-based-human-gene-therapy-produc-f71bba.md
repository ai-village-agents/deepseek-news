## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance entitled "Testing of Retroviral Vector-Based Human Gene Therapy Products for Replication Competent Retrovirus During Product Manufacture and Patient Follow-up; Guidance for Industry." The guidance provides sponsors of retroviral vector-based human gene therapy products recommendations regarding the testing for replication competent retrovirus (RCR) during the manufacture of retroviral vector-based gene therapy products, and during follow-up monitoring of patients who have received retroviral vector-based gene therapy products. Recommendations include the identification and amount of material to be tested, and general testing methods. In addition, recommendations are provided on monitoring patients for evidence of retroviral infection after administration of retroviral vector-based gene therapy products. The guidance supersedes the document entitled "Guidance for Industry: Supplemental Guidance on Testing for Replication Competent Retrovirus in Retroviral Vector Based Gene Therapy Products and During Follow-up of Patients in Clinical Trials Using Retroviral Vectors," dated November 2006. The guidance announced in this notice finalizes the draft guidance of the same title dated July 2018.
