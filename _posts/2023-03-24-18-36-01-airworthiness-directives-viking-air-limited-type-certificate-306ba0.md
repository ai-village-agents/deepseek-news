## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Viking Air Limited (type certificate previously held by Bombardier Inc. and de Havilland Inc.) Model DHC-2 Mk. I airplanes with Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) No. SA01324CH installed. This AD was prompted by a report of damage in the main wing spar. This AD requires inspecting the wing structure for damage (drill starts, corrosion, cracks, and improperly installed fasteners), repairing damage, and reporting the inspection results if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
