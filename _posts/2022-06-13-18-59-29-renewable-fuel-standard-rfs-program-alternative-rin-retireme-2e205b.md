## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing an alternative renewable identification number (RIN) retirement schedule for small refineries under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program for the 2020 compliance year. To provide small refineries with more time to comply with their 2020 RFS obligations (including any RIN deficits from 2019 carried forward into the 2020 compliance year), EPA is proposing a quarterly RIN retirement schedule by which a small refinery must comply with certain percentages of its 2020 RFS obligations. EPA is proposing this action because small refineries need more time to plan for compliance with their RFS obligations given EPA's delay in deciding small refinery exemption (SRE) petitions and setting the associated compliance deadlines.
