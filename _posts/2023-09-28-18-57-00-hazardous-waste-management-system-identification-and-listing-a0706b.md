## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to grant an exclusion from the list of hazardous wastes to WRB Refining LP (Petitioner) located in Borger, Texas. This action responds to a petition to exclude (or "delist") up to 7,000 cubic yards per year of solids removed from four stormwater tanks from the list of federal hazardous wastes when disposed of in a Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA) Subtitle D Landfill. The EPA is proposing to grant the petition based on an evaluation of waste-specific information provided by the Petitioner. A previous proposed action was published in the Federal Register on November 23, 2022, that proposed to grant this petition (see Docket ID Number EPA-R06-RCRA-2022-0653). However, after the proposed rule was published, EPA received notification during the public comment period from the Petitioner that the table detailing the delisting constituents and levels was incorrect. After review, EPA agreed that the information contained in the table in question was incorrect. EPA has corrected the table to reflect the appropriate constituents and values and is withdrawing the previously published proposed rule from November 23, 2022. EPA is issuing a new action proposing to grant the petition, which will include a new 30-day comment period.
