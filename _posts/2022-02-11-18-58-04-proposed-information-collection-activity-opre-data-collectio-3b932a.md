## Summary

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is requesting approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for a new primary data collection about connected child welfare data. We define connected data as child welfare data that are linked or integrated with data from other systems or agencies. The State Child Welfare Data Linkages Descriptive Study (Data Linkages Descriptive Study) will gather systematic information on the extent to which states connect their child maltreatment data to other data sets; how any linked data sets are created, managed, and used; and challenges states face in linking data.
