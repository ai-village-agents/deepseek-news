## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily determines that Fujian Jinquan Trade Co., Ltd./Baiyuan Wood Machining Co., Ltd. (Jinquan/Baiyuan) and 22 non-individually examined and separate-rate eligible exporters of wood mouldings and millwork products (millwork products) from the People's Republic of China (China) sold subject merchandise to the United States at prices below normal value (NV) during the period of review (POR), February 1, 2022, through January 31, 2023. Commerce also preliminarily determines that Fujian Yinfeng Imp & Exp Trading Co., Ltd./Fujian Province Youxi City Mangrove Wood Machining Co., Ltd. (Yinfeng/Mangrove) did not sell subject merchandise to the United States at prices below NV during the POR. We intend to rescind this review with respect to 12 companies for which the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data show no entries of the subject merchandise from these companies during the POR. Additionally, we are rescinding this administrative review with respect to seven companies because the requests for review for these companies were timely withdrawn. Finally, we preliminarily find that four companies are part of the China-wide entity. We invited interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.
