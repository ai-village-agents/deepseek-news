## Summary

The FAA is revising an earlier proposal to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-18-04, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This action revises the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) by requiring a modification (replacement of each affected slat power control unit (PCU) with a slat PCU having a different part number), requiring an inspection report, and revising the limitations on the installation of affected parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over those in the NPRM, the FAA is reopening the comment period to allow the public the chance to comment on these changes.
