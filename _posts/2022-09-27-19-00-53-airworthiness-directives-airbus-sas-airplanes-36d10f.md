## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A300 series airplanes; Model A300 B4-600, B4- 600R, and F4-600R series airplanes, and Model A300 C4-605R Variant F airplanes (collectively called Model A300-600 series airplanes); and Model A310 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that a Model A319 airplane lost the right-hand front windshield in flight. Due to the design similarity, this condition can also exist or develop on Model A300, A300-600, and A310 series airplanes. This proposed AD would require repetitive inspections and electrical test measurements (ETMs) of the affected parts, and applicable corrective actions, and would prohibit the installation of affected parts under certain conditions; as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
