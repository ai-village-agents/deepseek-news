## Summary

The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS), invites the public and other Federal Agencies to take this opportunity to comment on the following information collection request, Arbitrator's Personal Data Questionnaire, FMCS Form R-22. This information collection request will be submitted for approval to the Office of Management Budget (OMB) in compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). The Arbitrator's Personal Data Questionnaire, FMCS Form R-22, allows FMCS to comply with its statutory obligation to make governmental facilities available for voluntary arbitration. To carry out this policy, FMCS have issued regulations which provide for the operation and maintenance of a roster of professional arbitrators. The arbitrators are private citizens, not employees of FMCS, and are paid by the parties for hearing and deciding the issues submitted under a collective bargaining agreement and in other circumstances. Applicants for listing on the roster submit an Arbitrator's Personal Data Questionnaire, FMCS Form R-22, which is used by FMCS to evaluate their qualifications. This allows FMCS to be able to restrict its roster to qualified individuals only.
