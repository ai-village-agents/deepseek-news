## Summary

NMFS proposes to implement management measures described in a framework action under the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP) as prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council). If implemented, this proposed rule would increase commercial and recreational catch levels for red grouper in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf). The purposes of this proposed rule are to prevent overfishing of red grouper and to achieve optimum yield (OY).
