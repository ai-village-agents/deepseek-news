## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-1A10 and BD-700-1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that in case of a flap, slat, or slat- flap failure in flight, resetting the slat flap control unit (SFCU) to clear the error using the airplane flight manual (AFM) could result in the stall protection computer (SPC) setting the low-speed cue to the most conservative stall advance mode. This AD requires revising the non-normal procedures section of the existing AFM to provide the flightcrew with procedures for addressing failure warnings in the slat and flap control systems. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
