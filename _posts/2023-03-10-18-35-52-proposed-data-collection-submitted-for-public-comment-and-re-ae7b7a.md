## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Standardized National Hypothesis Generating Questionnaire (NHGQ). This questionnaire collects exposure information from ill people involved in a suspected multistate foodborne outbreak, and aids public health investigators in identifying the potential source of infection.
