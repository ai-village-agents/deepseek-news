## Summary

This is a notice of intent to award supplemental funding to the 13 Mental Health Technology Transfer Center (MHTTC) Cooperative Agreement recipients funded in FY 2018 under Funding Opportunity Announcement SM-18-015. This is to inform the public that the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is supporting one-year administrative supplements up to $304,081 per recipient. This supplement will provide continued direct technical assistance (TA) and training on the implementation and delivery of mental health services in schools and school systems, including training and TA provided to Project AWARE grantees. This will involve not only TA to the general field but provision of direct and tailored TA to grantees on school-based mental health services implementation. This is not a formal request for application. Assistance will only be provided to the Mental Health Technology Transfer Center Cooperative Agreement grant recipients based on receipt of a satisfactory application and associated budget. These recipients were funded in FY 2018 under the Mental Health Technology Transfer Center Cooperative Agreement Funding Opportunity Announcement SM-18-015 with a project end date of August 29, 2023.
