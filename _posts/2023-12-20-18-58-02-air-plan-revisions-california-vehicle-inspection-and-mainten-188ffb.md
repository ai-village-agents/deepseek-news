## Summary

Under the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act"), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern an amendment to the California motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program (also referred to as "Smog Check") to include a contingency measure that, if triggered, would narrow the Smog Check inspection exemption for newer model year vehicles in certain California nonattainment areas. The EPA is proposing to approve, as part of the California SIP, the contingency measure and a related statutory provision that authorizes the contingency measure because they meet all the applicable requirements. We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
