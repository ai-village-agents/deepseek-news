## Summary

On July 13, 2022, we, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), proposed to delist the Puerto Rican boa (Chilabothrus inornatus, but listed as Epicrates inornatus), an endemic snake from Puerto Rico. We announced a 60-day public comment period on the proposed rule, ending September 12, 2022. We are reopening the comment period for 30 days to hold a public hearing and to allow all interested parties additional time to comment on our proposal. Comments previously submitted will be fully considered in preparation of the final rule and do not need to be resubmitted.
