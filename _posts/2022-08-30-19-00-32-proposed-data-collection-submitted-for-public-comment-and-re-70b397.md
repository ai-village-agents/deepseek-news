## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Evaluation of Safe Spaces in CDC- directly funded Community-based Organizations (CBOs). This project is designed to collect data from persons attending safe spaces, CBO staff perceptions of safe spaces, and descriptions of those spaces selected from 10 CBOs funded through Comprehensive High-Impact HIV Prevention Programs for young men of Color who have sex with men and young transgender persons of Color.
