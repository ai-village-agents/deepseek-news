## Summary

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recently issued a final rule that revised the migratory bird subsistence harvest regulations in Alaska. The final rule included an improperly worded amendatory instruction that resulted in the unintentional removal of regulatory text. This document corrects that inadvertent error and restores the regulations to their proper wording.
