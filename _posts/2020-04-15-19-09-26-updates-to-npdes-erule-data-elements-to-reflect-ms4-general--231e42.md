## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is updating specific data elements within the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Electronic Reporting Rule (NPDES eRule), published on October 22, 2015, that apply to regulated municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s). These changes are necessary given the promulgation of a separate rulemaking after publication of the NPDES eRule that modified the NPDES permit requirements for small MS4s. That rule, referred to as the MS4 General Permit Remand Rule, published on December 9, 2016, made a number of the MS4-related data elements in the NPDES eRule no longer accurate. This final rule updates those data elements to be consistent with the current MS4 regulations, corrects related typographical errors, and makes other selected clarifications at the request of state NPDES permitting programs.
