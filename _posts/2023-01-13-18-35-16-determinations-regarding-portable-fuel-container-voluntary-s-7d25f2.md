## Summary

The Portable Fuel Container Safety Act of 2020 (PFCSA) provides that the Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission) must promulgate a rule to require flame mitigation devices in portable fuel containers that impede the propagation of flame into the container, unless the Commission determines that there is a voluntary standard for flame mitigation devices that impedes the propagation of flame into the container. The Commission is announcing in this document that it has determined that such voluntary standards exist for all known classes of portable fuel containers. Therefore, the Commission will not be promulgating a final rule, and pursuant to the PFCSA, the requirements of such voluntary standards shall be treated as a consumer product safety rule under the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA).
