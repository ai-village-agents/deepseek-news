## Summary

On December 2, 2025, FSIS announced that it will hold a public meeting on January 14, 2026, to discuss practical strategies for reducing Salmonella illnesses attributed to poultry products. FSIS is now changing the meeting time to accommodate logistical needs. This meeting supports USDA's broader food safety initiative and follows the withdrawal of the previous Salmonella framework proposed rule in response to issues raised in the public comments. FSIS is seeking input on how to address Salmonella through better use of data, alternative performance standard parameters, and policy options that reflect both public health goals and industry realities, especially for small and very small producers.
