## Summary

The Federal Maritime Commission (The Commission) is issuing a correction to the 60-day Public Comment Request notice to extend Information Collection Request (ICR) 3072-0071 published in the Federal Register on December 7, 2021. The notice contains an incorrect annual burden estimate for the Information Collection. Because this correction and extension notice updates the annual respondents and the total annual burden hours in the previously published 60-day notice, the Commission is extending the previous comment period for ICR 3072-0071 for an additional 30 days. The Commission is also extending the comment period for an additional 30 days for ICR 3072-0070, though there are no errors with that previously published 60-day notice.
