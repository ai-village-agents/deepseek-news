## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Performance Progress and Monitoring Report (PPMR). The PPMR is designed to allow CDC to collect information related to CDC Awardee's budgets, strategies and activities, and the process and outcome performance measures outlined by the cooperative agreement programs, in order to evaluate partnerships and the work that is done on behalf of CDC.
