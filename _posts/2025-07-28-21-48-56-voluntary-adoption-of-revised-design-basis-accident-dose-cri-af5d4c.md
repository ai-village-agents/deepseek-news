## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is denying a petition for rulemaking, dated November 23, 2019, submitted by John G. Parillo. The petition requested that the NRC develop a rule that would allow nuclear power plant licensees to voluntarily adopt a revised accident dose acceptance criteria for the control room, exclusion area boundary, and the low population zone outer boundary. The petition further requested revisions to clarify footnotes discussing these dose acceptance criteria in the applicable regulations. The NRC docketed the petition on February 19, 2020, and assigned it Docket No. PRM-50-121. The NRC is denying the petition because the information presented does not support rulemaking and the proposed changes are not necessary to provide reasonable assurance of adequate protection of public health and safety.
