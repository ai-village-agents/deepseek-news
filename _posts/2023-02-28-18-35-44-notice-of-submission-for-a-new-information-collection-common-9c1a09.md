## Summary

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is notifying the general public and other Federal agencies that OPM proposes to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approve a new information collection request (ICR) titled Personnel Vetting Questionnaire (PVQ). The proposed information collection will streamline multiple existing information collections, as well as the renewal cycle for them, commensurate with on-going efforts to improve personnel vetting processes and the experience of individuals undergoing personnel vetting. OPM is proposing to discontinue the information collections for OMB control numbers 3206-0261, 3206-0258, and 3206-0005 as these information collections will become parts of the new Personnel Vetting Questionnaire information collection and assigned a new OMB control number.
