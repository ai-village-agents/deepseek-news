## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-19-16, which applies to all CFM International, S.A. (CFM) Model LEAP-1A23, -1A24, -1A24E1, -1A26, -1A26E1, -1A26CJ, -1A29, -1A29CJ, - 1A30, -1A32, -1A33, -1A33B2, and -1A35A engines with certain full authority digital engine control (FADEC) and prognostic health monitoring (PHM) software installed. AD 2018-19-16 requires removing certain FADEC and PHM software and installing versions eligible for installation. Since the FAA issued AD 2018-19-16, the manufacturer has developed a new pressure subsystem (PSS) with a heater element to evaporate potential moisture on the PSS manifold/transducer interface and prevent freezing at low temperature. This proposed AD would require replacing certain FADEC and PHM software with new versions that are eligible for installation, replacement of certain harnesses with newly designed harnesses, and replacement of the PSS with a newly designed heated PSS. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
