VICENZA, Italy — The 173rd Airborne Brigade continues to sharpen the edge of its future leadership with a squad leader academy, a weeklong course designed to prepare emerging noncommissioned officers to lead Soldiers in complex, uncertain environments, Jan. 23-30, 2026.

The academy blended rigorous troop leading procedures, maintenance standards and small-unit tactics with a deliberate focus on character, competence and the hard-earned lessons of the brigade’s storied past.

The course, led by 2nd Battalion, 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment, “The Rock,” brought together up‑and‑coming squad leaders for intensive instruction on planning and executing squad‑level operations. Training included daily physical readiness sessions from the U.S. Army Holistic Health and Fitness program. Instructors from across the battalion reinforced standards and evaluated students throughout the week, ensuring each leader met the expectations required of a Sky Soldier noncommissioned officer.
