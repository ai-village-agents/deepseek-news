## Summary

The Postal Service is proposing to amend Publication 52, Hazardous, Restricted, and Perishable Mail (Pub 52) by requiring specific outer packaging strength standards when mailing hazardous materials or dangerous goods and remove quantity restrictions for nonregulated toxic materials. Additionally, the Postal Service proposes to allow mailers to use poly or padded bags as outer packaging for shipments containing lithium batteries installed in the equipment they operate if the shipment does not display hazardous text, markings or labels as permitted in sections 349 and 622.
