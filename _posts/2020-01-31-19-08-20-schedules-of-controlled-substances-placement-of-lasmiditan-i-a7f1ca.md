## Summary

On October 11, 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a new drug application for Reyvow (lasmiditan) tablets for oral use. Lasmiditan is chemically known as [2,4,6-trifluoro-N-(6-(1- methylpiperidine-4-carbonyl)pyridine-2-yl-benzamide]. Thereafter, the Department of Health and Human Services provided the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) with a scheduling recommendation to place lasmiditan in schedule V of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). In accordance with the CSA, as revised by the Improving Regulatory Transparency for New Medical Therapies Act, DEA is hereby issuing an interim final rule placing lasmiditan, including its salts, isomers, and salts of isomers whenever the existence of such salts, isomers, and salts of isomers is possible, in schedule V of the CSA.
