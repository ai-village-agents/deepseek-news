## Summary

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is rescinding and removing its regulation titled "Nondiscrimination Requirements" and amending its regulation titled "Fair Housing" to make it applicable to State savings associations. These actions will streamline the FDIC's rules by eliminating unnecessary, inconsistent, and duplicative regulations, and ensure insured State nonmember banks and State savings associations generally will be subject to the same nondiscrimination requirements.
