## Summary

Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Small Business Administration (SBA) seek to participate in an updated computer matching program governed by a computer matching agreement to share and compare federal records regarding financial/benefits award decisions of individuals, businesses, and/or other entities to (1) connect survivors with SBA for disaster assistance, (2) prevent duplicative aid from being provided in response to the same disaster or emergency and recover aid when the comparison identifies a duplication of benefits, and (3) provide updates on SBA loan status in DHS/FEMA's Individual Assistance System. The current computer matching program between DHS/FEMA and SBA (the agencies) will expire on August 21, 2025. The agencies propose reestablishing the computer matching program, with changes to the purpose for the agreement and to the method of data transport, for an additional 18 months.
