## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), designate critical habitat for the Florida bonneted bat (Eumops floridanus) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. In total, approximately 1,160,625 acres (469,688 hectares) in 13 Florida counties fall within the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. This rule extends the Act's protections to this species' critical habitat.
