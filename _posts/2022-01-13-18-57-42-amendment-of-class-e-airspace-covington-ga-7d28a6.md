## Summary

This action amends Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface for Covington Municipal Airport, Covington, GA. This action is the result of an airspace review caused by the decommissioning of the ALCOVY Non-directional Beacon (NDB) and cancellation of the associated approaches. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.
