## Summary

This action amends Jet Route J-64, VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-50, V-71, V-216, and V-307, and Area Navigation (RNAV) route T-286; establishes RNAV route T-468; and revokes J-130, J- 192, V-553, and the Pawnee City, NE, low altitude reporting point. The FAA is taking this action due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Pawnee City, NE, VOR/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) navigational aid (NAVAID). The Pawnee City VOR is being decommissioned in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
