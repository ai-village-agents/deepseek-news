## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-18- 09, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A319-111, -112, -113, - 114, -115, -131, -132, and -133; A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, - 232, -233, -251N, and -271N; and A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, - 213, -231, -232, -251N, and -253N airplanes. AD 2022-18-09 continued to require the actions in AD 2019-26-01 and AD 2021-23-15, and added airplanes to the applicability. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-18-09, it was determined that additional airplanes and galleys are subject to the unsafe condition, and a compliance time for certain airplanes should be extended. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2022-18-09 and requires expanding the applicability, obtaining and following additional instructions for certain modified airplanes, and extending the compliance time for certain airplanes, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
