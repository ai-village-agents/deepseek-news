## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA or Act), the EPA is proposing to approve elements of two State Implementation Plan (SIP) submittals from Louisiana for the 2015 ozone (O<INF>3</INF>) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The submittals address how the existing SIP provides for the implementation, maintenance and enforcement of the 2015 ozone NAAQS (infrastructure SIP or i-SIP). The i-SIP ensures that the Louisiana SIP is adequate to meet the state's responsibilities under the CAA for this NAAQS.
