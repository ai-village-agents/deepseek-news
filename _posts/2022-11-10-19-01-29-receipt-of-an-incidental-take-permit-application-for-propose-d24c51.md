## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, have received an application from Consumers Energy for an incidental take permit under the Endangered Species Act. If approved, the permit would authorize the incidental take of a federally threatened species, the eastern massasauga rattlesnake (Sistrurus catenatus; EMR). The applicant has prepared a habitat conservation plan in support of their application. We have made a preliminary determination that the HCP and permit application are eligible for categorical exclusion under the National Environmental Policy Act. We invite comments from the public and Federal, Tribal, State, and local governments.
