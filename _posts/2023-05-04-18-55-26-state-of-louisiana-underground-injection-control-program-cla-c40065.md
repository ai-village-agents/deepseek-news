## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) has received a complete Underground Injection Control (UIC) program revision package from the State of Louisiana (State), requesting approval of a revision to the State's Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) section 1422 UIC program to include Class VI injection well primary enforcement responsibility (primacy). The proposed revision would allow the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (LDNR) to issue UIC permits for geologic carbon sequestration facilities as Class VI wells and ensure compliance of Class VI wells under the UIC program. EPA proposes to issue a final rule approving Louisiana's application to implement the UIC program for Class VI injection wells located within the State, except those on Indian lands. EPA proposes amendments to reflect this proposed approval of Louisiana's Class VI primacy application.
