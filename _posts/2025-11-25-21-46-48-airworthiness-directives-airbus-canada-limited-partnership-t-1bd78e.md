## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500-1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by events where the cargo bottle fail caution message was displayed. This AD requires replacing affected low rate discharge (LRD) bottles, inspecting extinguishing discharge lines and tubes, and replacing extinguishing discharge lines and tubes, as applicable, and also prohibits the installation of affected LRD bottles. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
