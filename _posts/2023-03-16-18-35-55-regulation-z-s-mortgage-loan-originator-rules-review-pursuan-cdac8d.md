## Summary

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB or Bureau) is conducting a review of Regulation Z's Mortgage Loan Originator Rules (Loan Originator Rules) pursuant to section 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), among other things, imposes certain requirements on: loan originator compensation; qualification of, and registration or licensing of, loan originators; compliance procedures for depository institutions; mandatory arbitration; and the financing of single premium credit insurance. As part of this review, the Bureau is seeking comment on the economic impact of the Loan Originator Rules on small entities. These comments may assist the Bureau in determining whether the Loan Originator Rules should be continued without change or amended or rescinded to minimize any significant economic impact of the rules upon a substantial number of such small entities, consistent with the stated objectives of applicable Federal statutes.
