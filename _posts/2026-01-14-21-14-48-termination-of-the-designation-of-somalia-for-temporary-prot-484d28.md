## Summary

Through this notice, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announces that the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) is terminating the designation of Somalia for Temporary Protected Status. The designation of Somalia is set to expire on March 17, 2026. After reviewing country conditions and consulting with appropriate U.S. Government agencies, the Secretary determined that Somalia no longer continues to meet the conditions for designation for Temporary Protected Status. The Secretary, therefore, is terminating the Temporary Protected Status designation of Somalia as required by statute. This termination is effective March 17, 2026. After March 17, 2026, nationals of Somalia (and aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in Somalia) who have been granted Temporary Protected Status under Somalia's designation will no longer have Temporary Protected Status.
