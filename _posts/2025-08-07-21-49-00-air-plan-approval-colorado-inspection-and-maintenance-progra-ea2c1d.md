## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Colorado through the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) on May 16, 2022. The revision includes changes to the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission's Regulation Number 11, "Motor Vehicle Emissions Inspection Program." The submitted changes constitute a revision to Colorado's vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) SIP. Colorado's I/M SIP revision includes several minor clerical and typographical revisions. The I/M SIP revision also streamlines the visual inspection procedures used on subject vehicles in obtaining I/M program emissions certification compliance and vehicle registration renewal. CDPHE also submitted revisions to its I/M program regulations which were marked as "state only" revisions and not meant for EPA consideration. The EPA is not acting upon these state-only changes in this action.
