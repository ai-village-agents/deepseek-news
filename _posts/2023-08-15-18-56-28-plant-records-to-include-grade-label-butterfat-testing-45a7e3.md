## Summary

This document invites comments on a proposed amendment to the plant records requirement for the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) Dairy Grading and Inspection program. The proposal would allow butterfat tests to be performed at an in-house or approved third party laboratory and add a requirement for plants to maintain and make such records available for examination by a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) inspector. This amendment would increase efficiency by conforming to current industry practice.
