## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-22-11, which applies to certain Embraer S.A. (Embraer) Model EMB- 505 airplanes. AD 2023-22-11 requires repetitively replacing the clutch retaining bolt and washer of the aileron autopilot servo mount. Since the FAA issued AD 2023-22-11, the FAA has determined that the applicability should be expanded to include all Model EMB-505 airplanes and, for certain airplanes, an additional requirement is necessary for the initial replacement of the retaining bolt and washer. This proposed AD would also provide an optional terminating action for the repetitive retaining bolt and washer replacement. These actions are specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
