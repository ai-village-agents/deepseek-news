# Air Plan Approval; Arizona; Maricopa County Air Quality Department; Volatile Organic Compounds; Architectural Coatings

## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the Maricopa County Air Quality Department (MCAQD or "County") portion of the Arizona State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) from architectural coatings. Architectural coatings include house paints, stains, industrial maintenance coatings, traffic coatings, and other similar products. We are proposing to approve local rules to regulate these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act"). The revisions would update the Arizona SIP by replacing an outdated rule version with the current version in effect and would lower VOC emissions limits for some architectural coatings if contingency measures are triggered in the future. We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
