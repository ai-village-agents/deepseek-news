## Summary

NASA is proposing to amend the NASA Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (NFS) to add new text that requires covered contractors and subcontractors at all tiers to use electronic parts that are currently in production and purchased from the original manufacturers of the parts, their authorized dealers, or suppliers who obtain such parts exclusively from the original manufacturers of the parts or their authorized dealers. If the contractor does not purchase electronic parts as described above, they must purchase the parts from a NASA identified supplier or contractor-approved supplier. The contractor will then assume responsibility and be required to inspect, test and validate authentication of the parts. The contractor will also be required to obtain traceability information and provide this information to the contracting officer upon request. The selection of contractor-approved suppliers is subject to review and audit by the contracting officer.
