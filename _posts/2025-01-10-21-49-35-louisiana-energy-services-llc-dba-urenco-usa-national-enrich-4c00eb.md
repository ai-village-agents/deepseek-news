## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff accepted and docketed an application for the amendment of Special Nuclear Materials (SNM) License No. SNM-2010, submitted by Louisiana Energy Services, LLC, dba Urenco USA dated August 29, 2024. The license amendment request (LAR) would authorize the applicant to modify the National Enrichment Facility, located in Eunice, New Mexico to increase the enrichment limit for the on-site recycling and support systems from 5.5 weight percent Uranium 235 (U-235) to less than 10.0 weight percent U-235 (LEU+), and would remove interim controls that were established by a prior license amendment for segregation and storage of LEU+- exposed components removed from production systems. Because this amendment request contains Sensitive Unclassified Non-Safeguards Information (SUNSI), an order imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI and Safeguards Information (SGI) for contention preparation.
