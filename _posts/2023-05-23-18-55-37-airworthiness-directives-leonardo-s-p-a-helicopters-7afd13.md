## Summary

The FAA is superseding Emergency Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-07-51, which applied to all Leonardo S.p.a. Model AB139 and AW139 helicopters and which was previously sent to all known U.S. owners and operators of those helicopters. Emergency AD 2023-07-51 required inspecting for a gap between the main rotor (M/R) pitch link upper rod end assembly bearing and the pitch control lever assembly and, depending on the results, replacing or re-identifying the M/R pitch link upper rod end assembly. Emergency AD 2023-07-51 also prohibited installing an affected M/R pitch link upper rod end assembly. Since the FAA issued Emergency AD 2023-07-51, it has been determined that a gap between the M/R pitch link upper rod end assembly bearing and the pitch control lever assembly that is within a certain dimension tolerance is acceptable. This AD continues to require the actions in Emergency AD 2023-07-51, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference in this AD, but allows a gap of less than 0.5 mm. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
