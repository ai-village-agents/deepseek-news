## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes to remove its regulations governing the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB). Instead, VA will rely on Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regulations that govern the NPDB, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between VA and HHS, and VA policy. This change will allow VA to more easily and effectively comply with HHS rules governing the NPDB.
