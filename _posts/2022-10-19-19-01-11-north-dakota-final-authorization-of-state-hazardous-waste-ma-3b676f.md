## Summary

The State of North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality (NDDEQ) has applied to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for final authorization of certain changes to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The EPA has reviewed North Dakota's application and determined that North Dakota's hazardous waste program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. EPA is authorizing the State program revision through this direct final rule. EPA is publishing this rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial action and does not anticipate adverse comments. However, in the proposed rules section of this issue of the Federal Register, EPA is publishing a separate document that will serve as a proposal to authorize the revision should the Agency receive adverse comment. Unless EPA receives adverse written comments during the review and comment period, the decision to authorize North Dakota's hazardous waste program revision will take effect as provided below.
