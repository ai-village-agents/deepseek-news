## Summary

In accordance with the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended, and its implementing regulations, we, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), have developed draft revised marine mammal stock assessment reports (SARs) for the Chukchi/Bering Seas and Southern Beaufort Sea polar bear (Ursus maritimus) stocks in Alaska. We invite comments on the two draft revised SARs from the public and from Federal, Tribal, State, and local governments.
