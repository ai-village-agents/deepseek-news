## Summary

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing amendments to the Federal Government personnel vetting investigative and adjudicative processes for determining suitability and fitness. The purpose of OPM's work in this area is to establish requirements and standards for agencies to properly vet individuals to assess risk to the integrity and efficiency of the service. Nothing in this proposed rule shall be read in derogation of any individual's rights under Title VII. OPM is also proposing to update and streamline the language of several provisions to include conforming and minor editorial changes throughout.
