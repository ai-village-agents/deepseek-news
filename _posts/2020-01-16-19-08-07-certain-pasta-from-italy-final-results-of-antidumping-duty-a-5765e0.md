On September 12, 2019, the Department of Commerce (Commerce) published the preliminary results of the antidumping duty administrative review of certain pasta (pasta) from Italy. The period of review (POR) is July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018. As a result of our analysis of the comments and information received, these final results differ from the Preliminary Results with respect to Ghigi 1870 S.p.A. and Pasta Zara S.p.A. (collectively, Ghigi/Zara) and Industria Alimentare Colavita S.p.A. (Indalco). For the final weighted-average dumping margins, see the "Final Results of Review" section.
