# Fisheries of the Northeastern United States; Mid-Atlantic Blueline Tilefish and Golden Tilefish Fisheries; 2024 Specifications

## Summary

In this action, NMFS proposes to maintain status quo harvest limits for the 2024 golden tilefish and blueline tilefish fisheries north of the North Carolina/Virginia border, to shift the recreational season for blueline tilefish to May 15 through November 14, and to modify regulations to reflect the January 1 start date of the golden tilefish fishing year. The proposed action is necessary to establish allowable harvest levels and other management measures to prevent overfishing while allowing optimum yield, consistent with the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act and the Tilefish Fishery Management Plan.
