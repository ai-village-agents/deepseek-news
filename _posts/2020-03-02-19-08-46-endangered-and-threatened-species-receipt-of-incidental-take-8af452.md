## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, have received an application from the Pacific Gas and Electric Company for a permit to conduct activities with the potential to take listed species that is incidental to, and not the purpose of, carrying out otherwise lawful activities. With some exceptions, the Endangered Species Act prohibits certain activities that may impact listed species unless a Federal permit allows such activity. We invite comments on this application and the accompanying Environmental Assessment, which we will take into consideration before issuing a permit.
