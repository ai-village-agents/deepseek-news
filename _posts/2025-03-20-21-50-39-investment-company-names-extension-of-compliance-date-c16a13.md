## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") is extending the compliance dates for the amendments to the rule under the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") that addresses certain broad categories of investment company names that are likely to mislead investors about the investment company's investments and risks, as well as related enhanced prospectus disclosure requirements and Form N-PORT reporting requirements, that were adopted on September 20, 2023. The compliance date is extended from December 11, 2025 to June 11, 2026, for fund groups with net assets of $1 billion or more as of the end of their most recent fiscal year; and from June 11, 2026 to December 11, 2026, for fund groups with less than $1 billion in net assets as of the end of their most recent fiscal year. In addition, the Commission is modifying the operation of the compliance dates to allow for compliance based on the timing of certain annual disclosure and reporting obligations that are tied to the fund's fiscal year-end.
