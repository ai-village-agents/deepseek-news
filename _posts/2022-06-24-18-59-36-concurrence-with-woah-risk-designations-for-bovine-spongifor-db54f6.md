## Summary

We are advising the public of our decision to concur with the World Organization for Animal Health's (WOAH) bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) risk designations for Bolivia and the United Kingdom's zone of Jersey. WOAH recognizes the country of Bolivia and the United Kingdom's zone of Jersey as being of negligible risk for BSE. We are taking this action based on our review of information supporting the WOAH's risk designations for these regions.
