## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for navigable waters within a half mile radius of the Donald Legg Memorial Bridge. The safety zone is needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards created by adding a center section of the bridge. Entry of vessels or persons into this zone is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port Sector Ohio Valley (COTP) or a designated representative. This temporary final rule reflects a change in the dates of the bridge construction than we previously announced in a prior temporary final rule.
