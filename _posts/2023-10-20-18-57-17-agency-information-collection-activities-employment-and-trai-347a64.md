## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice invites the general public and other public agencies to comment on this proposed information collection. This collection is a revision of a currently approved collection. This information collection includes the requirement for case management services to individuals participating in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Employment and Training (E&T) program as mandated by the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (FNA), as amended. The current information collection also includes four other provisions of the FNA and SNAP regulations that are being merged into other existing information collections. Those provisions include State agencies notifying individuals who have been determined ill-suited by an E&T provider for a particular E&T component; State agency notification to inform Able- bodied Adults without Dependents (ABAWD) about work requirements and the ABAWD time limit through a written notice and oral explanation; the requirement that State agencies inform SNAP households not otherwise exempt from the general work requirements in writing of available employment and training services at the time of recertification if these individuals are members of households that contain at least one adult, with no elderly or disabled individuals, and with no earned income at the their last recertification or required report; and the addition of four data elements to the FNS-583 reports (SNAP Employment and Training Program Activity Report).
