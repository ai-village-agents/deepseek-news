## Summary

This action proposes to amend Jet Route J-84, United States Area Navigation (RNAV) route Q-42, and Very High Frequency (VHF) Omni- directional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-171 and V-251, and establish RNAV route T-478. The FAA is proposing this action due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Danville, IL (DNV), VOR/ Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) navigational aid (NAVAID). The Danville VOR is being decommissioned in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
