## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the State of New York for purposes of implementing Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) in the New York portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island NY-NJ-CT nonattainment area (New York Metropolitan Area or NYMA) for the 2008 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) as it relates to major sources emitting oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>), control technique guidelines (CTG) for sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and non-CTG major sources of VOCs. In addition, the EPA is proposing to approve portions of the SIP revision submitted by New York to address the 2008 ozone NAAQS that certify that the State has satisfied the requirements for an enhanced vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Program, an emissions statement program, and a nonattainment new source review program. The EPA is also proposing to approve New York's RACT plan as it applies to the CTG for industrial cleaning solvents and to solvent metal cleaning processes. This action is being taken in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act.
