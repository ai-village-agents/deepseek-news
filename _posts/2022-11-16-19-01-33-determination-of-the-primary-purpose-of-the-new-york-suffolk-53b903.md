## Summary

USDA is providing public notice that the Secretary of Agriculture has determined that cost share payments made by the New York Suffolk County SIP are primarily for the purpose of conserving soil and water resources or protecting and restoring the environment. The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) was assigned technical and administrative responsibility for reviewing the New York Suffolk County SIP and for making appropriate recommendations for the Secretary's determination of primary purpose. The Secretary's determination permits recipients of cost share payments to exclude such payments from gross income to the extent allowed by the Internal Revenue Service.
