## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing an exemption in response to a request submitted by South Texas Project Nuclear Operating Company (STPNOC) on March 11, 2022, from meeting certain NRC regulatory requirements for one multipurpose canister (MPC), Serial Number 248 (MPC 248), in use at the South Texas Project Electric Generating Station, Units 1 and 2 (STPEGS). This exemption permits STPNOC to continue using MPC 248 to store spent fuel for the service life of the canister, including transferring the MPC to a HI- STORM FW overpack, without volumetric examination data from radiographic testing for a 1-inch section of the repaired weld seam joining the baseplate to the canister shell.
