## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, PHMSA invites public comments on its intent to request the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) approval of changes to existing information collections under OMB control numbers 2137-0627 (National Registry of Pipeline and LNG Operators), 2137-0635 (Pipeline Operators), 2137-0635 (Incident Reports for Natural Gas Pipeline Operators), 2137-0629 (Annual Report for Gas Distribution Operators), 2137-0522 (Annual Reports for Gas Pipeline Operators), 2137-0614 (Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Operator Annual Reports), and 2137-0596 (National Pipeline Mapping Program). The proposed information collection changes would provide data necessary to demonstrate an alternative approach to the implementation of Recommendation P-11-11 made by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and allow PHMSA to identify trends related to the blending of hydrogen gas and natural gas within gas pipelines from operator-submitted data.
