## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of N-(n-octyl)-2-pyrrolidone (CAS Reg. No. 2687-94-7) when used as an inert ingredient (solvent) in pesticide formulations containing prothioconazole as an active ingredient at a maximum concentration of 15% by weight. International Specialty Products submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting the exemption. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of N-(n-octyl)-2-pyrrolidone, when used in accordance with the terms of the exemption.
