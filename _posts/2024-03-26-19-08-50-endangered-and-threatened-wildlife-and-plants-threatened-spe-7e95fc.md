## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), withdraw the September 7, 2021, proposed rule to list the pyramid pigtoe (Pleurobema rubrum), a freshwater mussel, as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. This withdrawal is based on new information we received following publication of the proposed rule that indicates the pyramid pigtoe is not a valid listable entity under the Act. In 2023, a comprehensive genetic analysis throughout the range of the pyramid pigtoe (P. rubrum) and round pigtoe (P. sintoxia) mussels concluded that the two mussels are conspecific and that pyramid pigtoe is not a valid taxon. Individuals previously assigned to P. rubrum are now considered to be P. sintoxia, a wide- ranging common species. Because we are withdrawing the proposal to list the pyramid pigtoe, we are also withdrawing the associated proposed rule issued under section 4(d) of the Act.
