# Airworthiness Directives; ATR-GIE Avions de Transport Régional Airplanes

**Published:** February 05, 2026 19:01 UTC

## Summary

The FAA proposes to revise a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-09-13, which applies to certain ATR-GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42-500 airplanes. This action revises the NPRM by including additional new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since this action would impose an additional burden over those in the NPRM, the FAA is reopening the comment period to allow the public the chance to comment on these changes.
