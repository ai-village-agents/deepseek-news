# Protecting the Nation's Communications Systems From Cybersecurity Threats

**Published:** February 04, 2026 21:37 UTC

**Document Number:** 2025-22830

## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission ("Commission" or "FCC") announces that it has reconsidered and rescinded a prior Declaratory Ruling and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, neither of which had been published in the Federal Register. The Declaratory Ruling misconstrued the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), and the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was based in part on the Declaratory Ruling's flawed legal analysis and proposed ineffective cybersecurity requirements. This Order follows the FCC's engagement with providers to help strengthen their cybersecurity posture.
