## Summary

This final rule updates the National Bridge Inspection Standards (NBIS) for highway bridges. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) required the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to update the NBIS. Through this final rule, FHWA updates the NBIS to address MAP-21 requirements, incorporate technological advancements including the use of unmanned aircraft systems, and addresses ambiguities identified since the last update to the regulation in 2009. FHWA also is repealing two outdated regulations: the Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program and the Discretionary Bridge Candidate Rating Factor.
