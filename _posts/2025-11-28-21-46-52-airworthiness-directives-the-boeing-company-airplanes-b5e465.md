## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-15- 06, which applied to all The Boeing Company Model 777-200, -200LR, - 300, -300ER, and 777F series airplanes. AD 2022-15-06 required disconnecting certain connectors and capping and stowing the wires that had been attached to the affected transorb modules. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-15-06, the agency has determined additional connectors are affected. Also, a replacement has been developed to address the unsafe condition, which would terminate the existing actions. This AD continues to require the actions specified in AD 2022-15-06 and requires those actions for additional connectors. This AD also requires determining if affected transorb modules are installed, replacing or testing affected transorb modules, and applicable on-condition actions. This AD also prohibits the installation of affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
