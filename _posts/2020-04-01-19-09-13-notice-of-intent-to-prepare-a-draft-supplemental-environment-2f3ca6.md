# Notice of Intent To Prepare a Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report for the Sacramento Weir Component (Yolo County, California) of the American River Watershed Common Features Project, as Authorized Under the Water Resources Development Act of 2016

## Summary

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Sacramento District, and the Central Valley Flood Protection Board is preparing a Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report (Draft Supplemental EIS/EIR) for the Sacramento Weir widening component of the American River Watershed Common Features (ARCF) Levee Improvement Project authorized by the Water Resources Development Act of 2016. This Draft Supplemental EIS/EIR supplements the ARCF General Reevaluation Report (GRR) Final EIS/EIR. The Proposed Action includes constructing a 1,500-foot-long passive weir, with associated levee, roadway, rail bridge, and fish passage improvements adjacent to the existing Sacramento Weir at the junction of the Sacramento River and Sacramento Bypass. Conceptual components of the Proposed Action were analyzed in the ARCF GRR Final EIS/EIR but some elements of the Proposed Action (passive weir design and fish passage structure) were not analyzed in the ARCF GRR Final EIS/EIR because final designs are still in progress. USACE has now developed two alternative project designs in sufficient detail to analyze their environmental effects: A passive weir structure with a crest elevation at 26 feet on the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88) (the Proposed Action), and a passive weir structure with a crest elevation at 26 feet NAVD88, with stop logs to raise the crest elevation to 29.8 feet NAVD88 (the Higher Weir Elevation Alternative). Both design alternatives would reduce the flood risk in and around the cities of Sacramento and West Sacramento by conveying additional Sacramento River flow during flood events into the Sacramento and Yolo Bypasses.
