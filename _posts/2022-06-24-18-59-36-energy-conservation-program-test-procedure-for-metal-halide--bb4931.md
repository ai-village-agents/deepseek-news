## Summary

In this final rule, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is adopting amendments to its test procedure for metal halide lamp fixtures ("MHLFs") to incorporate by reference new relevant industry standards as well as update to latest versions of existing references; clarify the selection of reference lamps used for testing; specify the light output level at which to test dimming ballasts; revise definitions and reorganize the content of the test procedure for better readability and clarity; and revise the standby mode test method for MHLFs.
