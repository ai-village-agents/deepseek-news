## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a revision to the Arizona State Implementation Plan (SIP). This revision concerns emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) from the copper smelter in Miami, Arizona. We are approving the rescission of two Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) Arizona Administrative Code (A.A.C.) provisions from the Arizona SIP that are no longer needed to regulate this emission source under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the "Act").
