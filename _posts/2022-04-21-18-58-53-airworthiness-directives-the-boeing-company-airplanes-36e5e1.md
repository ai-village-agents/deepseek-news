## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 757-200, -200CB, and -300 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report indicating the passenger service units (PSUs) and life vest panels became separated from their attachments during several survivable accident sequences. This AD requires installing lanyard assemblies on the PSUs, and, for certain airplanes, on the life vest panels and video panels as applicable. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
