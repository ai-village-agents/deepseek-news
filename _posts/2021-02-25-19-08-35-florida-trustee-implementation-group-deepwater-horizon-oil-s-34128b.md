## Summary

In accordance with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA); the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA); the Final Programmatic Damage Assessment Restoration Plan and Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (Final PDARP/PEIS) and Record of Decision; and the Consent Decree, the Federal and State natural resource trustee agencies for the Florida Trustee Implementation Group (FL TIG) have prepared the Florida Trustee Implementation Group Draft Restoration Plan 2 and Environmental Assessment: Habitat Projects on Federally Managed Lands; Sea Turtles; Marine Mammals; Birds; and Provide and Enhance Recreational Opportunities (Draft RP/EA). In the Draft RP/EA, the FL TIG proposes projects to help restore injured habitats, sea turtles, marine mammals, birds, and to compensate for lost recreational use in the Florida Restoration Area as a result of the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill. The approximate cost to implement the FL TIG's proposed action (19 preferred alternatives) is $62,200,000. We invite public comments on the Draft RP/EA.
