## Summary

The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (NDAA) adds certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) automatically to the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) beginning January 1 of the year following specific triggering events. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is proposing to make conforming edits to the TRI regulation to explicitly include PFAS that are added to the TRI chemical list automatically pursuant to the NDAA in the regulation's definition of "toxic chemical." This edit confirms that the TRI supplier notification provision requires covered suppliers to notify customers receiving a mixture or other trade name product containing a TRI-listed chemical with the first shipment of each calendar year, with such a requirement beginning on January 1 of the applicable year; thus, supplier notifications are required as of January 1 for any NDAA-added PFAS.
