## Summary

This action establishes Area Navigation (RNAV) Routes Q-162 and Q-166 in the southwest United States. The new RNAV routes provide alternative routing for air traffic travelling between southwest Arizona and western Texas in response to severe weather events during the spring and summer months. Additionally, the new RNAV routes expand the availability of RNAV routing in support of transitioning the National Airspace System (NAS) from a ground-based to a satellite-based system for navigation.
