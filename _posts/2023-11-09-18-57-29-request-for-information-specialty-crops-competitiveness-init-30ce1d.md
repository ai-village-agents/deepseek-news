## Summary

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is seeking input from stakeholders across the specialty crops industry on how USDA may better administratively support the industry in remaining competitive in domestic and international marketplaces, as part of USDA's Specialty Crops Competitiveness Initiative. This input will strengthen USDA's partnership with the specialty crops industry, an agricultural sector that has faced significant challenges due to recent natural disasters, pandemic-related market disruptions, and other factors. USDA requests input on how to further support the industry's domestic marketing and consumption, to further support the industry's competitiveness internationally, to further support research that will serve the industry, to increase producers' awareness of and access to relevant USDA programs, to enhance USDA programs that serve the specialty crops industry, to aid the evaluation of existing programs, and to understand current and future challenges faced by the industry. USDA is asking for comments on interactions with USDA programs. All comments will be aggregated, summarized, and shared with USDA Leadership.
