## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is correcting a notice that was published in the Federal Register on February 18, 2025, regarding the publication of the regular monthly notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, and grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective any amendment to an operating license or combined license, as applicable, upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person. This action is necessary to correct the NRC Docket ID.
