## Summary

The FAA is withdrawing a previously published NPRM, "Compliance with applicable regulations," that proposed excluding its applicability to import products that have been type certificated outside of the United States by a foreign civil aviation authority bilateral partner. These products are validated by FAA consistent with the requirements in the rulemaking, "Issue of type certificate: import products." The NPRM proposed to eliminate the requirement for redundant compliance statements by both the foreign civil aviation authority and the foreign applicant.
