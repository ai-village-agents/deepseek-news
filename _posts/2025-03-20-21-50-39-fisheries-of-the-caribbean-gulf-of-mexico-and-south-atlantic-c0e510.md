## Summary

NMFS announces the 2025 recreational fishing season for golden tilefish in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the South Atlantic. Announcing the length of the recreational fishing season is the accountability measure (AM) for the recreational sector. NMFS estimates that recreational landings of golden tilefish will soon reach the recreational annual catch limit (ACL) for the 2025 fishing year. Accordingly, NMFS announces the closure date for the recreational harvest of golden tilefish in the South Atlantic EEZ to protect the golden tilefish resource.
