## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-13-11, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. AD 2022-13-11 requires revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) for airplanes equipped with affected flight control units (FCUs) and replacing any affected FCU with a serviceable FCU. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-13-11, the FAA has determined that it is necessary to expand the applicability of the AFM revision requirement to all Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes, including those equipped with serviceable FCUs. This proposed AD would continue to require certain actions in AD 2022-13-11, including replacing any affected FCU with a serviceable FCU, expand the requirement to revise the existing AFM for all airplanes, and prohibit the installation of affected parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
