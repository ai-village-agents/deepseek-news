## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model EC130B4 and EC130T2 helicopters. The FAA previously sent this AD as an emergency AD to all known U.S. owners and operators of these helicopters. This AD was prompted by a determination that the service life limit of the center shaft assembly needs to be corrected because a crack could initiate on the center shaft assembly. This AD requires replacing the center shaft assembly with a serviceable center shaft assembly (either a shaft with another part number (P/N) or the same P/N with lower hours time-in-service (TIS)). This AD also prohibits installing a center shaft assembly that is not a serviceable center shaft assembly on any helicopter. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
