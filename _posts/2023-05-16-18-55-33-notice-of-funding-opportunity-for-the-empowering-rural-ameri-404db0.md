## Summary

The Rural Utilities Service (RUS or the Agency), a Rural Development (RD) agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), is soliciting Letters of Interest (LOI) for applications under the Empowering Rural America (New ERA) Program. In addition, the Agency is announcing the eligibility requirements, application process and deadlines, and the criteria that will be used by RUS to assess New ERA Applications. The New ERA Program provides RUS with $9.7 billion in appropriated loan and grant funds under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. In keeping with the statutory authority for the program, RUS will utilize the New ERA funds to assist Eligible Entities to achieve the greatest reduction in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions while advancing the long-term resiliency, reliability, and affordability of rural electric systems. All Eligible Entities are responsible for any expenses incurred in developing their LOIs and New ERA Applications.
