This workshop will include discussions of designs of postapproval pregnancy safety studies for drug and biological products regulated by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and experiences with implementing these studies. The workshop also will include discussion of considerations for further development of a framework that describes how data from different types of postapproval pregnancy safety studies might optimally be used when it has been determined that this data should be collected.
