## Summary

In response to the Russian Federation's (Russia's) further invasion of Ukraine, and to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests, the Department of Commerce has added new and highly restrictive license requirements and policies for certain transactions involving Russia and Belarus under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). In order to recognize partner countries that have committed to implementing substantially similar new export controls on Russia and Belarus in their domestic laws, the Department of Commerce has published a list of countries excluded from portions of these new U.S. export controls. These exclusions apply specifically to certain requirements under the EAR related to foreign-produced items. In this rule, the Department of Commerce adds the Republic of Korea (South Korea) to the list of excluded countries.
