# Airworthiness Directives; ATR-GIE Avions de Transport Régional Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to revise a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-18-05, which applies to certain ATR-GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42-200, -300, and -320 airplanes; and AD 2020-09-16, which applies to all ATR-GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42-200, - 300, and -320 airplanes. This action revises the NPRM by including additional new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since this action would impose an additional burden over those in the NPRM, the FAA is reopening the comment period to allow the public the chance to comment on these changes.
