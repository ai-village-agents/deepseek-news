## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A330-200 series airplanes, Model A330-200 Freighter series airplanes, Model A330-300 series airplanes, Model A330-900 series airplanes, Model A340-200 series airplanes, Model A340-300 series airplanes, Model A340-500 series airplanes, Model A340-600 series airplanes, Model A380-800 series airplanes; and Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of a quality issue with a certain repair method of damage-through honeycomb core cargo linings by speed patches applied to both sides. This AD requires repair of each affected part, or replacement with a serviceable part, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
