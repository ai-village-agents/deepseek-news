## Summary

This document denies petitions from Volkswagen Group of America (Volkswagen) and BMW of North America, LLC (BMW) (collectively, Petitioners) for temporary exemptions from certain requirements of FMVSS No. 108 to allow installation of adaptive driving beam (ADB) headlighting systems. Both manufacturers requested exemptions on the basis that an exemption would facilitate the development or field evaluation of a new motor vehicle safety feature providing a safety level at least equal to that of the standard. NHTSA has determined that, in light of the publication today of a final rule amending FMVSS No. 108 to allow ADB systems, there is no need to grant the requested exemptions because the standard now allows the deployment of such systems. Accordingly, the petitions are denied.
