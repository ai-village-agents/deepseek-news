This notice announces the public availability of the draft ATMP and draft EA for comment and the date of the public meeting for the Park in accordance with National Parks Air Tour Management Act of 2000 and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969. The purpose of the public meeting is to review the draft ATMP with the public.

In accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, the FAA and the NPS are also seeking public comment on the potential of the draft ATMP to cause adverse effects to historic properties.
