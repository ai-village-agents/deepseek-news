## Summary

On February 8, 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") published a request for information regarding energy conservation standards for fans and blowers. In this NODA, DOE is publishing preliminary inputs and methodology for its technology, screening, engineering, shipments, markups, life cycle cost, and energy use analysis for air circulating fans. Air circulating fans are a subcategory of fans; however, air circulating fans were not included in the Appliance Standards and Rulemaking Federal Advisory ("ASRAC") negotiations undertaken in 2015 (see Docket No. EERE-2013-BT-STD-0006). The purpose of this NODA is to provide stakeholders with the opportunity to review and provide comment on DOE's preliminary technical and economic evaluation of air circulating fans, prior to DOE's publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking for all fans and blowers. The analysis presented in this NODA is consistent with the air circulating fans scope and definitions that DOE proposed in the July 25, 2022, test procedure notice of proposed rulemaking ("NOPR") for fans and blowers ("July 2022 TP NOPR"). DOE requests comments, data, and information regarding its analysis.
