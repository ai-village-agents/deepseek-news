## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all DG Aviation GmbH (type certificate previously held by DG Flugzeugbau GmbH) Model DG-1000T gliders. This AD was prompted by reports of propeller separation. This AD requires revising the glider flight manual and installing "Motor INOP" placards to prohibit operation with the powerplant. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
