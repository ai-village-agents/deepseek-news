## Summary

On December 12, 2022, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued an interim final rule, Removal of Obsolete Procedures and Requirements Related to F, J, and M Nonimmigrants, that inadvertently contained inaccurate amendatory instructions so that the revisions in the 2022 rule could not be made to the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). This document corrects the CFR.
