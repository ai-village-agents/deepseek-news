## Summary

NMFS is adjusting the Harpoon category bluefin tuna (BFT) daily retention limit from the default of no more than 10 large medium and giant BFT (i.e., measuring 73 inches (185 cm) or greater curved fork length (CFL)), combined, to 5 large medium and giant BFT, combined, per vessel per day/trip. This action maintains the incidental daily catch limit of two large medium BFT (measuring 73 inches to less than 81 inches (206 cm)) per vessel per day/trip. This action applies to Atlantic Tunas Harpoon category permitted vessels and will be effective for the remainder of the 2023 Harpoon category fishing season, which ends November 15, 2023.
