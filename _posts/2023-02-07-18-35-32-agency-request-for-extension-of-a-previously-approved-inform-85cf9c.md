## Summary

The Department of Transportation (DOT) invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to extend an information collection. The collection involves anyone who wants to provide air transportation service. The information collected will be used to determine if the applicant meets the requirements to perform the proposed service and is necessary because of title 49 of the United States Code. We are required to publish this notice in the Federal Register by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
