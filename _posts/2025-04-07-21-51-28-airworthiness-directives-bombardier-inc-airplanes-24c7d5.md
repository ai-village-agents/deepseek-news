## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-2B16 (604 Variant) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports that the flap system on-board recorder (FSOBR) interfaces with the flap control unit signals and may result in the flap control unit monitors tripping, causing Flap Fail messages and possibly an uncommanded flap movement. This proposed AD would require the disconnection of the FSOBR and prohibit future installation of this system. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
