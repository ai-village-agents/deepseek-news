## Summary

This document gives notice of final approval of the Oregon State occupational safety and health plan (State Plan) over temporary labor camps under section 18(e) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act). As a result of this affirmative 18(e) determination, the Federal standard and enforcement authority as derived from the OSH Act will no longer apply to temporary labor camps in Oregon. This notification does not affect or disturb any other provisions or standards enforced by the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division at temporary labor camps in Oregon pursuant to an authority other than the OSH Act. This notification also does not affect or disturb the previous grant of final approval in 2005 as to all other issues covered by the Oregon State Plan.
