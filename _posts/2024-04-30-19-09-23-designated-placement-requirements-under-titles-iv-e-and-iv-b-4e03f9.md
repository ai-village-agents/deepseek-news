## Summary

This rule finalizes requirements under titles IV-E and IV-B for children in foster care who are LGBTQI+ (an umbrella term used in this regulation). The proposed rule was published on September 28, 2023. Federal law requires that state and tribal title IV-E and IV-B agencies ("agencies") ensure that each child in foster care receives "safe and proper" care and has a case plan that addresses the specific needs of the child while in foster care to support their health and wellbeing. To meet these and other related statutory requirements, this final rule requires agencies to ensure that placements for all children are free from harassment, mistreatment, and abuse. The final rule requires that title IV-E and IV-B agencies ensure a Designated Placement is available for all children who identify as LGBTQI+ and specifies the Designated Placement requirements.
