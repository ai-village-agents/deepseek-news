## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Department of Energy and Environment (DOEE, the "Department") on behalf of the District of Columbia (DC, the "District"). The revisions pertain to creating a synthetic minor permit program and resolving the regulatory differences between the District's current regulations and those regulations approved previously in Chapters 1 and 2 of the Air Quality Regulations. The intended effect of this action is to enable DC to create federally enforceable synthetic minor permit conditions for sources of criteria pollutants pursuant to section 110 of the Clean Air Act (CAA, the "Act"). This action is being taken under the CAA.
