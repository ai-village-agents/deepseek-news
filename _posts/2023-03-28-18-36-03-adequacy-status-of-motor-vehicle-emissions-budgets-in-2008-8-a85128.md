## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is notifying the public that we have found motor vehicle emissions budgets ("budgets") for the Coachella Valley adequate for transportation conformity purposes. Specifically, our finding relates to budgets in the "Request to Reclassify Coachella Valley for the 2008 8-hour Ozone Standard and the Updated Motor Vehicle Emission Budgets" ("Coachella Valley Extreme RFP Plan"), submitted to the EPA for inclusion in the California state implementation plan (SIP) by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) on December 7, 2022. Upon the effective date of this notice of adequacy, the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) and the U.S. Department of Transportation must use these budgets in future transportation conformity analyses.
