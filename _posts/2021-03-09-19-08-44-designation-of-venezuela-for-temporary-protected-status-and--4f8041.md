## Summary

Through this notice, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announces that the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) is designating Venezuela for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 18 months, effective March 9, 2021, through September 9, 2022. This notice also provides procedures for individuals who believe they are eligible for TPS under the designation of Venezuela to apply. This notice also provides information about Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) for eligible Venezuelan nationals (and persons without nationality who last habitually resided in Venezuela), and provides information on how eligible individuals may apply for DED-related EADs with USCIS, based on the January 19, 2021 memorandum from former President Donald Trump directing the Secretary to take appropriate measures for the implementation of DED for Venezuelan nationals for 18 months, through July 20, 2022 (see 86 FR 6845, dated January 25, 2021). Note: Individuals who apply for and receive TPS and who are also covered by DED do not need to apply for employment authorization under both programs. Individuals who apply for an EAD pursuant to their TPS application will receive an EAD with an expiration date of September 9, 2022, that is eligible for renewal if the Secretary extends TPS for Venezuela after September 9, 2022, after determining that Venezuela continues to meet the conditions supporting its designation for TPS. Individuals who apply for an EAD pursuant to DED will receive an EAD with an expiration date of July 20, 2022. If the President does not direct an extension of the DED authorization, DED, and associated employment authorization, will end on July 20, 2022. USCIS encourages individuals who believe they are eligible for TPS to file for the benefit during the initial registration period announced in this Notice, even if they are also covered by DED, in case they cannot qualify for TPS late initial filing under 8 CFR 244.2(f)(2) after DED has expired.
