## Summary

This document announces that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is modifying the collections process for deferred payments of internal revenue taxes owed on consumption entries of distilled spirits, wines, and beer imported into the United States (other than in bulk containers). The primary modification announced in this notice is the harmonization of the determination of the due date for deferred tax payments with the entry summary date. Another modification is the consolidation of all deferred tax entry bills from all ports of entry for one semi-monthly period into consolidated bill(s) viewable in the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE). CBP is further facilitating deferred tax payments by removing current policy restrictions on the filing of entries with deferred taxes and eliminating the now unnecessary Semi-Monthly Excise Tax Form (Greater than 50) for importers who pay deferred taxes through Pay.gov. Lastly, CBP is adding a new payment method for deferred taxes in ACE while also eliminating a current, but lesser-used payment method available through Fedwire.
