## Summary

This action amends Jet Route J-8 and VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airway V-140, and establishes Area Navigation (RNAV) route T-422 in the vicinity of Kingfisher, OK. The Air Traffic Service (ATS) route modifications are necessary due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Kingfisher, OK, VOR/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) navigational aid (NAVAID) which provides navigational guidance for portions of J-8 and V-140. The VOR portion of the VORTAC is being decommissioned as part of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
