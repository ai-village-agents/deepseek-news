## Summary

NMFS announces the availability of a draft environmental assessment (EA) evaluating the potential effects of constructing a rock revetment along Garapan Fishing Base, Saipan, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). Garapan Fishing Base supports sustainable fishing infrastructure including a boat ramp, trailer parking, and other community activities such as shore fishing, community markets and recreation. Stabilizing the shoreline would protect public land and infrastructure and reduce erosion resulting in improved water quality in Saipan Lagoon along shore.
