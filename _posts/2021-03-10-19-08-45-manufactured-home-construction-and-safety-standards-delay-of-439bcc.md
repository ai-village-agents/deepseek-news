## Summary

The Department of Housing and Urban Development is delaying the effective date of its final rule published on January 12, 2021, that amends the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards (the Construction and Safety Standards) that were based upon the third group of recommendations made to HUD by the Manufactured Housing Consensus Committee (MHCC), as modified by HUD. The March 15, 2021, effective date does not provide adequate time for affected manufacturers and stakeholders to implement the new requirements. By extending the effective date from March 15, 2021, to July 12, 2021, manufacturers and other stakeholders will have sufficient time to implement the new or amended requirements.
