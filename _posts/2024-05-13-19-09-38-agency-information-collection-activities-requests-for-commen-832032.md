## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on March 14, 2024. The collection involves maintaining and recording "the status of life-limited parts of each airframe, engine, propeller, rotor, and appliance. The information to be collected is necessary for verifying the time-life of life-limited parts and is used to ensure parts that have reached their life-limit are not installed on an aircraft, or are removed from an aircraft and properly dispositioned.
