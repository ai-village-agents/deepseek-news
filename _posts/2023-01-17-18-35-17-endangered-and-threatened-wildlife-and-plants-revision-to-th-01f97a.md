## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are extending the comment period on our November 17, 2022, proposed rule to revise the rule for the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) promulgated under section 4(d) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (ESA). We are extending the comment period for 60 days to give all interested parties an additional opportunity to comment. Comments previously submitted need not be resubmitted as they are already incorporated into the public record and will be fully considered in the proposed rule.
