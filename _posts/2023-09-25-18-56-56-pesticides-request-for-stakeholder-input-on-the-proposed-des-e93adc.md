## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the availability of a Request for Information (RFI) that seeks public comment on a proposed design for the new grant program related to the Health Care Provider (HCP) Training Program, a cooperative agreement to help medical professionals better prevent, recognize, treat, and manage pesticide-related illness. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2022 (referred to as PRIA 5) included set-asides of up to $2.5 million for fiscal years 2023-2027 to fund the HCP Training Program. PRIA 5 also requires EPA to seek input from persons who conduct farmworker education and training, or technical assistance and training of healthcare providers, to inform the design of the grant program. EPA has previously solicited input on the HCP Training Program design through its Federal advisory committees, which include representatives of these stakeholders. The purpose of this RFI is to solicit additional stakeholder feedback from a broad array of individuals and organizations with knowledge and expertise related to the goals of the HCP Training Program. Additional public input, including environmental justice perspectives, will help the Agency refine the HCP Training Program and design a grant program to more effectively support populations that have historically been at high risk from pesticide-related illness.
