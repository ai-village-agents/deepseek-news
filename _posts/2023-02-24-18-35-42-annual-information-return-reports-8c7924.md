## Summary

This document contains final forms and instructions revisions for the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan and Form 5500-SF Short Form Annual Return/Report of Small Employee Benefit Plan effective for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2023. The forms and instructions revisions relate to statutory amendments to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code (Code) enacted as part of the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act of 2019 (SECURE Act) for multiple-employer plans and groups of plans, as well as changes intended to improve reporting of certain plan financial information regarding audits and plan expenses and enhance the reporting of certain tax qualification and other compliance information by retirement plans. There are also some minor changes that further improve defined benefit plan reporting by building on changes made to the forms for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2022. The remaining changes are technical changes that are part of the annual rollover of the Form 5500 and Form 5500-SF forms and instructions. The revisions being finalized in this document affect employee pension and welfare benefit plans, plan sponsors, administrators, and service providers to plans subject to annual reporting requirements under ERISA and the Code.
