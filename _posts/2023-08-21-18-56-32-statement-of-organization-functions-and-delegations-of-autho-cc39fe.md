# Statement of Organization, Functions, and Delegations of Authority

**Published:** February 05, 2026 18:56 UTC

## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is correcting a notice entitled "Statement of Organization, Functions, and Delegations of Authority" that appeared in the Federal Register of August 14, 2023. The document announced amendments to the organization structure for FDA, Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), Office of Strategic Partnerships and Technology Innovation (OST). Although HHS approved these amendments on June 27, 2023, the Notice inadvertently omitted to include the following language: "FDA will not implement the new organizational structure until after the necessary requirements are completed." This document corrects that error.
