## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its regulations to require NRC and Agreement State licensees to provide advance notification to participating federally recognized Tribal governments regarding shipments of category 1 quantities of radioactive material that pass within or across their reservation boundaries. This proposed rule would resolve a petition for rulemaking (PRM-37-2) requesting changes to the regulations to include advance Tribal notification requirements similar to existing State notification requirements. The NRC will hold a public meeting during the public comment period to promote full understanding of this proposed rule and facilitate public comments.
