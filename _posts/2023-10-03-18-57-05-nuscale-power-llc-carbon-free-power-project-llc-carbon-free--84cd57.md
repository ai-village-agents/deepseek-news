## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is providing notice that an uncontested hearing will be held on the Carbon Free Power Project (CFPP), LLC limited work authorization (LWA) application that proposes certain early construction activities at the CFPP site located in the Idaho National Laboratory complex, near Idaho Falls, Idaho, at a time and place to be set in the future by the Commission or by a designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board; a further notice of hearing, providing such information, will be issued in the future. This notice also provides the public an opportunity to request a hearing and petition for leave to intervene with respect to that application. The NRC staff is currently conducting a detailed technical review of the LWA application. If the NRC issues a LWA, the applicant, CFPP, would be authorized to conduct certain early construction activities at its proposed small modular reactor site in accordance with the provisions of the limited work authorization. Because the LWA application contains Sensitive Unclassified Non-Safeguards Information (SUNSI), this notice includes an order imposing procedures to obtain access to SUNSI for contention preparation.
