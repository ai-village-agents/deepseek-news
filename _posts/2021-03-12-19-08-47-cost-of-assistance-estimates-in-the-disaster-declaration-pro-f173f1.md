## Summary

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is further extending the public comment period for its proposed rule published December 14, 2020, and will hold two additional public meetings remotely via web conference to solicit feedback on the proposed rule. The rule proposed to substantively revise the "estimated cost of the assistance" disaster declaration factor that FEMA uses to review a Governor's request for a major disaster under the Public Assistance Program.
