## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of Government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Healthcare Outbreak Prevention and Response Curriculum for Public Health Departments. This data collection will allow CDC to evaluate whether the CDC-developed trainings are reaching the intended audience and achieving the intended goal of strengthening public health workforce capacity to prevent and respond to Healthcare-Associated Infections and Antibiotic Resistance (HAI/AR) outbreaks.
