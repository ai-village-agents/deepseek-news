## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-07-08 for Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (Airbus Helicopters) Model MBB- BK 117 D-2 helicopters. AD 2017-07-08 required repetitively inspecting each engine mount elastomeric bushing (elastomeric bushing). Since the FAA issued AD 2017-07-08, Airbus Helicopters has designed an improved engine mount metal bushing (metal bushing). This new AD retains the inspection requirements of AD 2017-07-08 and requires replacing each affected engine mount bushing with an improved engine mount bushing, while also requiring repetitive inspections of the improved engine mount bushing. This AD also prohibits installing an elastomeric bushing on any helicopter. The actions of this AD are intended to address an unsafe condition on these products.
