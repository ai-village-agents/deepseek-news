## Summary

The Department of Defense (DoD or Department) is amending its Privacy Program regulation to add four routine uses to its list of blanket routine uses. These new blanket routine uses will support necessary information sharing from DoD Privacy Act systems of records in the event of a data breach, and support sharing with other government agencies for counterterrorism purposes. This rule is being published as a direct final rule as the Department does not expect to receive any adverse comments. If such comments are received, this direct final rule will be withdrawn and a proposed rule for comments will be published.
