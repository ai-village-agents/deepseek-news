## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission or Agency) proposes to add a new system of records, FCC/WCB-5, USAC Customer Relationship Management (CRM), subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. This action is necessary to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act to publish in the Federal Register notice of the existence and character of records maintained by the Agency. The Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), under the direction of the Commission and, by delegation, of the Commission's Wireline Competition Bureau (WCB), administers the Universal Service Fund (USF) programs and certain programs funded by Congressional appropriations ("appropriated programs"). This system of records contains information about individuals who are customers, participants, and stakeholders of the programs who submit complaints and requests for assistance to USAC to address issues with their program participation.
