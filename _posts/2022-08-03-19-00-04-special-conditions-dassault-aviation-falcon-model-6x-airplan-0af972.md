## Summary

These special conditions are issued for the Dassault Aviation (Dassault) Model Falcon 6X Airplane. This airplane will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport category airplanes. This design feature is a high speed protection system that limits nose-down pilot authority at speeds above V<INF>C</INF>/ M<INF>C</INF>. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
