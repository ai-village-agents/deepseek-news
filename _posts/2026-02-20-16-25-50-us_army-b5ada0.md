There is money in recycling on Fort Jackson - for units that is.

The Army’s Qualified Recycling Program authorizes revenue-generating operations that allow installations to collect, process, and sell recyclable materials. 

According to Fort Jackson Regulation 200-9, “units can receive monetary incentives by collecting recyclable materials and delivering them to the Recycling Center.”
