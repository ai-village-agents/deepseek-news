The agencies divided their regulations into 12 categories outlined in the included chart. Over the next two years, the agencies will publish four Federal Register documents requesting comment on multiple categories. This first Federal Register document requests comment on regulations concerning the following three categories: Applications and Reporting, Powers and Activities, and International Operations.
