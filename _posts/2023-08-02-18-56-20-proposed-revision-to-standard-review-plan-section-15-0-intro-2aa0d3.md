The NRC seeks comments on the proposed draft section revision of the Standard Review Plan (SRP), concerning the evaluation of the safety of a nuclear power plant that requires analyses of the plant's responses to postulated equipment failures or malfunctions. Such analyses help to determine the limiting conditions for operation, limiting safety system settings, and design specifications for components and systems to protect public health and safety.
