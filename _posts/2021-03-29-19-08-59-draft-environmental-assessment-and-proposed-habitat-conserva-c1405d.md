## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) have received an application from Scout Clean Energy's Bitter Ridge Wind Farm, LLC (applicant), for an incidental take permit (ITP) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), for its Bitter Ridge Wind Farm (project). The applicant requests the ITP, which would be for a 35-year period, for the take of the federally listed endangered Indiana bat and threatened northern long-eared bat incidental to the otherwise lawful activities associated with the Bitter Ridge Wind Farm. The applicant proposes a conservation program to minimize and mitigate for the unavoidable incidental take as described in their Habitat Conservation Plan. The Service requests public comment on the application, which includes the applicant's proposed HCP, and the Service's draft environmental assessment, prepared pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The Service provides this notice to seek comments from the public and Federal, Tribal, State and local governments.
