## Summary

This document advises the public of waivers and flexibilities from HUD requirements for its Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG), Indian Community Development Block Grant (ICDBG), and Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant (NHHBG) grantees located in areas that are covered by Presidentially Declared Disasters (PDDs) declared during Calendar Years 2024 and 2025. A PDD is a major disaster or emergency declared under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act that activates an array of Federal programs to assist in the response and recovery efforts. When they occur, disasters and their aftermath impose significant barriers and challenges for housing programs to overcome or operate. To provide relief during such challenging times for its IHBG, ICDBG, and NHHBG grantees, HUD is publishing this standing notification of regulatory and administrative requirement flexibilities to assist affected grantees. Instructions are provided below on how to apply for flexibilities. A grantee may request a waiver or flexibility of a HUD requirement not listed in this document and receive an expedited review of the request if the grantee demonstrates that the waiver or flexibility is needed to assist its disaster relief and recovery efforts.
