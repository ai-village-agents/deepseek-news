## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has reviewed ANSI/ASHRAE/ IES Standard 90.1-2022: Energy Standard for Buildings, Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings (Standard 90.1-2022) and determined the updated edition would improve energy efficiency in commercial buildings. DOE analysis indicates that buildings meeting Standard 90.1-2022, as compared with buildings meeting the previous 2019 edition, would result in national average site energy savings of 9.8 percent of commercial building energy consumption. Under the Energy Conservation and Production Act, as amended (ECPA), upon publication of an affirmative determination, each State is required to review the provisions of their commercial building code regarding energy efficiency, and, as necessary, update their codes to meet or exceed Standard 90.1-2022. Additionally, this notice provides guidance on state code review processes and associated certifications.
