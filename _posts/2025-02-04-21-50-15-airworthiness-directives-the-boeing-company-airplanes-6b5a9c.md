## Summary

The FAA is withdrawing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-08-04, which applies to certain The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. The NPRM was prompted by reports of a loss of water pressure during flight and water leaks that affected multiple pieces of electronic equipment, and by the discovery that some clamshell couplings did not have the required safety strap. The NPRM would have required inspecting all door 1 and door 3 lavatory and galley potable water systems for missing or incorrectly installed clamshell couplings, inspecting all clamshell couplings for the presence and correct installation of safety straps at door 1 and door 3 lavatories and galleys with a potable water system, and performing applicable on- condition actions. The NPRM would have also prohibited the installation of affected parts at inspection locations and removed Model 787-10 airplanes from the applicability. Since issuance of the NPRM, the FAA has determined that the identified service information may not adequately address the unsafe condition on one of the galleys, and Model 787-10 airplanes should be included in the applicability. Accordingly, the NPRM is withdrawn.
