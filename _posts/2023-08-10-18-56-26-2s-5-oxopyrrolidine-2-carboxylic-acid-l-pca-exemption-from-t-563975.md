## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of (2S)-5-Oxopyrrolidine-2-carboxylic Acid (L-PCA) in or on all food commodities when used as a plant growth regulator in accordance with label directions and good agricultural practices. Exponent, on behalf of Verdesian Life Sciences U.S., LLC, submitted a petition, pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), asking the EPA to amend its regulations to establish an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of the pesticide, when used as a plant growth regulator on agricultural crops, turf and ornamental plants. Instead, EPA is establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues L-PCA in or on all food commodities when applied in buffered end-use products and used in accordance with label directions and good agricultural practices. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of L-PCA when used in accordance with this exemption.
