## Summary

The FDIC is adopting a final rule that codifies the Interagency Statement Clarifying the Role of Supervisory Guidance, issued by the FDIC, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Treasury (OCC), National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), and Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) (collectively, the agencies) on September 11, 2018 (2018 Statement). By codifying the 2018 Statement, with amendments, the final rule confirms that the FDIC will continue to follow and respect the limits of administrative law in carrying out its supervisory responsibilities. The 2018 Statement reiterated well- established law by stating that, unlike a law or regulation, supervisory guidance does not have the force and effect of law. As such, supervisory guidance does not create binding legal obligations for the public. Because it is incorporated into the final rule, the 2018 Statement, as amended, is binding on the FDIC. The final rule adopts the rule as proposed without substantive changes.
