## Summary

The National Institute of Food and Agriculture, as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, invites the general public to take this opportunity to comment on the "Generic Clearance for the Collection of Qualitative Feedback on Agency Service Delivery" for approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). This collection was developed to create a vehicle for obtaining stakeholder feedback and was previously approved in 2017. The collection approval expired on June 30, 2020. This notice announces our intent to revise and re-submit this collection to Office of Management and Budget for approval and solicits comments on specific aspects for the proposed information collection.
