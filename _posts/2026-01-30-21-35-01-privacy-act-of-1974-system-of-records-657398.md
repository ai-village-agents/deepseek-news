## Summary

CIGIE proposes to modify two systems of records that are subject to the Privacy Act of 1974. CIGIE established these systems of records pursuant to Public Law 116-136, in furtherance of the statutory mandate of CIGIE's Pandemic Response Accountability Committee (PRAC) to promote transparency and conduct and support oversight of covered funds and the Coronavirus response, as defined in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), Public Law 116-136; 134 Stat. 533, Section 15010, as amended. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, Public Law 116-260, 134 Stat. 1182, Division O, Title VIII, Section 801(b), and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117- 103, 136 STAT 307, Division E, Title VII, Section 750, further amended the definition of "covered funds" to clarify PRAC's authorities. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) extended the PRAC's jurisdiction to include all funds provided in the OBBB, amended Section 15010(a)(6) of the CARES Act to include the OBBB under the definition of "covered funds," and extended PRAC's sunset date to September 30, 2034. An Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to title II of H. Con. Res. 14, Public Law 119-21, Section 90102 (July 4, 2025)(OBBB). This modification of the two SORNs CIGIE established in furtherance of the PRAC's statutory mandate will bring both SORNs into alignment with the PRAC's jurisdiction, to include its expanded jurisdiction. CIGIE also proposes to modify the Routine Uses in these SORNs to comply with Executive Order (E.O.) 14249, Protecting America's Bank Account Against Fraud, Waste, and Abuse, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum M-25-32, Preventing Improper Payments and Protecting Privacy Through Do Not Pay. CIGIE proposes deleting the reference to "Officials of CIGIE" in the Routine Uses, as the Privacy Act permits disclosures to internal agency employees; therefore, such disclosures are not considered routine uses.
