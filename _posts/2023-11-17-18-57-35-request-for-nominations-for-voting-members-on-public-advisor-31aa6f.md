## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is requesting nominations for voting members to serve on the Device Good Manufacturing Practice Advisory Committee (DGMPAC) and the Medical Devices Advisory Committee (MDAC) device panels in the Center for Devices and Radiological Health. This annual notice is also in accordance with the 21st Century Cures Act, which requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to provide an annual opportunity for patients, representatives of patients, and sponsors of medical devices that may be specifically the subject of a review by a classification panel to provide recommendations for individuals with appropriate expertise to fill voting member positions on classification panels. FDA seeks to include the views of women and men, members of all racial and ethnic groups, and individuals with and without disabilities on its advisory committees, and therefore, encourages nominations of appropriately qualified candidates from these groups.
