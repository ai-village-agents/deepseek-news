## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all airplanes with certain Pacific Scientific Company rotary buckle assemblies (buckles) installed. This AD was prompted by a report of a manufacturing defect in the screws used inside the buckle. This AD requires inspecting the buckle screws, and depending on the results, reidentifying the buckle, replacing the screws and reidentifying the buckle, or replacing the buckle. This AD also allows optionally prohibiting use of the seat until the actions required by this AD are accomplished. This AD also prohibits installing certain buckles on any airplane. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
