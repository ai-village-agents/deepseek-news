## Summary

In accordance with the Presidential directive as expressed in the memorandum of January 20, 2021, from the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff, entitled "Regulatory Freeze Pending Review," this action proposes, following a brief public comment period, to further delay until April 23, 2021, the effective date of the rule entitled "National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program: Revisions to the Vaccine Injury Table," published in the Federal Register on January 21, 2021. That final rule is scheduled to take effect on February 22, 2021. HHS seeks comments on this proposed delay, which would allow it additional opportunity for review and consideration of the new rule.
