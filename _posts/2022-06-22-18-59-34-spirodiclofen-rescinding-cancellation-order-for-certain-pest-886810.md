## Summary

In the Federal Register of November 19, 2021, EPA amended the effective date of the cancellation for the two spirodiclofen registrations, EPA Registration Nos. 10163-382 and 10163-383, as requested by the registrant (Gowan), for the two registrations from December 31, 2021, until June 30, 2022. This notice announces that EPA is rescinding the cancellation order based on the submission of outstanding data that facilitated the risk assessments and registration review decision for spirodiclofen, as well as the registrant's commitment to implement label changes that adequately address the Agency's risk concerns. The registrant has submitted an amended label for the sole end-use product (EPA Registration No. 10163-383) that reflects the risk mitigation proposed by the Agency.
