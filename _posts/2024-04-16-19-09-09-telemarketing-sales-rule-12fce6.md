## Summary

The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC" or "Commission") proposes to amend the Telemarketing Sales Rule ("Rule") to extend its coverage to inbound telemarketing calls by consumers to technical support services--i.e., calls that consumers make in response to an advertisement through any medium or to a direct mail solicitation. The proposed amendment is necessary in light of the widespread deception and consumer injury caused by tech support scams. The amendment would provide the Commission with the ability to obtain stronger relief in cases involving tech support scams, including civil penalties and consumer redress.
