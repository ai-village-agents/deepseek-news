## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission is correcting a final rule that appeared in the Federal Register on September 20, 2022. The document modified partitioning, disaggregation, and leasing rules to provide specific incentives for small carriers and Tribal Nations, and entities in rural areas, to voluntarily participate in the Enhanced Competition Incentive Program (ECIP). The ECIP proceeding is in response to Congressional direction in the Making Opportunities for Broadband Investment and Limiting Excessive and Needless Obstacles to Wireless Act (MOBILE NOW Act) to consider steps to increase the diversity of spectrum access and the availability of advanced telecommunications services in rural areas. The ECIP will promote greater competition in the provision of wireless services, facilitate increased availability of advanced wireless services in rural areas, facilitate new opportunities for small carriers and Tribal Nations to increase access to spectrum, and bring more advanced wireless service including 5G to underserved communities.
