## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of various fragrance components listed in Unit II of this document when used as an inert ingredient in antimicrobial formulations applied to food-contact surfaces in public eating places, dairy-processing equipment, and food-processing equipment and utensils under 40 CFR 180.940(a) when the end-use concentration does not exceed 5 parts per million (ppm). Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), Innovative Reform Group, on behalf of The Clorox Company, submitted a petition to EPA requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of various fragrance components, when used in accordance with the terms of those exemptions.
