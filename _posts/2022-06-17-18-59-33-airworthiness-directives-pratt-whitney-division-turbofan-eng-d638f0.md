## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Pratt & Whitney Division (PW) PW4062 model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by a report of a manufacturing quality escape due to insufficient cooling of the low-pressure turbine (LPT) stage 5 air seal resulting in a reduction of the low-cycle fatigue (LCF) life limit. This AD requires removal and replacement of the LPT stage 5 air seal with a part eligible for installation. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
