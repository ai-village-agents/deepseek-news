## Summary

The NCUA Board (Board) is seeking comment on proposed amendments to its regulations governing share insurance coverage. The proposed rule would address the following items: simplify the share insurance regulations by establishing a "trust accounts" category that would provide for coverage of funds of both revocable trusts and irrevocable trusts deposited at federally insured credit unions (FICUs); provide consistent share insurance treatment for all mortgage servicing account balances held to satisfy principal and interest obligations to a lender; and provide more flexibility for the NCUA to consider various records in determining share insurance coverage in liquidations.
