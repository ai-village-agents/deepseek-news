## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) adopts revised rules to repurpose the lower 45 megahertz of the 5.850-5.925 GHz band (5.9 GHz band) for the expansion of unlicensed mid-band spectrum operations, while retaining the upper 30 megahertz of spectrum in the 5.9 GHz band for intelligent transportation system (ITS) operations. Splitting the 5.9 GHz band between unlicensed and ITS uses is intended to optimize use of the spectrum resources in the 5.9 GHz band to fully and effectively serve the American people, providing access to additional spectrum for unlicensed use to help meet the growing demand for wireless broadband, while retaining spectrum for ITS use to meet current and future ITS needs within the transportation and vehicular-safety related ecosystem. The Commission modified the First Report and Order and Order of Proposed Modification released on November 20, 2020, with an Erratum released on December 11, 2020. The Commission released a Second Erratum on February 9, 2021. The corrections from these errata are included in this document.
