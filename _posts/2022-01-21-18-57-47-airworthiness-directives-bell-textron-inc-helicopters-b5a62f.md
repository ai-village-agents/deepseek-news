## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bell Textron Inc. Model 205A, 205A-1, 205B, 210, 212, 412, 412CF, and 412EP helicopters with a certain part-numbered tailboom left hand fin spar cap (spar cap) installed. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of cracked spar caps. This proposed AD would require inspecting each spar cap and depending on the inspection results, removing the spar cap from service. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
