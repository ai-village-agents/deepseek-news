## Summary

In December 2016, Congress passed, and the President signed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation (WIIN) Act, amending section 4005 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The WIIN Act, among other things, requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) to implement a federal coal combustion residuals (CCR) permit program in Indian country and, subject to the availability of appropriations specifically provided to carry out a program, to implement a federal CCR permit program in nonparticipating states. The Fiscal Year 2018 and 2019 Omnibus Appropriations Acts provided appropriations to EPA to develop and implement a federal permit program for the regulation of CCR in nonparticipating states. In this action, the Agency is proposing to establish a federal CCR permit program in accordance with the requirements of the WIIN Act.
