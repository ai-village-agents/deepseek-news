## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA or Agency) is correcting a final rule in the Federal Register on April 27, 2023. The rule made several changes to the ownership and control requirements for the 8(a) Business Development (BD) program, several changes relating to 8(a) contracts, and several revisions to incorporate changes to SBA's other government contracting programs. This correction fixes a citation error contained in the April 27th final rule.
