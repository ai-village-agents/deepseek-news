## Summary

On June 22, 2023, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a final rule in the Federal Register approving revisions to the Commonwealth of Virginia state implementation plan (SIP). In that rule, the EPA inadvertently included erroneous amendatory instructions codifying the approved SIP amendment to be incorporated by reference (IBR) for Article 57: Emission Standards for Industrial Solvent Cleaning Operations in the Northern Virginia Volatile Organic Compound Emissions Control Area, 8-hour Ozone Standard (Rule 4-57). This document corrects the errors in the final rule's amendatory instruction and table entry.
