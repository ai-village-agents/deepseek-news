## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) invites public comment on its Request for Information (RFI) number DE-FOA-0003186 regarding the state of technology on the progression to net-zero emission propulsion technologies for the rail industry. The purpose of this RFI is to aggregate knowledge from rail stakeholders to help direct actions regarding future propulsion technologies, infrastructure requirements, and coordination among key stakeholders to ensure that the rail sector is meeting or exceeding U.S. decarbonization milestones. DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) is specifically interested in information on the rail industry's current alternative fuels trajectory, the driving forces behind it, and the key barriers to achieving this transition.
