## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all ATR--GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42 and Model ATR72 airplanes. This AD was prompted by the insufficient accuracy of a certain Angle of Attack (AoA) probe at low airspeeds which could lead to a delayed activation of the stick pusher in a flaps-extended configuration. This AD requires replacing each affected part with a serviceable part, and also prohibits the installation of affected parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
