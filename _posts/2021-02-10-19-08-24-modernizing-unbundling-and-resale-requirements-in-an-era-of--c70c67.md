# Modernizing Unbundling and Resale Requirements in an Era of Next-Generation Networks and Services; Correction

**Published:** February 05, 2026 19:08 UTC

## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission published a document in the Federal Register on January 8, 2021, announcing the elimination of unbundling and resale requirements where they stifle technology transitions and broadband deployment, and the preservation of unbundling requirements where they are still necessary to realize the 1996 Act's goal of robust intermodal competition benefiting all Americans. There is a typographical error in the rules section of this document, incorrectly referring to the heading as "Availability of DS1 loops" when it should read "Availability of DS3 loops."
