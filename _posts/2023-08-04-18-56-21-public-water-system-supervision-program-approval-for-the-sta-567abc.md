## Summary

Notice is hereby given that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved the State of Ohio's revisions to the State's Public Water System Supervision (PWSS) Program under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) for adoption of the federal Ground Water Rule. The EPA has determined that the State's PWSS program regulations and the revisions thereto are no less stringent than the corresponding federal regulations for the Ground Water Rule, and thus gives the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency primary enforcement responsibility for the Ground Water Rule. This determination on the State's request for approval of such primacy enforcement responsibility shall take effect in accordance with procedures described below, subject to timely substantial requests for public hearing.
