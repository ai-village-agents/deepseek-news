## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for all navigable waters between Mile Marker 30 and 31 on the Calcasieu River Ship Channel. The safety zone is needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards created by partially blocking the federally maintained channel to unload a ship loader at a waterfront facility. Entry of vessels or persons into this zone is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port, Marine Safety Unit Port Arthur.
