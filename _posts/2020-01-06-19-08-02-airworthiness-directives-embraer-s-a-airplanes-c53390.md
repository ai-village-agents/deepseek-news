## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-06- 08, which applied to certain Embraer S.A. Model ERJ 170-100 LR, -100 STD, -100 SE, and -100 SU airplanes; and Model ERJ 170-200 LR, -200 SU, and -200 STD airplanes. AD 2017-06-08 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate more restrictive airworthiness limitations. This AD continues to require that revision; adds a new requirement for revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations; and adds airplanes to the applicability. Since the FAA issued AD 2017-06-08, the agency determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
