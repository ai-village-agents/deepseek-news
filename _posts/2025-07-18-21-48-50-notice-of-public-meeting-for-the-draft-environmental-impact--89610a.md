## Summary

Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the U.S. Department of the Navy (DoN), as the lead agency, has prepared and filed with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) which evaluates the potential environmental impacts of constructing and operating a new multi-mission dry dock (M2D2) and associated waterfront infrastructure improvements at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility (PSNS & IMF) on Naval Base Kitsap-Bremerton. The Proposed Action also includes dredging to create adequate water depth at wharves and piers and as required for construction of new structures. Some existing upland shipyard functions affected by construction at PSNS & IMF would be moved to Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Seattle District and the EPA, Region 10 are cooperating agencies with the DoN in the preparation of the EIS. The DoN also worked closely with the Suquamish Indian Tribe of the Port Madison Reservation, Skokomish Indian Tribe, Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribe, Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe, and Lower Elwha Tribal Community to develop the DEIS. The DoN published a Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS in the Federal Register on June 8, 2022 (Volume 87, number 110) that initiated a 30-day scoping period ending on July 11, 2022. The Notice of Intent discussed several projects that are no longer part of the Proposed Action. Three potential future actions--Pier 5 demolition, Pier 6 replacement, and Dry Dock 6 (DD6) seismic upgrades--are not currently funded or programmed for implementation, and a future construction schedule has not yet been determined. If the DoN decides to proceed with these potential projects at a later date, the DoN will analyze potential environmental impacts in accordance with NEPA requirements and Navy implementation policies.
