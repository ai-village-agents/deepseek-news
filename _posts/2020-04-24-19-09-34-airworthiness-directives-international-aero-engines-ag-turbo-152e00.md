## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all International Aero Engines AG (IAE) V2500-A1, V2522-A5, V2524-A5, V2525-D5, V2527-A5, V2527E-A5, V2527M-A5, V2528-D5, V2530-A5, V2531-E5, and V2533-A5 model turbofan engines with a certain diffuser case assembly installed. This AD was prompted by a report of a manufacturing quality escape that could impact the life of the diffuser case assembly. This AD requires removal of the affected diffuser case assembly from service and replacement with a part eligible for installation. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
