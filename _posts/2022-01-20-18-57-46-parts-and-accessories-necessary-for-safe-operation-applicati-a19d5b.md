## Summary

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) announces its decision to grant the limited 5-year exemption requested by Waste Management Inc. (Waste Management) to allow all of its operating companies, which currently number 106, to replace the high- mounted brake lights on their owned and operated fleets of heavy-duty refuse and support trucks with red or amber brake-activated pulsating lamps positioned in the upper center position, or in an upper dual outboard position, in addition to the steady burning brake lamps required by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs). The Agency has determined that granting the exemption would likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to or greater than the level of safety provided by the regulation.
