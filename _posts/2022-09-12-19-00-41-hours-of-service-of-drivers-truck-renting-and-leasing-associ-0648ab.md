## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to provisionally renew the Truck Renting and Leasing Association, Inc. (TRALA) exemption from the provisions that require a motor carrier to install and require each of its drivers to use an electronic logging device (ELD) to record the driver's hours-of-service (HOS). The exemption allows drivers of property carrying commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) rented for 8 days or less, regardless of reason, to not use an ELD in the vehicle. These drivers remain subject to the standard HOS limits and must maintain a paper record of duty status (RODS) if required. The exemption renewal is for 5 years.
