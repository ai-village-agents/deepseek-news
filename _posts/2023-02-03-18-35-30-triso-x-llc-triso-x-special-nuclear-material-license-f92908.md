## Summary

The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) received a license application, by letters dated April 5, 2022, and September 23, 2022, from TRISO-X, LLC to possess and use special nuclear material for the manufacture of high-assay low-enriched uranium fuel at a fuel fabrication facility, to be located in Roane County, Tennessee. TRISO- X, LLC seeks a special nuclear material license for a term of 40 years to manufacture fuel, consisting of coated uranium particles enriched to less than 20 weight percent uranium[hyphen]235 (Uranium-235) for use in advanced commercial reactors. Because the license application contains Sensitive Unclassified Non-Safeguards Information and Safeguards Information, an order imposes procedures to obtain access to this type of information for contention preparation.
