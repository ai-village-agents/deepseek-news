## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the Imperial County Air Pollution Control District (ICAPCD) portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). This revision concerns emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) from natural gas-fired water heaters. We are proposing to approve a local rule to regulate these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the "Act"). We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
