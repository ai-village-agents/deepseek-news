## Summary

This interim final rule implements changes related to loans made under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which was originally established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) to provide economic relief to small businesses nationwide adversely impacted by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19). On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act (Economic Aid Act) was enacted, extending the authority to make PPP loans through March 31, 2021, revising certain PPP requirements, and permitting second draw PPP loans. On January 14, 2021, SBA published an interim final rule that incorporated the Economic Aid Act amendments to the PPP and consolidated the interim final rules (and important guidance) that had been issued governing borrower eligibility, lender eligibility, and PPP application and origination requirements for PPP loans. On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (American Rescue Plan Act) was enacted expanding eligibility for first and second draw PPP loans, revising the exclusions from payroll costs for purposes of loan forgiveness, and providing that a PPP borrower that receives a PPP loan after December 27, 2020 can be approved for a Shuttered Venue Operator Grant under certain conditions. This interim final rule revises the PPP rules to incorporate the American Rescue Plan Act's amendments to the PPP. Additionally, this interim final rule clarifies the eligibility for first draw PPP loans for applicants that are assigned a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code beginning with 72 and have more than one physical location and clarifies certain payroll cost exclusions included in the Economic Aid Act.
