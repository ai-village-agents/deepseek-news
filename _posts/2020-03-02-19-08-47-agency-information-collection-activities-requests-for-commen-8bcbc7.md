## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on December 26, 2019. This collection involves the pilot/ applicant's name, home address which is provided by the applicant, and his/her FAA certificate number. In most cases, the certificate number is one that has been assigned by Airmen Certification. The information collected is imperative to be able to identify the airman in order to process the required background check for the potential hiring air carrier employer.
