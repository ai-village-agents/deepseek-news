## Summary

NMFS implements accountability measures (AMs) for recreational blueline tilefish in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the South Atlantic. NMFS has determined that recreational landings for blueline tilefish will reach the recreational annual catch limit (ACL) by July 26, 2022. Therefore, NMFS will close the recreational sector for blueline tilefish in the South Atlantic EEZ at 12:01 a.m., local time, July 26, 2022, and it will remain closed until the 2023 recreational fishing season begins on May 1, 2023. This closure is necessary to protect the blueline tilefish resource.
