## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), recently proposed to reclassify the beach layia (Layia carnosa) as a threatened species with a rule issued under section 4(d) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. We are reopening the proposed rule comment period to give all interested parties an additional opportunity to comment on the proposed rule, and we announce a public informational meeting and public hearing on the proposed rule. Comments previously submitted need not be resubmitted as they are already incorporated into the public record and will be fully considered in the final rule.
