## Summary

The Department of Transportation (DOT) seeks to maximize the use of American-made products and materials in all federally funded projects as part of the Biden-Harris Administration's implementation of the Build America, Buy America Act (the Act), which was included in the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). The implementation of this law will transform the Department's approach to domestic procurement requirements. The Department is taking three concurrent actions: (1) DOT is not extending its temporary waiver for construction materials, making that requirement applicable effective November 10, 2022; (2) in a separate notice, DOT is proposing a waiver for narrow categories of contracts and solicitations; and (3) in this notice, DOT is proposing a narrow waiver to allow DOT and its assistance recipients to focus their domestic sourcing efforts on products that provide the greatest manufacturing opportunities for American workers and firms and reduce delays in the delivery of important transportation infrastructure projects that provide jobs and promote economic growth. DOT is seeking comments on whether a waiver of Buy America requirements under the Act and related domestic preference statutes administered by DOT and its Operating Administrations (OAs) should be granted in the public interest for de minimis costs, small grants, and minor components.
