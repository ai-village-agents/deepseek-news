## Summary

This action establishes a Class E airspace area extending upward from 1,200 feet above the surface over the State of North Dakota and removes the enroute domestic airspace areas at Harvey and Linton, ND. This action is at the request of Salt Lake Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) and Minneapolis ARTCC to simplify and close gaps in the existing class E airspace extending upward from 1,200 feet above the surface over the State of North Dakota; provide transitional airspace to support instrument flight rule (IFR) operations to and from the terminal and enroute environments within the state; and to improve air traffic control services over the state of North Dakota.
