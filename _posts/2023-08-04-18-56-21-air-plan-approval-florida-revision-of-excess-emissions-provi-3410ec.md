## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of Florida on November 22, 2016, and supplemented on September 30, 2022, through the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP). The November 22, 2016, SIP revision is in response to EPA's SIP Call published on June 12, 2015, concerning excess emissions during startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) events. The September 30, 2022, supplemental SIP revision addresses additional SSM-related rule amendments identified by the State and the addition of source specific sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) and nitrogen oxide (NO<INF>X</INF>) emission limits. EPA is approving these SIP revisions and finds that they correct the deficiencies identified in the June 12, 2015, SIP Call. EPA is also approving a portion of a SIP revision submitted by FDEP on April 1, 2022, which modifies provisions that regulate emissions of SO<INF>2</INF>, NO<INF>X</INF>, and visible emissions and modifies requirements for major stationary sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and NO<INF>X</INF>.
