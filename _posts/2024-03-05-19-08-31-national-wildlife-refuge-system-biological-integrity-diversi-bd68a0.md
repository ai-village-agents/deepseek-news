## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are extending the comment period on our February 2, 2024, proposed rule that proposes new regulations and updates to existing policy to ensure that the biological integrity, diversity, and environmental health (BIDEH) of the National Wildlife Refuge System (Refuge System) are maintained, and where appropriate, restored and enhanced, in accordance with the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997. We are extending the comment period for 60 days to give all interested parties an additional opportunity to comment. Comments previously submitted need not be resubmitted as they are already incorporated into the public record and will be fully considered in our final determination.
