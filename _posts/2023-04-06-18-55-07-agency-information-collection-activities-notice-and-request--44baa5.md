## Summary

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) invites public comments about our intention to request approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for an extension of a currently approved information collection. Before a Federal agency can collect certain information from the public, it must receive approval from OMB. Under procedures established by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, before seeking OMB approval, Federal agencies must solicit public comment on proposed collections of information. This document describes an existing collection of information for NHTSA's Automated Vehicle Transparency and Engagement for Safe Testing (AV TEST) Initiative for which NHTSA intends to seek renewed OMB approval. The AV TEST Initiative involves the voluntary collection of information from entities testing vehicles equipped with automated driving systems (ADS) and from States and local authorities involved in the regulation of ADS testing. The purpose of this collection is to provide information to the public about ADS testing operations in the U.S. and applicable State and local laws, regulations, and guidelines.
