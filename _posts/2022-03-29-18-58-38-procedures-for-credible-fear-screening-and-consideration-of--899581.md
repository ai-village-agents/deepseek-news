## Summary

On August 20, 2021, the Department of Homeland Security ("DHS") and the Department of Justice ("DOJ") (collectively "the Departments") published a notice of proposed rulemaking ("NPRM" or "proposed rule") that proposed amending regulations governing the procedures for determining certain protection claims and available parole procedures for individuals subject to expedited removal and found to have a credible fear of persecution or torture. After a careful review of the comments received, the Departments are now issuing an interim final rule ("rule" or "IFR") that responds to comments received in response to the NPRM and adopts the proposed rule with changes. Most significantly, the IFR provides that DHS's United States Citizenship and Immigration Services ("USCIS") will refer noncitizens whose applications are not granted to DOJ's Executive Office for Immigration Review ("EOIR") for streamlined removal proceedings. The IFR also establishes timelines for the consideration of applications for asylum and related protection by USCIS and, as needed, EOIR. This IFR responds to comments received in response to the NPRM and adopts the NPRM with changes as described in this rule. The Departments solicit further public comment on the IFR's revisions, which will be considered and addressed in a future rule.
