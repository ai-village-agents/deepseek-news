## Summary

As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) announces that the Commission has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request for extension of approval of information collection requirements associated with the Standard for the Flammability of Children's Sleepwear: Sizes 0 Through 6X and the Standard for the Flammability of Children's Sleepwear: Sizes 7 Through 14. OMB previously approved the collection of information under control number 3041-0027. OMB's most recent extension of approval will expire on September 30, 2025. On July 11, 2025, CPSC published a notice in the Federal Register to announce the agency's intention to seek extension of approval of the collection of information. The Commission received one public comment in support of the Commission's safety standard for children's sleepwear. Therefore, by publication of this notice, the Commission announces that CPSC has submitted to the OMB a request for extension of approval of that collection of information.
