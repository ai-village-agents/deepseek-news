## Summary

We are adopting interim final amendments to Forms 20-F, 40-F, 10-K, and N-CSR to implement the disclosure and submission requirements of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act ("HFCA Act"). The interim final amendments will apply to registrants that the Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in that jurisdiction. Consistent with the HFCA Act, the amendments require the submission of documentation to the Commission establishing that such a registrant is not owned or controlled by a governmental entity in that foreign jurisdiction and also require disclosure in a foreign issuer's annual report regarding the audit arrangements of, and governmental influence on, such registrants.
