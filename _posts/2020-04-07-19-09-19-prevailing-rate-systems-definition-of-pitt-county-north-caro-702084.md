## Summary

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing a final rule to define Pitt County, North Carolina, as an area of application county to the Wayne, NC, nonappropriated fund (NAF) Federal Wage System (FWS) wage area. This change is necessary because there is one NAF FWS employee working in Pitt County, and the county is not currently defined to a NAF wage area.
