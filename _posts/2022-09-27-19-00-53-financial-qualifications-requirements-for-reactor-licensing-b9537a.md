## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is discontinuing a rulemaking activity that would have revised the current financial qualification requirements of "reasonable assurance" to the review standard of "appears to be financially qualified." The purpose of this document is to inform members of the public that the NRC is discontinuing this rulemaking activity. The staff will address financial qualifications during the development of an ongoing rulemaking activity to establish a risk-informed, technology inclusive regulatory framework for advanced reactors.
