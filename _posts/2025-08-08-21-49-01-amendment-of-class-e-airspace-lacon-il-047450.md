## Summary

This action amends the Class E airspace at Lacon, IL, and updates the geographic coordinates of the Marshall County Airport, Lacon, IL, to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database. This action is the result of an airspace review conducted due to the decommissioning of the Bradford very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program. It brings the airspace into compliance with FAA orders and supports instrument flight rule (IFR) procedures and operations.
