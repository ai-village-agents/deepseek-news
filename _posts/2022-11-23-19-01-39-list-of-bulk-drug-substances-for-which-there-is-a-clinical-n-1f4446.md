## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is developing a list of bulk drug substances (active pharmaceutical ingredients) for which there is a clinical need (the 503B Bulks List). Drug products that outsourcing facilities compound using bulk drug substances on the 503B Bulks List can qualify for certain exemptions from the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) provided certain conditions are met. This notice identifies two bulk drug substances that FDA has considered and proposes to include on the 503B Bulks List to compound three categories of compounded drug products: arginine hydrochloride (HCl) for oral use, lysine HCl for oral use, and lysine HCl for intravenous use in combination with FDA-approved, single-ingredient arginine HCl for intravenous use. This notice identifies three bulk drug substances that FDA has considered and proposes not to include on the 503B Bulks List: etomidate, furosemide, and rocuronium bromide. Additional bulk drug substances nominated for inclusion on this list are under consideration and may be the subject of future notices.
