## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-26- 01, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. AD 2019-26-01 required repetitive detailed inspections, and applicable corrective actions, and provided an optional modification that terminated the inspections. Since the FAA issued AD 2019-26-01, a determination was made that a related production modification was not properly installed on certain airplanes. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2019-26-01, and, for certain airplanes, adds a one- time detailed inspection of the modification for proper installation, and applicable corrective actions if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
