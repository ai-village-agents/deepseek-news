# Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Designation of Experimental Populations

## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish Wildlife Service (Service), propose to revise the regulations concerning experimental populations of endangered species and threatened species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). We are proposing to remove language generally restricting the introduction of experimental populations to only the species' "historical range" to allow for the introduction of populations into habitat outside of their historical range for conservation purposes. To provide for the conservation of certain species, we have concluded that it may be increasingly necessary and appropriate to establish experimental populations outside of their historical range if the ability of the habitat to support one or more life history stages has been reduced due to threats, such as climate change or invasive species. We are also proposing minor changes to clarify the existing regulations. These minor changes are not intended to alter the substance or scope of the regulations.
