## Summary

The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) is amending the regulation governing the Food for Progress Program to update citations and make other technical and clarifying changes. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) revised and renumbered certain provisions in its regulations regarding universal identifiers, the System for Award Management, and the uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for Federal awards. This amendment makes technical corrections to the Food for Progress Program regulation to reflect the revised OMB regulations, and it makes other minor changes intended to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the program.
