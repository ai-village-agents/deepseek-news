## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for Upper Mississippi River at mile marker 202.5 to 203.2. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters near Alton, IL, during a power boat championship race on June 21, 2024, through June 24, 2024. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Sector Upper Mississippi River or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
