## Summary

The FAA is correcting an airworthiness directive (AD) that was published in the Federal Register. That AD applies to certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-2B16 (601-3A, 601-3R, and 604 Variants) airplanes. As published, the AD number specified in the regulatory text is incorrect. This document corrects that error and one other minor error. In all other respects, the original document remains the same.
