## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to rescind the federal implementation plan (FIP) that regulates emissions from the Navajo Generating Station (NGS), a coal-fired power plant that was located on the reservation lands of the Navajo Nation near Page, Arizona. NGS permanently ceased operations on November 18, 2019, and the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act") operating permit for this facility has expired.
