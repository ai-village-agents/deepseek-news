## Summary

As a result of the determinations by the Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) order on diamond sawblades and parts thereof (diamond sawblades) from the People's Republic of China (China) would likely lead to a continuation or recurrence of dumping, and material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation of the AD order.
