## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Airbus Helicopters Model AS332C, AS332C1, AS332L, and AS332L1 helicopters. This AD requires inspecting the attachment screws of each main gearbox (MGB) suspension bar rear attachment fitting, and depending on the outcome, applying a sealing compound, performing further inspections, and replacing affected parts. This AD was prompted by reports of an elongated attachment screw and loss of tightening torque of the nut. The actions of this AD are intended to address an unsafe condition on these products.
