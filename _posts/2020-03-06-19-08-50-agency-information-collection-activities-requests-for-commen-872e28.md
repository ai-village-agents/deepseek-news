## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves the collection of data for the Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) to demonstrate voluntary participation with safety enhancements (SE). The CAST SEs are recommended best practices and implementation of the SEs is voluntary. It is vital for CAST to know the level of implantation of the SEs in order to determine the level of risk reduction in commercial aviation. To support this assessment CAST decided to gather information regarding the extent to which these SEs have been implemented by air carriers so it can determine if further action is required. To facilitate this data collection for CAST, the FAA has developed an information collection (questionnaire) for key SEs that air carriers and operators are asked to complete using the FAA's existing web-based system, Web-based Operations Safety System (WebOPSS). Completion of the questionnaires is voluntary, and is requested of all current, now 61, part 121 certificate holders that the FAA oversees.
