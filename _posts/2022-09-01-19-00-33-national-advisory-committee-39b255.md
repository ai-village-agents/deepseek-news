## Summary

The Census Bureau is giving notice of a virtual meeting of the National Advisory Committee (NAC). This special session will provide an opportunity for the NAC to submit additional recommendations related to the 2020 Demographic and Housing Characteristics File (DHC) prior to the October 2022 Data Stewardship Executive Policy Committee (DSEP) meeting where the final privacy-loss budget and parameter settings will be determined for the 2020 DHC. Additionally, the Census Bureau SMEs will present metrics from the Round II 2010 Demonstration Data Product and summarize what they tell us about data accuracy and change from previous demonstration products. There will also be a presentation on the simulated re-identification attack on the Round II 2010 Demonstration Data Product. Last-minute changes to the schedule are possible, which could prevent giving advance public notice of schedule adjustments.
