## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission" or "SEC") is proposing new rules ("proposed conflicts rules") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Advisers Act") to eliminate, or neutralize the effect of, certain conflicts of interest associated with broker-dealers' or investment advisers' interactions with investors through these firms' use of technologies that optimize for, predict, guide, forecast, or direct investment-related behaviors or outcomes. The Commission is also proposing amendments to rules under the Exchange Act and Advisers Act that would require firms to make and maintain certain records in accordance with the proposed conflicts rules.
