## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) concerning the provisions for Clean Fuels for Fleets (CFF) for the 2015 ozone national ambient air quality standards ("2015 ozone NAAQS") in the Riverside County (Coachella Valley), Sacramento Metro, San Joaquin Valley, Los Angeles--South Coast Air Basin (South Coast), Ventura County, and Los Angeles--San Bernardino Counties (West Mojave Desert) nonattainment areas (NAAs). The SIP revisions include the "California Clean Fuels for Fleets Certification for the 70 ppb Ozone Standard" ("Clean Fuels for Fleets Certification") submitted on February 3, 2022. We are proposing to approve these revisions under the Clean Air Act (CAA or "the Act"), which establishes clean fuels for fleets requirements for "Serious," "Severe," and "Extreme" ozone NAAs.
