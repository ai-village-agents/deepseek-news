# Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Direct Expansion-Dedicated Outdoor Air Systems

## Summary

In this final rule, DOE is establishing energy conservation standards for direct expansion-dedicated outdoor air systems ("DX- DOASes") that are of equivalent stringency as the minimum levels specified in the most recent publication of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers ("ASHRAE") Standard 90.1 "Energy Standard for Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings" ("ASHRAE 90.1-2019") when tested pursuant to the DOE test procedure for DX-DOASes--which incorporates by reference the most recent applicable industry standard for this equipment. DOE has determined that it lacks clear and convincing evidence to adopt standards more stringent than the levels specified in ASHRAE 90.1-2019.
