## Summary

In response to the Russian Federation's (Russia's) further invasion of Ukraine, the Department of Commerce is expanding the existing sanctions against the Russian industry sector by adding a new prohibition under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) that targets the oil refinery sector in Russia. These new export controls will further limit revenue that could support the military capabilities of Russia.
