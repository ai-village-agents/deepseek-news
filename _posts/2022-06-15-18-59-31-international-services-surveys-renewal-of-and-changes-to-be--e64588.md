## Summary

This proposed rule would amend regulations of the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to renew reporting requirements for the BE-120 Benchmark Survey of Transactions in Selected Services and Intellectual Property with Foreign Persons. This proposed rule would also amend the regulations for BEA's two other international services benchmark surveys, the BE-140 Benchmark Survey of Insurance Transactions by U.S. Insurance Companies with Foreign Persons and the BE-180 Benchmark Survey of Financial Services Transactions between U.S. Financial Services Providers and Foreign Persons, to clarify when the surveys will be conducted.
