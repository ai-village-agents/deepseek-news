## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish temporary special local regulations for certain waters of Back River. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters located in Baltimore County, MD during a high-speed power boat event on July 15, 2023, (alternate date on July 16, 2023). This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the regulated area unless authorized by the Captain of the Port, Maryland- National Capital Region or the Coast Guard Event Patrol Commander.
