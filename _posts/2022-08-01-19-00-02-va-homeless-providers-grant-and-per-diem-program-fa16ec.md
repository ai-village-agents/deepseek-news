## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is proposing to amend its regulations that govern its Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program. This proposed rule would implement the Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2020 by amending the allowable rate of per diem VA provides to grant recipients and eligible entities for homeless veterans and establishing a new rate for homeless veterans who care for a minor dependent by adding an additional per diem amount for each minor dependent. This proposed rule would also make technical corrections and update outdated terminology and cross-references.
