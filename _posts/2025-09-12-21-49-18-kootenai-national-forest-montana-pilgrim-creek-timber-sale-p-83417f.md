## Summary

The USDA Forest Service is giving notice of its intent to prepare a supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS) for the Pilgrim Creek Timber Sale Project on the Cabinet Ranger District of the Kootenai National Forest, in Montana. Forest Supervisor Chadwick Benson plans to prepare a SEIS to update assumptions related to closed roads barrier effectiveness, in alignment with the monitoring data that has been reported and incorporates results of Endangered Species Act consultation consistent with Case No. 9:18-cv-00067-DWM Memorandum and Decision Order (October 3, 2019). The environmental analysis will follow 36 CFR 220 (rescinded in 2025 by 90 FR 29632). The original project was developed using 36 CFR 220 regulations. The Forest has chosen to complete the SEIS using the same regulations as the original EIS.
