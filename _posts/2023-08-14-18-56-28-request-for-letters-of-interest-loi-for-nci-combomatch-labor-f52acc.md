## Summary

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) through its National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) has developed a successor precision medicine trial to `NCI-Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (NCI- MATCH)' entitled `NCI-ComboMATCH'. The principle of this initiative is to overcome drug resistance to single-agent therapy by developing genomically-directed targeted agent combinations. All combinations must be supported by robust, preclinical in vivo evidence.
