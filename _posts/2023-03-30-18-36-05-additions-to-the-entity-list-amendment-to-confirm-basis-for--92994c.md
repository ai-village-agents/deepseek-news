## Summary

In this rule, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by adding eleven entities to the Entity List under the destinations of Burma, the People's Republic of China (China), Nicaragua, and Russia. These eleven entities have been determined by the U.S. Government to be acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. In this rule, BIS also amends the EAR to explicitly confirm that the foreign policy interest of protecting human rights worldwide is a basis for adding entities to the Entity List.
