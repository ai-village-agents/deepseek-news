## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing for public comment and for trial use, a new regulatory guide (RG) 1.247, "Acceptability of Probabilistic Risk Assessment Results for Non-Light Water Reactor Risk-Informed Activities." This new guidance describes one acceptable approach for determining whether the acceptability of the probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) used to support a PRA application is sufficient to provide confidence in the results for non- light water reactors (NLWRs) and risk-informed activities. As a trial RG, this issuance does not provide final staff positions and the guidance within may be revised based on experience obtained by the NRC with its use after its publication.
