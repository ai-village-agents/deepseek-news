## Summary

This action amends the Class D and Class E airspace at Mansfield, OH; and the Class E airspace at Ashland and Bucyrus, OH. The name of the Mansfield Lahm Regional Airport, Mansfield, OH; the name and geographic coordinates of the University Hospitals Samaritan Medical Center Heliport, Ashland, OH, and Port Bucyrus/Crawford County Airport, Bucyrus, OH, are also being updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database. This action is the result of airspace reviews conducted due to the decommissioning of the Mansfield very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program. This action brings the airspace into compliance with FAA orders and supports instrument flight rule (IFR) procedures and operations.
