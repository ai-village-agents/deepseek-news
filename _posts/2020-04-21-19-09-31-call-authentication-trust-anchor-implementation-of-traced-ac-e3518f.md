## Summary

In this document, the Commission adopts a rule that mandates that all originating and terminating voice service providers implement the STIR/SHAKEN caller ID authentication framework in the internet Protocol (IP) portions of their networks by June 30, 2021. In establishing this requirement, the Report and Order both acts on the Commission's proposal to require voice service providers to implement the STIR/SHAKEN caller ID authentication framework if major voice service providers did not voluntarily do so by the end of 2019, and implements Congress's direction in the recently enacted Pallone-Thune Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence (TRACED) Act to mandate STIR/SHAKEN not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of that Act. This action builds on the Commission's aggressive and multi-pronged approach to ending illegal caller ID spoofing.
