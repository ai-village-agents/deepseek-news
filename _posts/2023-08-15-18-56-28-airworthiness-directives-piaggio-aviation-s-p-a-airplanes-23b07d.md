## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Piaggio Aviation S.p.A. (Piaggio) Model P-180 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of corrosion-induced cracking on the horizontal tail trim actuator (HTTA) fitting assembly. This AD requires repetitively inspecting the HTTA fitting assembly for corrosion and cracking until the HTTA fitting assembly is replaced with a new part. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
