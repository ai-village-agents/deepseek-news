## Summary

FCA US LLC (f/k/a Chrysler Group LLC) ("FCA US") has determined that certain model year (MY) 2019-2020 Ram 4500/5500 Cab Chassis motor vehicles equipped with Mopar rear brake hoses and replacement brake hoses sold to FCA US dealers do not fully comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 106, Brake Hoses. FCA US filed two noncompliance reports with NHTSA (the "Agency"), both dated October 22, 2020. FCA US subsequently petitioned NHTSA on November 13, 2020, for a decision that the subject noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. This document announces and explains the denial of FCA US's petition.
