## Summary

This action proposes to remove one Jet Route, J-105, and amend four VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways, V-15, V-63, V- 272, and V-583, in the vicinity of McAlester, OK. The modifications are necessary due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the McAlester, OK, VOR/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) navigation aid (NAVAID), which provides navigation guidance for portions of the affected air traffic service (ATS) routes. The McAlester VOR is being decommissioned as part of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
