## Summary

This final rule adopts, with minor changes, an interim rule published in the Federal Register on February 13, 2020. The interim rule implemented changes to RCPP that were either necessitated by the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (the 2018 Farm Bill) and changes for administrative streamlining improvements and clarifications. CCC amended this interim rule with a technical correction on March 17, 2020. NRCS received input from 65 commenters who provided 335 comments in response to the interim rule. This final rule makes permanent the provisions of the interim rule, responds to comments received, and makes further adjustments in response to some of the comments received.
