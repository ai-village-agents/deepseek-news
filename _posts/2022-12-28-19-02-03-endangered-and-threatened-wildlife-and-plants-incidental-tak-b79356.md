## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), have received an application to amend the incidental take permit (PRT- 840414) issued for the existing Multiple Species Conservation Program County of San Diego Subarea Plan (MSCP Subarea Plan). The County of San Diego (Applicant) has requested an amendment to the incidental take permit. The amendment would modify the MSCP Subarea Plan boundary to add approximately 77 acres of land solely for conservation purposes. If amended, no additional incidental take will be authorized. The Applicant will follow all other existing habitat conservation plan conditions. We also announce a public comment period. We invite comments from the public and Federal, Tribal, State, and local governments.
