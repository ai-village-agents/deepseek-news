## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by incidents related to throttle malfunctions during a balked landing with the auto-throttle (A/T) engaged, potential erroneous readings from the low range radio altimeter (LRRA), and possible deficiencies in low airspeed protections and crew alerting systems. This proposed AD would require updating the thrust management (TM) and displays and crew alerting (DCA) operational program software (OPS). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe conditions on these products.
