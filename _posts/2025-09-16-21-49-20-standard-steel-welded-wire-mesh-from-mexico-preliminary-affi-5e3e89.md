## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily determines that imports of certain low carbon steel (LCS) wire that are produced in Mexico and assembled or completed into standard steel welded wire mesh (welded wire mesh) in the United States are circumventing the antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on welded wire mesh from Mexico. As a result, all imports of certain LCS wire from Mexico imported by Deacero S.A.P.I. de C.V. (Deacero) will be subject to suspension of liquidation on or after April 2, 2024, and all other imports of certain LCS wire from Mexico will be subject to suspension of liquidation on or after the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register. Commerce is also imposing a certification requirement. We invite interested parties to comment on this preliminary determination.
