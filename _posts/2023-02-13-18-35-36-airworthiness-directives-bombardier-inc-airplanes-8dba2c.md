## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-1A10 and BD-700-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that certain airplane flight manuals (AFMs) contain figures with incorrect performance charts for landing on contaminated runways. This proposed AD would require revising the existing AFM to correct the affected performance charts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
