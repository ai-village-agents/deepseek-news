# Airworthiness Directives; Bombardier, Inc., Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-1A10 and BD-700-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by the discovery that existing maintenance tasks do not detect the potential failure of the passenger door detent mechanism because there is no procedure for inspecting the passenger door locking mechanism. This proposed AD would require revising the maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to require use of a certain aircraft maintenance manual (AMM) task during accomplishment of a specified maintenance check. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
