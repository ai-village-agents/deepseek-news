## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Leonardo S.p.a. (Leonardo) Model AW189 helicopters. This AD was prompted by two reported failures of the tail plane installation forward bolts (bolts). This AD requires inspecting the bolts and depending on the results of those inspections, removing certain parts from service or installing a tail plane retromod. This AD also requires torqueing certain part-numbered nuts, inspecting bolts and nuts for wear, and depending on the results of those inspections, removing parts from service. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
