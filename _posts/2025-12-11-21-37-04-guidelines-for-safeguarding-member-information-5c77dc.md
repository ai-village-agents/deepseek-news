# Guidelines for Safeguarding Member Information

## Summary

The NCUA Board (Board) is proposing to remove Appendix A to part 748, guidelines for safeguarding member information, from the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Appendix A was issued to satisfy the NCUA's statutory obligation to establish appropriate standards for federally insured credit unions (FICUs) to protect the security and confidentiality of customer records and information and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records. The Board now believes that the placement of Appendix A in the CFR may be confusing because Appendix A is not a regulation but rather a set of guidelines intended to assist FICUs with their statutory compliance obligations. The Board will remove Appendix A from the CFR and publish its contents as a Letter to Credit Unions, which enables more efficient revisions, and streamlines the NCUA's regulations.
