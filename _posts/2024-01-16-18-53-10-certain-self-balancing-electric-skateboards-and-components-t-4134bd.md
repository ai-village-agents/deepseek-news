## Summary

Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on December 5, 2023, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of Future Motion, Inc. of Santa Cruz, California. The complaint alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain self-balancing electric skateboards and components thereof by reason of the infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 9,400,505 ("the '505 patent"). The complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The complainant requests that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a general exclusion order, or in the alternative a limited exclusion order, and cease and desist orders. A motion for temporary relief filed concurrently with the complaint requests that the Commission issue a temporary exclusion order prohibiting the importation into and the sale within the United States after importation of certain self-balancing electric skateboards and components thereof during the course of the Commission's investigation.
