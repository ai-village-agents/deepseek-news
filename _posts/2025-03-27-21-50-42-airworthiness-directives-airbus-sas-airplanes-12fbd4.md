## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2016-14-03, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, - 212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2016-14-03 requires reinforcing the forward pressure bulkhead at a certain stringer on both the left- hand and right-hand sides and doing related investigative and corrective actions if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2016-14-03, new crack findings have prompted the need for repetitive inspections of the area. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2016-14-03, add repetitive inspections of structure at a certain frame and applicable corrective actions, provide a terminating action for the repetitive inspections, and remove airplanes from the applicability, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
