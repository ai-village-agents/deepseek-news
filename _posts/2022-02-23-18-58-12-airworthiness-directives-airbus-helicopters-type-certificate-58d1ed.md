## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-11- 25, which applied to certain Airbus Helicopters (type certificate previously held by Eurocopter France) Model AS350B3 and EC130T2 helicopters. AD 2021-11-25 required revising the existing rotorcraft flight manual (RFM) for your helicopter by inserting a new procedure (temporary). Since the FAA issued AD 2021-11-25, the manufacturer identified an additional affected full authority digital engine control (FADEC) part number and developed an optional modification for the affected FADECs. This AD requires revising the existing RFM for your helicopter by inserting a new procedure (temporary). This AD also requires, for helicopter on which an optional terminating action (installation of serviceable FADECs) was done, removing the applicable temporary procedure from the existing RFM for your helicopter. In addition, this AD also adds helicopters to the applicability. Furthermore, this AD prohibits the installation of an affected FADEC. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
