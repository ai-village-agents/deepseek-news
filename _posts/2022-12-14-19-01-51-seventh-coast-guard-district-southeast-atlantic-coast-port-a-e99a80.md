## Summary

The Coast Guard is beginning a series of studies to gather more information about routes used by ships, to access ports on the Southeast Atlantic Coast of the United States. This action is being taken in support of the provisions provided in Public Law 117-169, commonly referred to as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), and Executive Order on the Implementation of the Energy and Infrastructure Provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (E.O. 14082). These studies will be separate from, but may expand upon, the proposals in the other Coast Guard rulemakings.
