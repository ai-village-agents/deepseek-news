## Summary

The Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) proposes a funding priority and definitions under the State Personnel Development Grants (SPDG) program, which assists States in reforming and improving their systems for personnel preparation and personnel development in order to improve results for children with disabilities. We take this action to focus attention on the need to improve results for children with disabilities by empowering personnel to select professional development activities to improve their ability to serve children with disabilities. The Department may use the proposed priority and definitions for competitions in fiscal year (FY) 2020 and later years.
