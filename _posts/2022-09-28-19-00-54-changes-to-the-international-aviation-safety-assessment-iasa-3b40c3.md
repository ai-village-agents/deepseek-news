## Summary

This document describes policy changes, clarification, or restatement to the FAA's International Aviation Safety Assessment (IASA) program to enhance engagement with civil aviation authorities (CAAs) through pre- and post-IASA assessment and to promote greater transparency. The FAA is making these changes to IASA policy to better meet the FAA's mission and safety expectations of the U.S. traveling public; better mitigate international civil aviation safety risks; strengthen international relationships with CAAs toward sustained success in maintaining or obtaining proper safety oversight; and improve effectiveness, integration, and efficiency in executing the IASA process. This docuent modifies the IASA policies previously announced by the FAA.
