## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-09-04, which applies to certain The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER series airplanes, and certain Model 737-8 and -9 airplanes. AD 2023-09-04 requires inspecting all escape slide assemblies to identify affected parts and replacing affected escape slide assemblies with different assemblies. Since the FAA issued AD 2023-09-04, it was determined that additional airplanes might be affected by the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would retain the requirements of AD 2023-09-04 and require those actions for additional airplanes, including Model 737-8200 airplanes. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
