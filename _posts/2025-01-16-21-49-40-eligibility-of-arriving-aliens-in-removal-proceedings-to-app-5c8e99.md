## Summary

On May 12, 2006, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) published an interim final rule titled "Eligibility of Arriving Aliens in Removal Proceedings To Apply for Adjustment of Status and Jurisdiction To Adjudicate Applications for Adjustment of Status" The rule amended DHS and DOJ regulations governing applications for adjustment of status filed by paroled "arriving aliens" seeking to become lawful permanent residents and removed certain provisions. In that rule, DHS removed a paragraph from its regulations and redesignated the paragraph that followed to close the gap. DHS inadvertently failed to make a conforming amendment to a related regulatory provision to reflect the redesignation. This document describes the oversight and corrects the CFR. This action makes no substantive changes.
