## Summary

Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-94 specifies certain discount rates to be updated annually when the interest rate and inflation assumptions used to prepare the Budget of the United States Government are changed. These updated discount rates are found in Appendix C of the Circular and are to be used for cost- effectiveness analysis, including lease-purchase analysis, as specified in the revised Circular. These rates do not apply to regulatory analysis. The revised Appendix C of Circular No. A-94 can be accessed at https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CircularA- 94AppendixC.pdf.
