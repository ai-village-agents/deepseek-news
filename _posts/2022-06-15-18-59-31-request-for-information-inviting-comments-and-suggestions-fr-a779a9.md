## Summary

The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), in collaboration with the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), seek comments and input focusing on challenges, gaps, clinical needs, and research opportunities related to Pediatric Medical Devices (PMD) to inform priorities for a Public Private Partnership (PPP) to catalyze the national ecosystem. Such ecosystem will focus on optimizing the translation of technological advancements into medical devices designed, evaluated, and approved for pediatric populations to improve quality of life in this population. These comments are requested from public and private stakeholders such as, but not limited to, innovators, researchers, academic and medical centers, small- and large-scale industries, non-profit organizations, patients, providers, advocacy groups, payors, and federal agencies.
