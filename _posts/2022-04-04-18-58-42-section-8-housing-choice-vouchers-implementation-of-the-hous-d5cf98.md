## Summary

On July 15, 2020, HUD published a notice ("Implementation Notice") implementing the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) mobility demonstration ("demonstration") authorized by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019. Through that Implementation Notice, HUD made available up to $50,000,000 to participating Public Housing Agencies ("PHAs") to implement housing mobility programs. On April 30, 2021, HUD announced its selection of PHAs that will participate in the demonstration. These PHAs will receive $45.7 million in total funding under that award. This notice supplements the July 15, 2020, notice to describe additional policies and flexibilities for PHAs selected to participate in the demonstration.
