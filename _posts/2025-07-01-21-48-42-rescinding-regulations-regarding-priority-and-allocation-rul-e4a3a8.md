## Summary

MARAD is rescinding four obsolete parts in its regulations pertaining to procedures for assigning priority use of commercial shipping services and port facilities, vessel allocation services, and port utilization under Title I of the Defense Production Act (DFA) of 1950. On October 1, 2012, the Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of the Secretary (OST) established the Department's Transportation Priorities and Allocation System (TPAS) in 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 33, which replaces the subject regulations in 46 CFR parts 340 and 345-347 regarding priority use and allocation of shipping services, restrictions on port utilization transfer or changes, the standard form of service agreements for ports, and the standard form of marine terminal contracts. Rescinding these regulations will improve clarity with respect to the implementation and administration of TPAS and recognize the centralization of TPAS within DOT its administration by OST.
