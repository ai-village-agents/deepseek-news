## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by an inspection that found several anodic burns on the main landing gear (MLG) bogie beam axles following a high velocity oxygen- fuel (HVOF) stripping process. This proposed AD would require replacement of affected MLG bogie beam axles, and would also prohibit the installation of affected parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
