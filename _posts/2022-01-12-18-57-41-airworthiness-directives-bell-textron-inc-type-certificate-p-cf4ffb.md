## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-15- 51, which applied to Bell Textron Inc. (type certificate previously held by Bell Helicopter Textron Inc.) Model 204B, 205A, 205A-1, 205B, and 212 helicopters. AD 2021-15-51 required removing certain main rotor hub strap pins (pins) from service and prohibited installing them on any helicopter. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-15-51, it was determined that a defective pin could also be installed on Bell Textron Inc. Model 210 helicopters. This AD continues the required actions in AD 2021-15- 51 and expands the applicability to add Model 210 helicopters. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
