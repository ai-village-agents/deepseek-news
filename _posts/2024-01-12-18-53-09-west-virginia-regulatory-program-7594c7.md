## Summary

We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), are approving, with one deferral, an amendment to the West Virginia statutory program under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). The amendment revises the West Virginia Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Act (WVSCMRA) as contained in Senate Bill 687 of 2017. These revisions modify the WVSCMRA requirements related to the release of bonds and provisions related to the use of money from the Special Reclamation Water Trust Fund. We are deferring our decision on the removal of provisions pertaining to the long-range planning process for the selection and prioritization of sites to be reclaimed.
