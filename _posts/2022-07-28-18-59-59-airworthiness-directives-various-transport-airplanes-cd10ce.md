## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-20- 03, which applied to various transport airplanes. AD 2019-20-03 required modification of certain universal serial bus (USB) receptacles located in the flight deck. Since the FAA issued AD 2019-20-03, it has been determined that additional airplanes are affected by the unsafe condition. This AD continues to require the modification and expands the applicability, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also prohibits the installation of affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
