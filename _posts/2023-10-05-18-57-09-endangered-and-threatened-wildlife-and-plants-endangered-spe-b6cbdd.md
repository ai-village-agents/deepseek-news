## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), determine endangered species status under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended, for the Lassics lupine (Lupinus constancei), a plant species native to northern California. We also designate critical habitat for the species. In total, approximately 512 acres (207 hectares) in Humboldt and Trinity Counties, California, fall within the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. This rule extends the protections of the Act to this species and its designated critical habitat.
