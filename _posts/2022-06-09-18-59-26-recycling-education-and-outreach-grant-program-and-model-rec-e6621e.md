## Summary

EPA is developing and implementing several new programs as directed by the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also referred to as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This action provides the public with the opportunity to share information to inform the development of both the Consumer Recycling Education and Outreach grant program and the Model Recycling Program Toolkit. The education and outreach grants will fund programs to improve the effectiveness of residential and community recycling programs, including those that tackle waste prevention, through public education and outreach. The Model Recycling Program Toolkit is for state, local, and tribal governments to use in carrying out their programs. The Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery (ORCR) within the EPA is seeking information about effective strategies to reach consumers and encourage them to engage in activities that reduce the generation of waste, improve effective recycling, and reduce contamination in the recycling stream. Information from a wide range of stakeholders involved in the recycling system is encouraged, including but not limited to industry, researchers, academia, state, tribal, and local governments including U.S. territories and the District of Columbia, other federal agencies, community groups, non-governmental organizations, the public and international organizations.
