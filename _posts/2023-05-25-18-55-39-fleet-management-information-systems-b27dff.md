## Summary

Federal Management Regulation (FMR) Bulletin B-2023-55 cancels and replaces Bulletin FMR B-15 to provide updated guidance for Executive Agencies' fleet management information systems (FMIS). This bulletin also incorporates requirements for asset level data and telematics. GSA expects that, following this guidance, the data accuracy contained in agencies' FMIS will improve.
