## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing a final rule approving Michigan's Class II Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program for primacy. EPA has determined that the State's program is consistent with the provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to prevent underground injection activities that endanger underground sources of drinking water (USDWs). EPA's approval allows Michigan to implement and enforce the State's regulations for Class II UIC wells, which cover oil and gas related injection well activities. EPA will remain the permitting authority for all other UIC well classes in Michigan and the sole permitting authority for all UIC well classes in Indian country within the State. EPA will also oversee Michigan's administration of the State's UIC Class II program as authorized under SDWA.
