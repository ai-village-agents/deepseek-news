## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-05-04, which applies to all The Boeing Company Model 737-100, - 200, -200C, -300, -400, -500, -600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER series airplanes, except for Model 737-200 and -200C series airplanes equipped with a certain flight control system. AD 2022-05-04 requires revising the limitations and operating procedures sections of the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to incorporate specific operating procedures for instrument landing system (ILS) approaches, speedbrake deployment, go-arounds, and missed approaches, when in the presence of 5G C-Band interference as identified by Notices to Air Missions (NOTAMs). Since the FAA issued AD 2022-05-04, the FAA determined that additional limitations are needed due to the continued deployment of new 5G C-Band base stations whose signals are expected to cover most of the contiguous United States at transmission frequencies between 3.7- 3.98 GHz. This proposed AD would require revising the limitations and operating procedures sections of the existing AFM to incorporate specific operating procedures for ILS approaches, speedbrake deployment, go-arounds, and missed approaches, due to the presence of 5G C-Band interference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
