## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing a reopening of the comment period for the proposed rule "Air Plan Approval; Nebraska; Lincoln-Lancaster County Health Department (LLCHD)" to provide an additional 30 days for public comment. This additional opportunity to submit comments is provided due to two comments the EPA received including one noting that the State submission was not provided in the docket to allow the reviewer the ability to fully evaluate EPA's proposed action. As a result, we are providing the State's submission in the docket and reopening the public comment period to afford stakeholders an opportunity to comment on the proposed SIP revision.
