## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 777 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a 5-inch crack on the right wing upper wing skin at a certain wing station. This proposed AD would require repetitive inspections for cracking of the upper wing skin common to certain fasteners and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
