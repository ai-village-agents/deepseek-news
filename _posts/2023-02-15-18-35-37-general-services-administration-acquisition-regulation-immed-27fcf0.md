## Summary

The General Services Administration is issuing this technical amendment to amend the General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation (GSAR) to make a needed technical amendment. In error, the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) was not fully updated as a result of the amendment. Therefore, this correcting amendment is issued in order to update the CFR to include the amendatory language not included as originally intended at time of publication of the interim rule (GSAR 2021-G527).
