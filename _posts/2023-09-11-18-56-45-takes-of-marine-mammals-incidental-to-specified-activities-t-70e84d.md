## Summary

NMFS received a request from Orsted Wind Power North America LLC (Orsted) for the renewal of their 2022 incidental harassment authorization (IHA) (hereinafter, the 2022 IHA is referred to as the "initial IHA" and the requested IHA is referred to as the "Renewal IHA") to take marine mammals incidental to marine site characterization surveys, using high-resolution geophysical (HRG) equipment, in coastal waters from New York to Massachusetts, including the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) Commercial Lease of Submerged Lands for Renewable Energy Development on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lease Areas OCS-A 0486, 0487, 0500 and along potential export cable routes (ECR). The activities are identical to those covered under the initial IHA, which expires on October 5, 2023. Pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), prior to issuing the initial IHA, NMFS requested comments on both the proposed IHA and the potential for renewing the initial authorization if certain requirements were satisfied. The renewal requirements have been satisfied, and NMFS is now providing an additional 15-day comment period to allow for any additional comments on the proposed renewal not previously provided during the initial 30-day comment period. If issued, the renewal IHA would be effective from the date of issuance.
