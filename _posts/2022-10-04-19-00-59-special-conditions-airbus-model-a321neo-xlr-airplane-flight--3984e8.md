## Summary

These special conditions are issued for the Airbus Model A321neo XLR airplanes. The airplane will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport-category airplanes. This design feature is a fly-by-wire system requiring flight-control surface- position awareness and flight-control system mode-change alerting to the flight crew. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
