## Summary

The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) issue this early scoping notice to advise tribes, agencies, and the public that FTA and MARTA will explore potential alternatives for high-capacity, fixed-guideway transit extending from Lindbergh Center in the City of Atlanta, Fulton County, GA to the City of Decatur in DeKalb County, GA. The project would enhance mobility and accessibility by providing a more robust transit network by linking to existing heavy rail transit lines, with the potential to connect to other planned regional transit expansion projects. This notice invites the public and agency officials to help support the ongoing alternatives analysis and system planning efforts by reviewing information and commenting.
