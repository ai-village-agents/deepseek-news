## Summary

Phase 1 of the Deep Space Food Challenge is open, and teams that wish to compete may now register. Centennial Challenges, part of the NASA Space Technology Mission Directorate's Prizes, Challenges, and Crowdsourcing Program, consist of prize competitions to stimulate innovation in technologies of interest and value to NASA and the nation. Phase 1 of the Deep Space Food Challenge is a prize competition with a total prize purse made up of $500,000 USD, (five hundred thousand United States dollars) to be awarded to competitor teams for the design of novel technologies, systems and approaches for food production for long duration space exploration missions. NASA is providing the prize purse for U.S. teams, and the Methuselah Foundation will be conducting the Challenge on behalf of NASA. NASA is considering a Phase 2 (system demonstration phase) of the competition depending on the outcome of the Phase 1 competition.
