## Summary

This Final Sale Notice (FSN) contains information pertaining to the areas available for commercial wind energy leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Specifically, this FSN details certain provisions and conditions of the leases, auction details, the lease form, criteria for evaluating competing bids, and procedures for award, appeal, and lease execution. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) will offer three leases for sale using a multiple-factor bidding auction format: Lease OCS-G 37334, Lease OCS- G37335, and Lease OCS-G37336 (Lease Areas). The issuance of any lease resulting from this sale will not constitute approval of project- specific plans to develop offshore wind energy. Such plans, if submitted by the Lessee, will be subject to environmental, technical, and public reviews prior to a BOEM decision on whether the proposed activity should be authorized.
