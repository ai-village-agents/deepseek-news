## Summary

FAA is revising its regulations to implement certain flight restrictions in the airspace over the Potomac River near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) permanently. These revisions are necessary to mitigate the potential for midair collisions resulting from insufficient separation between fixed-wing aircraft operating to or from DCA and helicopters or powered-lift operating in the vertical- lift flight mode near DCA. The revisions will also fully implement a National Transportation Safety Board safety recommendation. The flight restrictions will prohibit helicopters and powered-lift operating in the vertical-lift flight mode from operating in a designated area near DCA unless these aircraft are conducting an essential operation.
