## Summary

Due to a technical problem with the docket that prevented comments from being accepted during part of the initial comment period, FNS is reopening the comment period for the interim final rule that appeared in the Federal Register on June 6, 2025. The rule rescinds an unnecessary reporting requirement for the school meals application verification process.
