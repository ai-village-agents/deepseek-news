## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for certain waters of the Potomac River. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters near Washington, DC, during a fireworks display on February 18, 2023. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Maryland- National Capital Region or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
