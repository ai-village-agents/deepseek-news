## Summary

The Coast Guard is amending the anchorage regulations for Los Angeles and Long Beach Harbors. This action would amend Anchorages F and G, and update anchorage usage and communication requirements. The purpose of this final rule is to improve navigation safety by modifying Anchorage F and G to accommodate an increased volume of vessel traffic and larger vessels calling on the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach and alleviate vessels anchoring near a subsea pipeline.
