## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is planning to submit an information collection request (ICR), "Information Collection Request for Lead and Copper Rule Revisions (LCRR)" (EPA ICR No. 2606.03, OMB Control No. 2040-0297) to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act . Before doing so, EPA is soliciting public comments on specific aspects of the proposed information collection as described below. This is a proposed extension of the LCRR ICR with additional information on the potential burden that may result from respondents (public water systems, primacy agencies, and EPA) consulting EPA's recommendations in "Guidance for Developing and Maintaining a Service Line Inventory" (August 2022, EPA 816-B-22-001) (referred to as Service Line (SL) Inventory Guidance) when seeking to comply with the requirements of the LCRR. An Agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. While this ICR covers a period of time following the LCRR compliance date, October 16, 2024, EPA intends to revise many parts of the LCRR through the Lead and Copper Rule Improvements (LCRI) prior to that compliance date. EPA intends to promulgate LCRI by October 16, 2024. EPA intends to issue an ICR that would revise the information collection to reflect the requirements under LCRI when it proposes and promulgates the LCRI.
