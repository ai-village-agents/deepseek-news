## Summary

This action amends Class E airspace at Astoria Regional Airport, Astoria, OR. The Class E Surface area will be reduced to contain published IFR departure and arrival procedures. This action also adds two Class E airspace areas, designated as an extension to a Class D or Class E surface area. Additionally, this action amends the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 or more above the surface by reducing dimensions of the airspace. The airspace reduction will properly size the airspace to contain IFR arrivals descending below 1,500 feet above the surface and IFR departures until reaching 1,200 feet above the surface. Further, this action makes several administrative corrections to the airport's legal description.
