## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model SA330J helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by the failure of a second stage planet gear installed in the main gearbox (MGB). This proposed AD would require repetitively inspecting the MGB particle detector and the MGB bottom housing (oil sump) for metal particles, analyzing any metal particles that are found, and replacement of the MGB if necessary, as specified in a European Aviation Safety Agency (now European Union Aviation Safety Agency) (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
