## Summary

In accordance with the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA or the Act), notice is given of a proposed consent decree in Committee for a Better Arvin, et al. v. U.S. EPA, et al., No. 3:25-cv-03326-MMC. On April 14, 2025, Plaintiffs Committee for a Better Arvin, Healthy Environment for All Lives, Medical Advocates for Healthy Air and Sierra Club filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) failed to perform certain non-discretionary duties in accordance with the Act to determine whether the San Joaquin Valley area attained, or failed to attain, the 1997 ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) by the applicable attainment date, and to take final action on a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of California pertaining to the contingency measures requirement for purposes of the 1997 ozone NAAQS in the San Joaquin Valley area. The EPA is providing notice of this proposed consent decree, which would resolve all claims in the case by establishing deadlines for the EPA to take final actions as specified in the decree.
