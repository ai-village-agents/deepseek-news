## Summary

The Corps of Engineers is establishing a restricted area in the waters of the Elizabeth River surrounding the Naval Station Norfolk (NSN) Lambert's Point Deperming Station in Norfolk, Virginia. Naval Station Norfolk is the home port of numerous ships and its facilities provide operational readiness support to the U.S. Atlantic Fleet. The deperming station is located within the waters of the Elizabeth River and it provides magnetic silencing services for military vessels. This deperming station is the only location capable of servicing an aircraft carrier and the only deperming facility on the east coast of the United States. The restricted area is necessary to protect underwater equipment, personnel, and vessels utilizing the facility by implementing a waterside security program. The regulation establishes the restricted area in waters surrounding the existing facility immediately adjacent to the channel into Norfolk Harbor.
