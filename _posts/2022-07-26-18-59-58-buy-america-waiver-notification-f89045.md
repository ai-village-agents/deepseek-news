## Summary

This notice provides information regarding the finding of the Maritime Administration (MARAD), in coordination with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), that it is appropriate to grant a Buy America waiver based on nonavailability to the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority (PhilaPort) for procurement of foreign iron and steel components for the Packer Avenue Marine Terminal (PAMT) Capacity and Warehouse Relocation FY2017-2018 Infrastructure for Rebuilding America (INFRA) project. The foreign iron and steel components are part of a Medium Voltage (MV) Cable Reel System, which is necessary for the conversion of two ship-to-shore (STS) cranes' drive power supply from diesel to electric. The non-domestic parts include: (i) Drive Gearbox and Motors; (ii) Electrical and Communications Collector System; (iii) MV cable drum; (iv) MV cable guides and diverter mounted to STS structure/legs; and (v) Gantry level bi-directional multi-roller, curved cable guide.
