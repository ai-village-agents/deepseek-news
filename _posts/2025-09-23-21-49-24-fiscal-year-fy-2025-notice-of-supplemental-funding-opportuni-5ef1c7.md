## Summary

This notice is to inform the public that the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is supporting administrative supplements (in the scope of the parent award) for the 60 eligible grant recipients funded in FY 2025 under the Substance Use Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery Services Block Grant (SUBG). Recipients may receive an amount from $25,000 to approximately $2,400,000 for a total funding amount of $18,000,000. These recipients have a project end date of September 30, 2026.
