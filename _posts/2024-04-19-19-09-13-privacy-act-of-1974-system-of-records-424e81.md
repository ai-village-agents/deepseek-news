## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission or Agency) is modifying a system of records, FCC/WCB-3, Affordable Connectivity Program, subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. This action is necessary to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act to publish in the Federal Register notice of the existence and character of records maintained by the agency. The Affordable Connectivity Program ("ACP"), the successor to the Commission's Emergency Broadband Benefit Program, provides discounts for broadband internet access service ("BIAS") to qualifying households. A household may qualify for the ACP if an individual in the household has applied for and has been approved to receive benefits under the free and reduced price lunch program, receives assistance through the special supplemental nutritional program for women, infants, and children ("WIC"), receives a Pell Grant, qualifies for the Lifeline program, meets certain income requirements, or qualifies for a low-income program offered by internet service providers. The ACP is administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) under the direction of the Commission and, by delegation, of the Commission's Wireline Competition Bureau (WCB). This system of records contains information about individual ACP applicants and participants, providers' claims and certifying officers, and providers' enrollment representatives.
