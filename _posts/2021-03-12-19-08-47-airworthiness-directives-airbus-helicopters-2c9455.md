## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-15- 02, which applied to certain Airbus Helicopters Model AS350B, AS350B1, AS350B2, AS350B3, AS350BA, AS355E, AS355F, AS355F1, AS355F2, AS355N, and AS355NP helicopters. AD 2018-15-02 required repetitively inspecting the tail rotor (TR) pitch rod for a damaged elastomeric ball joint, and corrective action if necessary. This AD continues to require the repetitive inspections and allows the repetitive inspection interval to be extended under certain conditions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD was prompted by a report of several cases of damaged TR pitch rod ball joints. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
