## Summary

The Department of Labor (the Department), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, conducts a preclearance consultation program to provide the general public and Federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on proposed and continuing collections of information in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA 95). This program helps to ensure that the data the Department collects can be provided in the desired format, that the reporting burden on the public (time and financial resources) is minimized, that the public understands the Department's collection instruments, and that the Department can accurately assess the impact of its collection requirements on respondents. Currently, the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) is soliciting comments concerning a revision to the information collection contained in the National Medical Support Notice--Part B. A copy of the ICRs may be obtained by contacting the office listed in the ADDRESSES section of this notice.
