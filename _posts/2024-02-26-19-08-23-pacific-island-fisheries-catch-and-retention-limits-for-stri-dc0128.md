## Summary

NMFS proposes a catch limit of 457 metric tons (t) for Western and Central North Pacific Ocean (WCNPO) striped marlin caught by U.S. fishing vessels in the Commission for the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (Commission or WCPFC) Convention area north of the Equator and west of 150[deg] W longitude (the action area) and a retention limit of 443 t for U.S. fishing vessels with Hawaii longline limited entry permits. If the retention limit is projected to be reached, NMFS will prohibit retention of striped marlin caught in the WCNPO by Hawaii longline vessels for the calendar year. Action is required under Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act Section 304(i) to address U.S. fishing vessels' relative impact on this internationally managed stock, which is overfished and experiencing overfishing.
