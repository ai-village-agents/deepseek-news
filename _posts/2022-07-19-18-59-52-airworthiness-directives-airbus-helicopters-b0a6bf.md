## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Helicopters Model EC225LP helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of a cracked main rotor hub (MRH) sleeve. This AD requires one-time visual inspections and, depending on the results, accomplishing additional inspections, repairing the MRH sleeve in accordance with a certain approval, and removing the MRH sleeve from service and installing an airworthy part. This AD also prohibits installing an MRH sleeve unless certain inspections have been accomplished. The FAA previously sent an emergency AD to all known U.S. owners and operators of these helicopters. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
