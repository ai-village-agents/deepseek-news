## Summary

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) seeks approval to collect new information to use in testing measures of the implementation and costs of high-quality early care and education as part of the project, Assessing the Implementation and Cost of High-Quality Early Care and Education (ECE-ICHQ). The study received approval for a field test to validate and improve the psychometric properties of these measures in November 2019. This request is to add a measure to the approved field test to help further assess the associations between measures of implementation, cost, and quality.
