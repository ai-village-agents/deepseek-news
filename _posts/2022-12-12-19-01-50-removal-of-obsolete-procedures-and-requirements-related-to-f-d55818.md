## Summary

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is amending its regulations to update information that is no longer accurate since the creation of the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). DHS is updating obsolete or unnecessary information because SEVIS, a Web-based system that DHS uses to collect and maintain current and ongoing information on Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)- certified schools, F-1 and M-1 nonimmigrant students, and J-1 Exchange Visitor Program participants and their sponsors, has replaced older paper-based processes. In addition, DHS is making technical changes to correct typographical errors, update references and citations, and make other needed changes to reflect the transfer of responsibilities to DHS from the Department of Justice (DOJ). Further, this rule removes language requiring original signatures on Form I-17, Petition for Approval of School for Attendance by Nonimmigrant Student or successor form, and clarifies language about the requirement of an original signature on Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status or successor form. This rulemaking introduces no substantive changes, does not raise existing costs; and places no additional burden on F, J, and M nonimmigrants, or on sponsoring academic institutions and programs.
