## Summary

The Administrator of the World Trade Center (WTC) Health Program received four petitions (Petitions 031, 036, 039, and 053) to add amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) to the List of WTC-Related Health Conditions (List). Upon reviewing the scientific and medical literature, including information provided by petitioners, the Administrator determined that there is insufficient evidence to support taking further action at this time regarding ALS. The Administrator also finds that insufficient evidence exists to request a recommendation of the WTC Health Program Scientific/Technical Advisory Committee (STAC), to publish a proposed rule, or to publish a determination not to publish a proposed rule.
