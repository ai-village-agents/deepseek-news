## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain General Electric Company (GE) Model GE90-110B1 and GE90-115B engines. This AD was prompted by a report of an aborted takeoff due to left engine failure caused by liberation of the interstage high- pressure turbine (HPT) rotor seal rim. This AD requires repetitive ultrasonic inspections (USIs) of the interstage HPT rotor seal for cracks and removal from service if necessary. As a mandatory terminating action to the repetitive USIs of the interstage HPT rotor seal, this AD also requires replacement of the interstage HPT rotor seal. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
