## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class D and Class E airspace at Sioux Gateway Airport/Brigadier General Bud Day Field, Sioux City, IA. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of an airspace review caused by the decommissioning of the Sioux City VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) navigation aid as part of the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program. The name and geographic coordinates of the airport would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
