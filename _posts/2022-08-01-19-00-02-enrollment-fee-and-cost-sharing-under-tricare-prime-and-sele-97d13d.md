## Summary

This interim final rule (IFR) accompanies the in-progress implementation of section 702 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (NDAA-2020) as an administrative measure not intended to affect or grant rights. The law mandates that retirees and their dependents pay TRICARE premiums via allotment from military retired/retainer pay to the maximum extent practicable instead of credit card or electronic funds transfer (EFT), applicable to health care coverage beginning on or after January 1, 2021. In conforming the regulation to the mandatory statutory changes, this IFR improves TRICARE by reflecting the simplification and automation of premium fee collection.
