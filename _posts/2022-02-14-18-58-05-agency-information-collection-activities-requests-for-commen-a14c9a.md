## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves the submission of an application to obtain a Letter of Deviation Authority to permit flight instruction for compensation or hire aboard experimental category aircraft under 14 CFR 91.319. The information to be collected will be used to determine whether such flight instruction can be conducted safely.
