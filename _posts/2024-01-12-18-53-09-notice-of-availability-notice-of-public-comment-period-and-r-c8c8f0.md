## Summary

This Environmental Assessment (EA) has been prepared to satisfy National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requirements (authorization to operate at supersonic speeds). This EA addresses the environmental impacts of proposed supersonic operations within the pre- existing supersonic corridors, as well as the effects of the associated landing and takeoff (LTO) operations at Mojave Air and Space Port. The proposed supersonic flight operations evaluated in this EA would consist of a limited number of test flights (10-20 supersonic tests of the XB-1 and its chase aircraft) occurring within a one-year duration.
