## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to grant an exemption from the commercial driver's license (CDL) regulations to Teupen North America, Inc. (Teupen) for one driver, Mr. Martin Borutta, Lead Engineer for Teupen. Mr. Borutta holds a valid German commercial license and wants to test drive Teupen's new aerial lift design vehicle on U.S. roads to better understand product requirements for safe application in the U.S. market, and verify results. FMCSA believes that the requirements for a German commercial license ensure that operations under the exemption would likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to or greater than the level that would be obtained in the absence of the exemption.
