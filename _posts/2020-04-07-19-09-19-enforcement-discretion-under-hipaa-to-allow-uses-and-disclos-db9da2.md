## Summary

This notification is to inform the public that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is exercising its discretion in how it applies the Privacy Rule under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Current regulations allow a HIPAA business associate to use and disclose protected health information for public health and health oversight purposes only if expressly permitted by its business associate agreement with a HIPAA covered entity. As a matter of enforcement discretion, effective immediately, the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) will exercise its enforcement discretion and will not impose potential penalties for violations of certain provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule against covered health care providers or their business associates for uses and disclosures of protected health information by business associates for public health and health oversight activities during the COVID-19 nationwide public health emergency.
