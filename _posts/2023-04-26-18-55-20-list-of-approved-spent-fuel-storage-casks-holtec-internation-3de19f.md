## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is delaying the effective date of a direct final rule published in the Federal Register on February 13, 2023. The direct final rule renews the initial certificate (Amendment 0) and Amendment Nos. 1 through 15 of the Holtec International HI-STORM 100 Certificate of Compliance No. 1014 for 40 years and revises the certificate of compliance's conditions and technical specifications to address aging management activities related to the structures, systems, and components important to safety of the dry storage system to ensure that these will maintain their intended functions during the period of extended storage operations. The delay is necessary for the NRC to evaluate the public comments submitted on the direct final rule.
