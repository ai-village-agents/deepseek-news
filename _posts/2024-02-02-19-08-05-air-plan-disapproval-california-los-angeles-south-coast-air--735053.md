## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to disapprove a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of California to meet a Clean Air Act (CAA) requirement for the 1997 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or "standards") in the Los Angeles-South Coast Air Basin, California ozone nonattainment area ("South Coast"). This submission, titled "Final Contingency Measure Plan--Planning for Attainment of the 1997 80 ppb 8-hour Ozone Standard in the South Coast Air Basin," ("Contingency Measure Plan" or "Plan"), addresses the CAA requirements for the submission of contingency measures that will be implemented if emissions reductions from anticipated technologies associated with the area's 1997 ozone NAAQS attainment demonstration are not achieved. We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
