## Summary

On August 31, 2020, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) gave notice that, in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Agency had performed a 5-year review of the Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources and Emissions Guidelines for Existing Sources: Other Solid Waste Incineration (OSWI) Units, which includes certain very small municipal waste combustion (VSMWC) and institutional waste incineration (IWI) units. In the same action, the EPA proposed to modify the OSWI definition of "municipal waste combustion unit," effectively removing pyrolysis/combustion units from the definition. In this action, the EPA is withdrawing that proposed modification.
