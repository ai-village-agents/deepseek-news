## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has submitted an information collection request (ICR), Safer Choice Program Product and Partner Recognition Activities, (EPA ICR Number 2692.01, OMB Control Number 2070-NEW) to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act. This is a request to renew and combine the approval of two existing ICRs (2070-0178 and 2070-0189) that are currently approved through May 31, 2022, and November 30, 2022, respectively. Public comments were previously requested via the Federal Register on June 28, 2021, during a 60-day comment period. This notice allows for an additional 30 days for public comments. A fuller description of the ICR is given below, including its estimated burden and cost to the public. An agency may not conduct or sponsor and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
