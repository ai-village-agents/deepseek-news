Commerce preliminarily determined that [Ouml]zdemir Boru Profil Sanayi ve Ticaret Anonim Sirketi (Ozdemir A.S.) is the successor-in-interest to [Ouml]zdemir Boru Profil Sanayi ve Ticaret Limited Sirketi (Ozdemir LLC) and, as a result, should be accorded the same CVD cash deposit treatment as Ozdemir LLC with respect to subject merchandise.
