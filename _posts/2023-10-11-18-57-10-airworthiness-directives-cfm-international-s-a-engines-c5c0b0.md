## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain CFM International, S.A. (CFM) Model LEAP-1A23, LEAP-1A24, LEAP-1A24E1, LEAP-1A26, LEAP-1A26CJ, LEAP-1A26E1, LEAP-1A29, LEAP- 1A29CJ, LEAP-1A30, LEAP-1A32, LEAP-1A33, LEAP-1A33B2, and LEAP-1A35A engines. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of multiple aborted takeoffs and air turn-backs (ATBs) caused by high-pressure compressor (HPC) stall, which was induced by high levels of non-synchronous vibration (NSV). Additional manufacturer investigation revealed that wear on the No. 3 bearing spring finger housing can lead to high levels of NSV. This proposed AD would require initial and repetitive calculations of the levels of NSV, inspection of the stage 2 high- pressure turbine (HPT) nozzle assembly honeycomb and HPT stator stationary seal honeycomb and, depending on the results of the calculations and inspections, replacement of certain parts. This proposed AD would also require replacement of the No. 3 bearing spring finger housing. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
