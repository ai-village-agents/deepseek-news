## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for certain waters of the Menominee River in Marinette, WI within 1000 feet of a blasting area. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters during the daily blasting at the southern bank of the Menominee River near the Fincantieri Marinette Marine facility. This proposed rulemaking would restrict usage by persons and vessels within the safety zone. At no time during the effective period may vessels or person pass between the construction barges and southern bank of Menominee River. Also during the entire effective period, vessels are prohibit from transiting the safety zone at speeds that would create a wake. Additionally, during blasting operations, lasting approximately 15 minutes each evening, no person or vessel may enter the safety zone. These restrictions would apply to all vessels during the effective period unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Lake Michigan or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
