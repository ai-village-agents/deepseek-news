## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) directs certain fixed and mobile Broadcast Auxiliary Services (BAS) and Cable Television Relay Services (CARS) licensees authorized to use the 12.7-13.25 GHz (12.7 GHz) band to certify the accuracy of the information reflected on their licenses, including whether their facilities are operating as authorized. If a licensee is unable to make such a certification for a given license, it must cancel or modify the license in accordance with the Commission's rules. The Order is intended to improve the data that the public and the Commission have to make informed comments and decisions about the proposals discussed in the concurrent notice of proposed rulemaking, published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, in which the Commission proposes to protect only those 12.7 GHz BAS and CARS stations for which the licensee timely files the certification required in this Order. A subsequent public notice will provide detailed filing instructions and establish a window for the filing of certifications.
