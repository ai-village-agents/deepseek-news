## Summary

As a result of the determinations by the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that revocation of the countervailing duty (CVD) orders on certain cold-rolled steel flat products (cold-rolled steel or CRS) from the People's Republic of China (China) and the Republic of Korea (Korea) would likely lead to continuation or recurrence of net countervailable subsidies and material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation of the CVD orders.
