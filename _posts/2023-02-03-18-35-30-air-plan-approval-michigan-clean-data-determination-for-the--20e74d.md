## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to determine under the Clean Air Act (CAA) that the Detroit, Michigan nonattainment area (hereafter also referred to, respectively, as the "Detroit area" or "area") has attained the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS or standard). This determination is based upon complete, quality-assured, and certified ambient air monitoring data for the 2020-2022 design period showing that the area achieved attainment of the 2015 ozone NAAQS. EPA also proposes to take final agency action on an exceptional events request submitted by the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) on January 26, 2023, and concurred on by EPA on January 30, 2023. As a result of these determinations, EPA is proposing to suspend the requirements for the area to submit attainment demonstrations and associated Reasonably Available Control Measures (RACM), Reasonable Further Progress (RFP) plans, contingency measures for failure to attain or make reasonable progress, and other planning State Implementation Plans (SIPs) related to attainment of the 2015 ozone NAAQS, for as long as the area continues to attain the 2015 ozone NAAQS. This action does not constitute a redesignation of the area to attainment of the 2015 ozone NAAQS, and the area remains designated nonattainment until such time as EPA determines that the area meets the CAA requirements for redesignation to attainment and takes action to redesignate the area.
