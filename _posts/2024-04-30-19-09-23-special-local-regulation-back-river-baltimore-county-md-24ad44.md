## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish special local regulations to provide for the safety of life on certain waters of the Back River, in Baltimore County, MD. These regulations would be enforced during a high-speed power boat event and air show which will be held annually, on the 2nd, 3rd or 4th weekend (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) in July. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the regulated area unless authorized by the Captain of the Port, Maryland-National Capital Region, or the Coast Guard Event Patrol Commander. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
