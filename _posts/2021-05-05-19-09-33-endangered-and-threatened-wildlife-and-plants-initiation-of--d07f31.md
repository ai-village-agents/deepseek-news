## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, are conducting 5-year status reviews under the Endangered Species Act of 23 animal and plant species. A 5-year status review is based on the best scientific and commercial data available at the time of the review; therefore, we are requesting submission of any such information that has become available since the last review for the species.
