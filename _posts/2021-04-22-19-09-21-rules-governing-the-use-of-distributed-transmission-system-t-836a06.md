# Rules Governing the Use of Distributed Transmission System Technologies, Authorizing Permissive Use of the “Next Generation” Broadcast Television Standard

## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission modifies its rules governing the use of distributed transmission system (DTS) technologies by broadcast television stations by permitting, within certain limits, DTS signals to spill over beyond a station's authorized service area by more than the "minimal amount" currently allowed. By affording broadcasters greater flexibility in the placement of DTS transmitters, the rule changes allow broadcasters to enhance their signal capabilities and fill coverage gaps, improve indoor and mobile reception, and increase spectrum efficiency by reducing the need for television translator stations operating on separate channels.
