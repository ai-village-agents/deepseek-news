## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a permitting rule submitted as a revision to the Placer County Air Pollution Control District (PCAPCD or "District") portion of the California state implementation plan (SIP). This revision concerns the District's Nonattainment New Source Review permitting program for new and modified major stationary sources of air pollution in nonattainment areas under part D of title I of the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act"). We are approving a local rule that has been revised to address deficiencies previously identified by the EPA in a prior action that included a limited approval and limited disapproval of a prior version of the rule. This final action stops all sanction and Federal implementation plan clocks started by our September 26, 2023 limited approval and limited disapproval and deferred by our April 2, 2025 interim final determination.
