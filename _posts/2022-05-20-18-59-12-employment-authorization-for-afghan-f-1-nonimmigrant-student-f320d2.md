## Summary

This notice announces that the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) is suspending certain regulatory requirements for F-1 nonimmigrant students whose country of citizenship is Afghanistan, regardless of country of birth (or individuals having no nationality who last habitually resided in Afghanistan), and who are experiencing severe economic hardship as a direct result of the current situation in Afghanistan. The Secretary is taking action to provide relief to these lawful F-1 nonimmigrant students so the students may request employment authorization, work an increased number of hours while their academic institution is in session, and reduce their course load while continuing to maintain their F-1 nonimmigrant student status. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will deem an F-1 nonimmigrant student who receives employment authorization by means of this notice to be engaged in a "full course of study" for the duration of the employment authorization, if the nonimmigrant student satisfies the minimum course load requirement described in this notice.
