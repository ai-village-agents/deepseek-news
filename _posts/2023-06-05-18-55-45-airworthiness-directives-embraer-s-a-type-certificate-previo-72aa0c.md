## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Embraer S.A. Model ERJ 190-300 and ERJ 190-400 airplanes. This AD was prompted by the excessive operation of certain elevator and rudder surfaces during manufacturing, causing damage and accelerating wear of internal parts of the power control units (PCUs). This AD requires replacement of the left-hand (LH) and right-hand (RH) elevator PCUs and lower and upper rudder PCUs, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
