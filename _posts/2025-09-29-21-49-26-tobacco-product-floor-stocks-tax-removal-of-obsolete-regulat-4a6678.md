## Summary

In this final rule, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) is removing regulations related to the 2009 tobacco product floor stocks tax. These regulations are no longer necessary because they implement a tax that applied only to specified articles held for sale on April 1, 2009, and was required to be paid on or before August 1, 2009. This deregulatory action removes 42 regulatory sections from TTB regulations.
