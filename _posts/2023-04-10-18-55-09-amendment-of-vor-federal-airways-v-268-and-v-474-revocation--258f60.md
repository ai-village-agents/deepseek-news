## Summary

This action corrects a final rule published by the FAA in the Federal Register on March 27, 2023, that amended Very High Frequency (VHF) Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-268 and V-474, revoked Jet Route J-518 and VOR Federal airway V-119, and established Area Navigation (RNAV) route Q-178. In the final rule, one of the two categorical exclusion references listed in the Environmental Review section of the preamble was incorrect. The final rule Environmental Review section referenced categorical exclusions pursuant to FAA Order 1050.1F, Environmental Impacts: Policies and Procedures, paragraphs 5- 6.5a and 5-6.5k, in error. The correct categorical exclusion references are FAA Order 1050.1F, paragraphs 5-6.5a and 5-6.5i. This action corrects that error.
