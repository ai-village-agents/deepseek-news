## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves the noise certification regulations for aircraft. This includes information collection requirements for the noise certification of subsonic aircraft--jet airplanes and subsonic transport category large airplanes, small propeller driven airplanes and rotorcraft. The information collected are the results of noise certification tests that demonstrate compliance. The original information collection was implemented to show compliance in accordance with the Aircraft Noise Abatement Act of 1968; that statute is now part of the overall codification of the FAA's regulatory authority over aircraft noise. The noise compliance report is used by the FAA in making a finding that the airplane is in noise compliance with the regulations. These compliance reports are required only once when an applicant wants to certificate an aircraft type. Without this data collection, the FAA would be unable to make the required noise certification compliance finding.
