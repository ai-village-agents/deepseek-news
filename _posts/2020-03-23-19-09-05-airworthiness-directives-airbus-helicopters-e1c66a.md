## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Helicopters Model AS350B2 helicopters. This proposed AD would require performing a test of the main rotor RPM (NR) indicator, and depending on the results, altering the wiring. This proposed AD is prompted by reports of some NR indicators displaying incorrect information. The actions of this proposed AD are intended to address an unsafe condition on these products.
