## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or "Agency") is seeking public nominations of scientific and technical experts that EPA can consider for service as ad hoc reviewers assisting the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act Scientific Advisory Panel (FIFRA SAP) with the review of the Agency's reevaluation of 11 atrazine microcosm and mesocosm studies identified by the 2012 FIFRA SAP as warranting further review. EPA currently anticipates selecting approximately 8-12 ad hoc reviewers and plans to make a list of candidates under consideration as prospective ad hoc reviewers for this review available for public comment by late May 2023. EPA is also announcing that a virtual public meeting of the FIFRA SAP is being scheduled in August 2023. In July 2023, EPA plans to release the reevaluation document submitted to the FIFRA SAP for peer review, along with all background documents, related supporting materials and draft charge questions provided to the FIFRA SAP. At that time, EPA will publish a separate document in the Federal Register to announce the availability of and solicit public comment on the draft reevaluation document and provide instructions for submitting comments and registering to provide oral comments at the August 2023 meeting.
