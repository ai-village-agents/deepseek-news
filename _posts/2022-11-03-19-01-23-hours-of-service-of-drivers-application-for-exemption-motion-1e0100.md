## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to provisionally renew an exemption from the electronic logging device (ELD) requirements for all commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers providing transportation to or from a theatrical or television motion picture production site. The exemption requested by the Motion Picture Association (MPA), formerly known as the Motion Picture Association of America, allows these drivers to complete paper records of duty status (RODS) instead of using an ELD. The exemption renewal is for five years.
