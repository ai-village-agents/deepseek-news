## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), invite the public to comment on applications to conduct certain activities with foreign species that the Service has jurisdiction under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). With some exceptions, the MMPA prohibits activities with listed species unless Federal authorization is issued that allows such activities. The MMPA also requires that we invite public comment before issuing permits for any activity otherwise prohibited by the MMPA with respect to any endangered species or marine mammals.
