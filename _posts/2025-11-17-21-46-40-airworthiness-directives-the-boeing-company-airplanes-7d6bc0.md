## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 777-200, -200LR, -300, -300ER, and 777F series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of overheated alternating current motor pumps (ACMP) that caused a fire in the main landing gear (MLG) wheel well. This proposed AD would require a records check or inspection for any installed ACMP with a certain part number and applicable on-condition actions. This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
