## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A330-202, -203, -223, and -243 airplanes; Model A330-200 Freighter series airplanes; Model A330-300 series airplanes; Model A340-200 series airplanes; and Model A340-300 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that damage was found to the firewall and fuselage skin in the auxiliary power unit (APU) compartment area on Model A330 airplanes. This proposed AD would require replacing affected tee ducts with serviceable parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
