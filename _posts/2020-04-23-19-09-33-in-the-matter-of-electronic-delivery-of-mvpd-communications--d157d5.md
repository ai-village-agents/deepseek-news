## Summary

In this final rule document, we adopt proposals to modernize the Commission's carriage election notice rules with respect to certain television broadcast stations and open video systems (OVS) operators. First, we conclude that low power television stations (LPTVs) that qualify for mandatory carriage (qualified LPTVs) must send notices to affected multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs) by email when changing their carriage election status in the same manner as full power television broadcast stations. However, unlike the requirement for full power television broadcast stations, qualified LPTVs and noncommercial educational (NCE) television translator stations that qualify for must carry (qualified NCE translators) will not be required to make their carriage election statements available for public inspection. Second, we find that MVPDs with carriage-related questions should be able to rely on the contact information provided by qualified LPTV and qualified NCE translator stations in the Commission's Licensing and Management System (LMS) database. If an MVPD contacts the phone number or email address provided by the station regarding a concern about carriage, those concerns must be addressed as soon as is reasonably possible. Third, we conclude that, in the same manner as cable operators, OVS operators must post contact information for questions regarding carriage election to the Cable Operations and Licensing System (COALS) database, accept email election change notices, and timely respond to carriage-related questions. Through this Order, we continue our efforts to modernize our rules.
