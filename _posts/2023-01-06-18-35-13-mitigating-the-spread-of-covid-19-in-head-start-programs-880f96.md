## Summary

This final rule removes the requirement for universal masking for all individuals ages 2 and older. This final rule requires that Head Start programs have an evidence-based COVID-19 mitigation policy, developed in consultation with their Health Services Advisory Committee. This final rule does not address the vaccination and testing requirement, which is still under review. The vaccine requirement remains in effect.
