## Summary

The Corps of Engineers is proposing to establish three danger zones in the waters of Carr Creek and Whitehall Bay in the vicinity of the Naval Support Activity Annapolis. The establishment of the proposed danger zone in Carr Creek is necessary to enable safe operation of the United States Naval Academy firing range and to reflect the routine and periodic usage of the firing range for training sailors, midshipmen, and law enforcement personnel. The establishment of the two proposed danger zones in Whitehall Bay is necessary to enable the safe operation of the United States Naval Academy firing range and to reflect irregular and infrequent usage of the range for training sailors, midshipmen, and law enforcement personnel. The firing range faces Carr Creek and, during times of operation, may present a danger to vessels located in the areas of the proposed danger zones.
