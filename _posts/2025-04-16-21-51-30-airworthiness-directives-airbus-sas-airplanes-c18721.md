## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and - 233 airplanes; and Model A321-211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that cracks were found following fatigue tests for the new lower wing cover material on airplanes equipped with sharklets. This proposed AD would require repetitive inspections for discrepancies, and corrective action, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
