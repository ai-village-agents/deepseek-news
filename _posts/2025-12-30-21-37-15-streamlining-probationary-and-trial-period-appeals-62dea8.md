## Summary

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing a rule to change the circumstances and procedures for adjudicating appeals from employees covered by these provisions and terminated during their probationary or trial periods and supervisors and managers who fail to complete their probationary periods. This change follows the President's rescinding of the regulations at subpart H of part 315 of this chapter as directed by Executive Order 14284. As proposed, employees would file appeals limited to: discrimination based on partisan political reasons or marital status; and failure to follow procedures for terminations based upon pre-appointment reasons. OPM would replace the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) as the adjudicative agency for all appeals. Employees who wish to pursue claims of discrimination under statutes administered by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) would not be allowed to raise these claims with OPM.
