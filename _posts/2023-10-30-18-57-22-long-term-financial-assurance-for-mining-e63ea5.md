## Summary

The Forest Service is amending its locatable minerals rules to provide mine operators with a broader array of options for securing financial assurance for funding reclamation work. Locatable mineral operations on National Forest System lands must be conducted to minimize adverse environmental impacts on National Forest surface resources, which often includes reclamation at the conclusion of operations. Current regulations provide that the Forest Service may require the operator to furnish a "bond" to fund reclamation work. However, the financial assurance mechanisms are limited to surety bonds, cash, and negotiable securities. This rule will expand those options. It does not change requirements for surface resource and environmental protection. Rather, it provides additional options for obtaining the financial assurance necessary to be sure that those requirements will be met.
