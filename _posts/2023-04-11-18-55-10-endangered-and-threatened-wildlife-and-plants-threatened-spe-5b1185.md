## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), determine threatened species status under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended, for the bracted twistflower (Streptanthus bracteatus), a plant species from Texas. In addition, we designate critical habitat for the bracted twistflower. In total, approximately 1,596 acres (646 hectares) in Uvalde, Medina, Bexar, and Travis Counties, Texas, fall within the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. This rule applies the protections of the Act to this species and its designated critical habitat. We also finalize a rule issued under the authority of section 4(d) of the Act (a "4(d) rule") that provides measures that are necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation of this species.
