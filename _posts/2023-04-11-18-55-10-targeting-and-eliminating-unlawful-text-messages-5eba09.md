## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) requires mobile wireless providers to block texts, at the network level, on a reasonable Do-Not-Originate (DNO) list, which include numbers that purport to be from invalid, unallocated, or unused North American Numbering Plan (NANP) numbers, and NANP numbers for which the subscriber to the number has requested that texts purporting to originate from that number be blocked. In addition, the Commission requires mobile wireless providers and other entities to maintain a point of contact for texters to report erroneously blocked texts.
