## Summary

The Board and the FDIC (together, the agencies) are inviting comments on proposed guidance for the 2024 and subsequent resolution plan submissions by certain foreign banking organizations. The proposed guidance is meant to assist these firms in developing their resolution plans, which are required to be submitted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as amended (the Dodd- Frank Act), and the jointly issued implementing regulation (the Rule). The scope of application of the proposed guidance would be foreign- based triennial full filers (specified firms or firms), which are foreign-based Category II and III banking organizations, and the guidance, if finalized, would supersede the joint Guidance for Resolution Plan Submissions of Certain Foreign-Based Covered Companies (85 FR 83557 (Dec. 22, 2020) (2020 FBO Guidance)). The proposed guidance is based on the agencies' review of the specified firms' 2021 and prior resolution plan submissions, as well as the agencies' experiences dealing with stress events in the international and domestic banking systems, and would describe the agencies' expectations regarding several aspects of the specified firms' plans for an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The agencies invite public comment on all aspects of the proposed guidance.
