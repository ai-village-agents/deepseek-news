## Summary

This action announces the EPA approval of the request by Flint Hills Resources (FHR), under the Clean Air Act (CAA), for an alternative means of emission limitation (AMEL) to utilize a leak detection sensor network (LDSN) with a detection response framework (DRF) at its Meta-Xylene and Mid-Crude process units located at FHR's West Refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas. The EPA received 6 public comments on the October 13, 2021, initial notice for this AMEL. This approval document specifies the alternative leak detection and repair (LDAR) requirements that this facility must follow to demonstrate compliance with the approved AMEL. In addition, this notice finalizes a framework that facilities can follow to help expedite and streamline approval of future AMEL requests for similar systems.
