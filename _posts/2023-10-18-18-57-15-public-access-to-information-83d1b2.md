**Document Number:** 2023-22380

## Summary

The Department of State (the Department) finalizes the proposed rule it published on March 3, 2020, relating to the availability to the public of information that is under the control of the Department. These changes were prompted by changes in the law governing disclosure of such information, including the Freedom of Information Act Improvement Act of 2016. This final rule reflects changes in the FOIA and consequent changes in the Department's procedures since the last major revision of the Department's regulations on public access to information, which occurred in 2016.
