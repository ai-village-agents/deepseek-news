## Summary

This final rule amends the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards (the Construction and Safety Standards) by adopting recommendations made to HUD by the Manufactured Housing Consensus Committee (MHCC), as modified by HUD. The National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 (the Act) requires HUD to publish in the proposed revised Construction and Safety Standards submitted by the MHCC. The MHCC prepared and submitted to HUD its third group of recommendations to improve various aspects of the Construction and Safety Standards. HUD reviewed those recommendations and adopted some of them after making editorial revisions and some additions. This final rule further revises the Construction and Safety Standards based on HUD's review and incorporation of certain public comments.
