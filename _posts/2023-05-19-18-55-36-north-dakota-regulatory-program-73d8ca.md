## Summary

We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), are announcing receipt of a proposed amendment to the North Dakota regulatory program (hereinafter, the North Dakota program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). North Dakota proposes changes to the North Dakota Century Code made by the 67th Legislative Assembly in response to Senate Bill 2317, introduced by the Department of Trust Lands, and the resulting rule changes to the North Dakota Administrative Code for surface coal mining and reclamation operations. The changes add a perfected lien or security interest in real property to the definition of collateral bond and add the conditions that must be met for real property pledged as collateral bond. This document gives the times and locations that the North Dakota program and this proposed amendment to that program are available for your inspection, the comment period during which you may submit written comments on the amendment, and the procedures that we will follow for the public hearing, if one is requested.
