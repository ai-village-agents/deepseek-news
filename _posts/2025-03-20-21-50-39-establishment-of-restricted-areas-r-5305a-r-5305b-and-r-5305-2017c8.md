## Summary

This action proposes to establish restricted areas R-5305A, R- 5305B, and R-5305C; Camp Lejeune, NC; and restricted areas R-5307A, R- 5307B, and R-5307C; Cherry Point, NC. The purpose of this proposal is to create additional restricted area airspace to connect restricted area R-5003, R-5004, and R-5306 complexes to contain hazardous activities such as weapon deployment, non-eye safe lasers, and artillery within larger contiguous restricted area airspace that is required to realistically simulate essential training mission tasks.
