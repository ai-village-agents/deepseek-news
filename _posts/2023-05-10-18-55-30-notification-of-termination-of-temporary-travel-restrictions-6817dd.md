## Summary

This Notification announces the decision of the Secretary of Homeland Security ("Secretary"), after consulting with interagency partners, to terminate temporary restrictions on travel by certain noncitizens into the United States at land ports of entry ("land POEs"), including ferry terminals, along the United States-Mexico border. Under the latest (April 22, 2022) notice of the temporary restrictions, which applied only to noncitizens who are neither U.S. nationals nor lawful permanent residents ("noncitizen non-LPRs"), DHS allowed the processing for entry into the United States of only those noncitizen non-LPRs who were fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and could provide proof of being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 upon request at arrival. DHS is terminating these restrictions.
