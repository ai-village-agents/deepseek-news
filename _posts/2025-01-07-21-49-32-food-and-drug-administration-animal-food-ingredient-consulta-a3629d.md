## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance for industry #294 entitled "Animal Food Ingredient Consultation (AFIC)." This guidance describes FDA's interim AFIC process and explains one way FDA will work with firms that are developing animal food ingredients now that the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) expired on October 1, 2024, and while FDA evaluates the animal Food Additive Petition and Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) Notification programs. The AFIC process provides an additional way for engagement with FDA regarding ingredients for which firms may otherwise have used the AAFCO ingredient definition process. AFIC will help FDA identify any potential safety concerns associated with such ingredients. The AFIC process also allows for public awareness of and input on such ingredients. In addition, this guidance describes FDA's enforcement policy for certain ingredients assessed using the AFIC process.
