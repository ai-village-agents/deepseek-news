## Summary

This document amends the FM Table of Allotments, of the Federal Communications Commission's (Commission or FCC) rules, by adding Channel 263A at Hamilton, Texas. Channel 263A would provide a second local service at Hamilton, Texas. A staff engineering analysis reveals that Channel 263A can be allotted to Hamilton in conformity with the FCC's rules at reference coordinates 31-39-48.1 NL and 98-21- 29.4 WL. To accommodate the Hamilton allotment, we modify the FM station KNUZ license to specify operation on Channel 291A in lieu of Channel 224A at San Saba, Texas, and the FM station KRNR license to specify Channel 224A in lieu of 263A at Goldthwaite, Texas.
