## Summary

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is proposing to amend its regulations in order to fully implement the Administrative False Claims Act (AFCA), as amended by the Fiscal Year 2025 National Defense Authorization Act. This updated rule establishes clear and comprehensive administrative procedures for investigating, evaluating, and imposing civil penalties and monetary assessments on individuals or entities that knowingly make, submit, or present false claims, representations, or misleading statements to NASA. The AFCA offers a streamlined, agency-level enforcement remedy that enables NASA to more effectively address smaller, lower-dollar fraud cases, safeguard critical Federal funds, and strongly deter fraudulent conduct.
