## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Umlaut Engineering GmbH (previously P3 Engineering GmbH) HAFEX (Halon-free) hand-held P3HAFEX fire extinguishers (fire extinguishers). This AD was prompted by reports of a quality control issue on certain fire extinguishers, where the spindle geometries of the fire extinguishers were found to be out of tolerance. This AD requires removing affected fire extinguishers from service. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
