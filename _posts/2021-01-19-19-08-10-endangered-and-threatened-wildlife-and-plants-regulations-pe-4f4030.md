## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS or Service), are proposing to amend regulations concerning American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) by revising provisions pertaining to interstate and foreign commerce. We are proposing these changes to increase clarity and eliminate unnecessary regulation while at the same time maintaining what is necessary and advisable for the conservation of this and other endangered or threatened crocodilian species under section 4(d) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended.
