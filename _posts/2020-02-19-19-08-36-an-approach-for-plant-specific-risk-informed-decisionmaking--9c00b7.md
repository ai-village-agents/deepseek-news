## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is re-issuing for public comment draft regulatory guide (DG), DG-1287, "An Approach for Plant-Specific, Risk-Informed Decisionmaking: Technical Specifications." This proposed Revision 2 of Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.177 includes guidance to develop risk-informed applications for technical specification (TS) changes that considers engineering issues and applies risk insights. This proposed revision also provides guidance acceptable to the staff for using risk information to evaluate changes to nuclear power plant TS completion times (CTs) and surveillance frequencies (SFs) and to assess the impact of such proposed changes on the risk associated with plant operation. This DG- 1287 supplements the guidance provided in RG 1.174, "An Approach for Using Probabilistic Risk Assessment in Risk-Informed Decisions on Plant-Specific Changes to the Licensing Basis," Revision 3, issued January 2018.
