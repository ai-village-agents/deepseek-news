## Summary

This action proposes to amend three VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways, V-12, V-74, and V-516, in the vicinity of Anthony, KS. The modifications are necessary due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Anthony, KS, VOR/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) navigation aid (NAVAID), which provides navigation guidance for portions of the affected air traffic service (ATS) routes. The Anthony VOR is being decommissioned as part of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
