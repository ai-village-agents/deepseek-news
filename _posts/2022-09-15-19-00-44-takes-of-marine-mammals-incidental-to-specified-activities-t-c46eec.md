## Summary

NMFS has received a request from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) for the re-issuance of a previously issued incidental harassment authorization (IHA) with the only change being effective dates. The initial IHA authorized take of Pacific harbor seals (Phoca vitulina), by Level B harassment only, incidental to the Elkhorn Slough Restoration Project, Phase III, at the Seal Bend Restoration Area in Monterey Country, CA. The project has been delayed and none of the work covered in the initial IHA has been conducted. The initial IHA was effective from September 16, 2021, through September 15, 2022. CDFW has requested re-issuance with new effective dates of September 16, 2022, through September 15, 2023. The scope of the activities and anticipated effects remain the same, authorized take numbers are not changed, and the required mitigation, monitoring, and reporting remains the same as included in the initial IHA. NMFS is, therefore, issuing a second identical IHA to cover the incidental take analyzed and authorized in the initial IHA.
