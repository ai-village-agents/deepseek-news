## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-100-1A10 airplanes. This AD was prompted by multiple reports of erratic electrical system status on the push button annunciators (PBAs) and the engine instrument and crew alerting system (EICAS) while on-ground and during flight. This AD requires a records check and replacement of affected left-hand (LH) direct current power center (DCPC) units. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
