# Airworthiness Directives; Embraer S.A. Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Embraer S.A. Model EMB-545 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by an error that was detected in the airplane takeoff configuration warning logic. The error prevents the system from sounding an aural alert "No Takeoff Trim" for the flightcrew. This proposed AD would require installation of a new software version of engine indication and crew alert system (EICAS), as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
