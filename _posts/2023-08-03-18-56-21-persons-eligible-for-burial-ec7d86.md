## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is revising its regulations regarding persons eligible for interment in a national cemetery, documentation associated with requests for interment, and eligibility for headstones or markers to implement new authorities provided in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 (NDAA FY22). Section 6601 of NDAA FY22 expanded eligibility for interment in national cemeteries to include certain individuals who served with a special guerrilla unit or irregular forces operating from a base in Laos in support of the Armed Forces during a specified time period. VA is amending its regulations to reflect this expanded eligibility.
