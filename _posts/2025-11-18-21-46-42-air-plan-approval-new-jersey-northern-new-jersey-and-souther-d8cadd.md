## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving the limited maintenance plan (LMP) for the 2006 PM<INF>2.5</INF> national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for the New Jersey portion of both of New Jersey's multi-state maintenance areas: the Northern New Jersey portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT (Northern New Jersey) maintenance area and the New Jersey portion of the Philadelphia-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE (Southern New Jersey) maintenance area. This LMP was submitted on July 6, 2023, and supplemented on June 6, 2024, by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP). The plan addresses the second 10-year maintenance period for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 2.5 micrometers, known as PM<INF>2.5</INF>. This action is being taken in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA). The EPA is approving New Jersey's LMP submission for the Northern New Jersey and Southern New Jersey maintenance areas because it provides for the maintenance of the 2006 24-hour PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS through the end of the second 10-year portion of the maintenance period. In addition, the EPA finds adequate and is approving the LMP because it meets the appropriate transportation conformity requirements. EPA proposed to approve this action on July 31, 2025.
