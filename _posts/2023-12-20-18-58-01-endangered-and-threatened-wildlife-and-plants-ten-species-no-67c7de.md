## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce findings that 10 species are not warranted for listing as endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). After a thorough review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that it is not warranted at this time to list Hupp's Hill cave beetle (Pseudanophthalmus parvicollis), Hubbard's cave beetle (Pseudanophthalmus hubbardi), overlooked cave beetle (Pseudanophthalmus praetermissus), Shenandoah cave beetle (Pseudanophthalmus limicola), Little Kennedy cave beetle (Pseudanophthalmus cordicollis), Holsinger's cave beetle (Pseudanophthalmus holsingeri), Hubricht's cave beetle (Pseudanophthalmus hubrichti), silken cave beetle (Pseudanophthalmus sericus), Pinale[ntilde]o talussnail (Sonorella grahamensis), and San Xavier talussnail (Sonorella eremita). However, we ask the public to submit to us at any time any new information relevant to the status of any of the species mentioned above or their habitats.
