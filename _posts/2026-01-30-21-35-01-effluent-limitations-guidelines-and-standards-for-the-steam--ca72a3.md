## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA or Agency) is issuing a notice to correct some of the deadlines listed in the final rule, "Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Steam Electric Generating Point Source Category-- Deadline Extensions," which published in the Federal Register on December 31, 2025. After publication, the EPA became aware of post- signature typographical errors in the published regulatory text concerning compliance deadlines for pretreatment standards and related reporting recordkeeping requirements in the rule. This correction will ensure that the rule's compliance deadlines and reporting and recordkeeping deadlines match those in the version of the rule signed by the EPA Administrator.
