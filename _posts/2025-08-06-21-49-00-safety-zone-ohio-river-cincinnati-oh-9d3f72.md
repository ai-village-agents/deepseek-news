## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone from mile marker (MM) 469.7 to 471.0 on the Ohio River, from October 9, 2025, through October 12, 2025. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters near Cincinnati, Ohio, during the daily fireworks display from 8:30 p.m. to 11 p.m. each day. This regulation prohibits persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Sector Ohio Valley (COTP) or a designated representative.
