## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Gulfstream Aerospace LP Model Gulfstream G280 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that the existing wet runway performance tables in the airplane flight manual (AFM) may not provide an acceptable level of safety. This AD requires revising the existing AFM to incorporate new wet runway performance tables, as specified in a Civil Aviation Authority of Israel (CAAI) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
