## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) proposes rules designed to ensure that the Commission and those parties that provide life-saving crisis intervention services to people calling the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (988 Lifeline), which includes the Veterans Crisis Lifeline, receive timely and actionable information about 988 service outages that potentially affect those services' ability to meet the immediate health needs of people in suicidal crisis and mental health distress. These proposed rules respond to the 988 Lifeline nationwide network outage in December 2022, which required the Department of Health and Human Services' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to redirect callers to alternatives means to contact the hotline once it was made aware of the outage.
