## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has accepted for review and docketed an application from Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) for a construction permit for the Clinch River Nuclear Site, Unit 1 reactor to be built in Roane County, Tennessee. In addition, the NRC is providing notice that an uncontested hearing will be held on the TVA construction permit application at a time and place to be set in the future by the presiding officer for the uncontested hearing. This notice also provides the public an opportunity to request a hearing and petition for leave to intervene (i.e., contested hearing) with respect to that application. The NRC staff is currently conducting a detailed technical review of the construction permit application. If the NRC issues a construction permit, the applicant, TVA, would be authorized to construct its proposed reactor in accordance with the provisions of the construction permit. Because the application contains Sensitive Unclassified Non-Safeguards Information (SUNSI), this notice includes an order that imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI for contention preparation.
