## Summary

On October 30, 2023, the Maritime Administration (MARAD) published a Notice of Availability and Request for Information (NOA and RFI) in the Federal Register to determine preservation interest from entities that may wish to acquire the National Historic Landmark (NHL) Nuclear Ship Savannah (NSS). MARAD is decommissioning the nuclear power plant of the NSS, which will result in the termination of the ship's Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) license, making the ship available for disposition, including potential conveyance or preservation. Information received in response to this RFI will help to inform the development of viable preservation alternatives for the NSS. Due to interest generated and to allow interested parties additional time to respond, MARAD is extending the response period by 45 days, to April 1, 2024, and adding an additional information session/site visit. In responding to the RFI, please review the below SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION/Information Requested section to inform your submission.
