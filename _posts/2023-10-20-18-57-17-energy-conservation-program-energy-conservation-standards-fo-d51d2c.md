## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") published a direct final rule to establish new and amended energy conservation standards for electric motors in the Federal Register on June 1, 2023. DOE has determined that the comments received in response to the direct final rule do not provide a reasonable basis for withdrawing the direct final rule. Therefore, DOE provides this document confirming the effective and compliance date of those standards.
