## Summary

This action approves and implements Framework Adjustment 65 to the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan. This rule revises the rebuilding plan for Gulf of Maine cod, sets catch limits for 16 of the 20 multispecies (groundfish) stocks, and makes a temporary modification to the accountability measures for Georges Bank cod. This action also corrects erroneous regulations and removes outdated regulations. This action also implements an emergency action to set fishing year 2023 catch limits for Gulf of Maine haddock. This action is necessary to respond to updated scientific information and to achieve the goals and objectives of the fishery management plan. The measures are intended to help prevent overfishing, rebuild overfished stocks, achieve optimum yield, and ensure that management measures are based on the best scientific information available. The emergency action is necessary to avoid a potential shut-down of the groundfish fishery in the Gulf of Maine in fishing year 2023, while still preventing overfishing for Gulf of Maine haddock.
