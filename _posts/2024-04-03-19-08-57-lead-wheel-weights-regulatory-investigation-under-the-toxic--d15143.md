## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) is requesting comments and information to assist in the potential development of regulations for the manufacture (including importing), processing (including recycling), and distribution in commerce of lead for wheel-balancing weights ("lead wheel weights") under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). To inform this consideration, EPA is requesting comment and information from all stakeholders on the use and exposure to lead from the manufacture (including importing), processing (including recycling), distribution in commerce, use, and disposal of lead wheel weights, as well as information on their substitutes, to help determine if there is unreasonable risk to human health and the environment associated with this use. This action is relevant to a petition for a writ of mandamus filed in August 2023, by the Ecology Center, Center for Environmental Health, United Parents Against Lead & Other Environmental Hazards, and Sierra Club in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit requesting the court to direct EPA to conduct a rulemaking regulating lead wheel weights under TSCA.
