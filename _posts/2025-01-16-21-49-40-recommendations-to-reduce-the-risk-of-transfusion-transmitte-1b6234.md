## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, Agency, or we) is announcing the availability of a draft document entitled "Recommendations To Reduce the Risk of Transfusion-Transmitted Malaria." The draft guidance document provides blood establishments that collect blood and blood components with FDA's revised recommendations to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted malaria (TTM). The guidance recommends selectively testing blood donations from donors at risk for malaria using an FDA-licensed donor screening nucleic acid test (NAT) for Plasmodium species (spp.), the causative agents of malaria. The draft guidance, when finalized, is intended to supersede the document entitled "Recommendations To Reduce the Risk of Transfusion-Transmitted Malaria," dated December 2022.
