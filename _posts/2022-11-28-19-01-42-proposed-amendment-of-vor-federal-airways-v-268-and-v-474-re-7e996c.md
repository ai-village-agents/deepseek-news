## Summary

This action proposes to amend VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-268 and V-474, revoke Jet Route J-518 and VOR Federal airway V-119, and establish Area Navigation (RNAV) route Q-178. The FAA is proposing this action due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Indian Head, PA, VOR/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) navigational aid (NAVAID). The Indian Head VOR is being decommissioned in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
