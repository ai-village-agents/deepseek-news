## Summary

OSHA is withdrawing the proposal to amend the OSHA 300 Log by adding a column that employers would use to record work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Withdrawal of the proposal does not change any employer's obligation to complete and retain occupational injury and illness records under OSHA's regulations. Withdrawal of the proposal also does not change the recording criteria or definitions used for these records.
