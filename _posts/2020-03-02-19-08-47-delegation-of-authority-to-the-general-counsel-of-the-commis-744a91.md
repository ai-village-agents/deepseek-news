## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") is revising regulations with respect to the delegations of authority to the Commission's General Counsel. The revisions are a result of the Commission's experience with its bankruptcy program and they are intended to conserve Commission resources by delegating to staff the discretion to file objections in bankruptcy cases with respect to the frequently recurring issue of non-debtor third-party releases. The revisions will expedite and enhance the effectiveness of the Commission's bankruptcy program by enabling staff to meet bankruptcy court deadlines that affect issues important to the Commission.
