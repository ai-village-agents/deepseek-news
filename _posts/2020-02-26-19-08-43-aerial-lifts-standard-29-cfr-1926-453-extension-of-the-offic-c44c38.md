OSHA solicits public comments concerning the proposal to extend the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval of the information collection requirement contained in the Aerial Lift Standard. Employers who modify an aerial lift for uses other than those provided by the manufacturer must obtain a certificate from the manufacturer or equivalent entity certifying that the modification is in conformance with applicable American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards and the OSHA Standard, and the equipment is as safe as it was prior to the modification.
