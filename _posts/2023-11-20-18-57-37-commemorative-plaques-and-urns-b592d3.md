## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes to revise its regulations to implement new statutory authority to furnish commemorative plaques and urns for certain veterans whose cremated remains are not interred.

Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2020" (the Act).
