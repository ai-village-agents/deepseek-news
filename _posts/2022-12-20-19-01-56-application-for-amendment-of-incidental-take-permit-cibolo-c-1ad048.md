## Summary

TF Cibolo Canyons LP (applicant) has applied to the U.S. and Wildlife Service (Service) to amend their existing incidental take permit (ITP), pursuant to the Endangered Species Act. In support of the application, the applicant submitted a proposed amendment to their Cibolo Canyon Master Phase II Environmental Assessment and Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP). The requested amendment, if approved, would continue authorization of incidental take of the golden-cheeked warbler. We also announce the availability of a draft screening form that has been prepared to evaluate the ITP application in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). We invite the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies to comment on the ITP application, as well as the amended HCP and draft NEPA screening form.
