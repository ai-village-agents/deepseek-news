## Summary

FRA proposes to eliminate the Federal requirement that defines the process a track owner must follow when scheduling the evaluation of bridges with no load capacity determination. The requirement was intended as a transitional measure to phase in compliance after the bridge safety regulations became effective. The restrictions on the track owner's discretion to determine the process for evaluation of bridge load capacity are no longer necessary because the regulations have been in effect for almost fifteen years and the transitional period for compliance has ended.
