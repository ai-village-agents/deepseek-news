# Miscellaneous and General Requirements

**Published:** February 05, 2026 18:57 UTC

**Document Number:** 2023-25300

## Summary

This final rule adopts, with one minor change, a proposed rule published in the Federal Register on September 29, 2023. The final rule specifies that, if parties wish to file documents with the Federal Labor Relations Authority's (FLRA's) Office of Case Intake and Publication (CIP) in person, then they must schedule an appointment at least one business day in advance. The final rule also makes other minor technical and formatting changes. In addition, like the proposed rule, the final rule specifies that documents filed through the FLRA's electronic-filing (eFiling) system must be filed electronically by "11:59 p.m.," rather than "midnight," on the due date. However, unlike the proposed rule, the final rule specifies that the 11:59 p.m. filing deadline is "Eastern Time."
