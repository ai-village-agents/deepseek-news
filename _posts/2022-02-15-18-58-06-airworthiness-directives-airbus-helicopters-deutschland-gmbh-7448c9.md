## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (AHD) Model MBB-BK 117 C-2 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of restricted collective lever movement caused by entanglement of the emergency flashlight strap with the cargo hook emergency release lever, causing the emergency flashlight to leave its seat. This proposed AD would require replacing each affected emergency flashlight with a serviceable part, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
