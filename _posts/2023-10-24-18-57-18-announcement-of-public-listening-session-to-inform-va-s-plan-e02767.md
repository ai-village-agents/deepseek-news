## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is announcing a virtual listening session for the public to provide feedback on VA's plan to assess the scientific literature and historical claims data regarding certain adverse health conditions associated with military environmental exposures. VA's assessment will consider the possibility of a relationship between acute leukemias, chronic leukemias and multiple myeloma and exposure to fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) from airborne hazards and open burn pits for Veterans who were deployed in the Southwest Asia theater of operations or are covered Veterans, as defined by law. VA previously announced its plan in the Federal Register on July 26, 2023. During the listening session, Veterans Health Administration (VHA) subject matter experts will listen to public feedback and may ask questions but will not share proposals for specific conditions nor address the merits of any comments provided.
