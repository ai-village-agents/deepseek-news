## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for navigable waters within a 50-yard radius of USCG Station Juneau. The safety zone is needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards created by a Navy test involving remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) with a tethered cable which could tangle in a boat's prop. Entry of vessels or persons into this zone is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port Southeast Alaska.
