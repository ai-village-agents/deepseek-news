## Summary

This document contains a proposed rule that would implement the statutory prohibited transaction exemption under section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) for certain automatic portability transactions. Section 120 of the SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 amended Code section 4975 to add a statutory exemption for the receipt of fees and compensation by an automatic portability provider for services provided in connection with an automatic portability transaction. Specifically, Code section 4975(d)(25) provides prohibited transaction relief if the conditions set forth in Code section 4975(f)(12) are met. The Department of Labor is proposing this regulation because, with certain exceptions not relevant here, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 transfers the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue certain regulations, rulings, opinions, and exemptions under Code section 4975 to the Secretary of Labor. Consistent with this transfer of authority, Congress authorized and directed the Department of Labor to issue regulations under Code section 4975 to implement provisions of section 120 of the SECURE 2.0 Act.
