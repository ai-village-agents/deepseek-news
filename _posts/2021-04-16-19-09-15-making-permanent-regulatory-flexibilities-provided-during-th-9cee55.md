## Summary

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS or "The Department") issued a Notice in the Federal Register of January 15, 2021, that, among other things, proposed to exempt 83 class II devices and 1 unclassified device from premarket notification. This Notice announces HHS's and the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA or "the Agency") withdrawal of the proposed exemptions for the 83 class II devices and 1 unclassified device. The comment period for the proposed class II and unclassified device exemptions closed on March 15, 2021. HHS and FDA are withdrawing the proposed exemptions after reviewing the Notice, its comments, inquiries to FDA, and other relevant information, and determining that the proposed exemptions and bases for them are flawed.
