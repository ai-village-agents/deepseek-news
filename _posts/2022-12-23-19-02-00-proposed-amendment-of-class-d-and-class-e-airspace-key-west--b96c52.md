## Summary

This action proposes to amend Class D airspace, Class E airspace designated as an extension to a Class D surface area, and Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Key West International Airport and Key West Naval Air Station (NAS), FL as a result of biennial airspace evaluations. This action would extend the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface for both airports by 0.1 nautical miles to ensure the safe transition to/from the terminal environment, as well as update the geographic coordinates for the airports and the Key West VORTAC. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.
