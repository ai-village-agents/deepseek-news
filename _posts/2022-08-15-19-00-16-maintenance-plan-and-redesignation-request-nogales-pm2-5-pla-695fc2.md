## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve the "FINAL SIP Revision: Nogales PM<INF>2.5</INF> Maintenance Plan and Redesignation Request (2006 Fine Particulate NAAQS)" ("Nogales Maintenance Plan" or "Plan") as a revision to the state implementation plan (SIP) for the State of Arizona. The Nogales Maintenance Plan includes, among other elements, an emissions inventory consistent with attainment, a maintenance demonstration, contingency provisions, and a motor vehicle emissions budget for the ten-year maintenance period. The EPA is also approving the State of Arizona's request to redesignate the Nogales planning area ("Nogales area") from nonattainment to attainment for the 2006 24-hour national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter of 2.5 micrometers or less (PM<INF>2.5</INF>). The EPA is finalizing these actions because this SIP revision meets the applicable Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act") requirements for maintenance plans and because the State has met the requirements under the Act for redesignation of a nonattainment area to attainment with respect to the Nogales area.
