## Summary

This action proposes amendments to the implementing regulations that govern the processes and timelines for state and Federal plans that implement emission guidelines under Clean Air Act (CAA) section 111(d). The proposed amendments include revisions to the timing requirements for state plan submittal, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s action on state plan submissions, the EPA's promulgation of a Federal plan, and for when states must establish increments of progress. These proposed amendments address the vacatur of certain timing requirements by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) in American Lung Association. v. EPA. The EPA is also proposing to add regulatory mechanisms to improve flexibility and efficiency in the submission, review, approval, revision, and implementation of state plans. This action further proposes new requirements for meaningful engagement with pertinent stakeholders as part of state plan development, including, but not limited to, industry, small businesses, and communities most affected by and vulnerable to the impacts of the plan. This action additionally proposes clarifying requirements for states' consideration of `remaining useful life and other factors' (RULOF) in applying a standard of performance. This action proposes to amend the definition of standard of performance and provide clarification associated with CAA section 111(d) compliance flexibilities, including trading or averaging. Finally, this action proposes requirements for the electronic submission of state plans and several other clarifications and minor revisions.
