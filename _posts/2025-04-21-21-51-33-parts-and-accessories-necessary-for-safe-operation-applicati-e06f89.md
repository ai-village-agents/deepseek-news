## Summary

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) announces its decision to renew K & L Trucking, Inc.'s (K & L, USDOT #193158) application for a limited 5-year exemption to allow the company to secure large metal coils to its trailers using a cargo securement system that differs from that required by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs). The Agency has determined that granting the exemption would likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to or greater than the level of safety provided by the regulation.
