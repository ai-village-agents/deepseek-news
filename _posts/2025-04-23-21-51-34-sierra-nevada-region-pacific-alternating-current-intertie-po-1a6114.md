## Summary

The Sierra Nevada Region (SN) of the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) proposes new long-term formula rates to become effective October 1, 2025, through September 30, 2030 for Pacific Alternating Current Intertie (PACI) Point-to-Point (PTP) transmission services. SN is proposing a cost-based formula rate for Statutory Service and two new equitable formula rates for sale of surplus capacity for non-Statutory Service. SN also proposes to supersede certain formula rates for short-term sales on the PACI, PACI-T4 and PACI-T5, (approved under Delegation Order No. S3-DEL-WAPA1-2023, Section 1.4.B) with these proposed long-term formula rates.
