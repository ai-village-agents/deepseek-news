## Summary

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to rename the established "Mendocino Ridge" American viticultural area (AVA) in Mendocino County, California, as "Mendocino Coast Ridge." The proposed name change would not affect the size or boundary description of the AVA. TTB designates viticultural areas to allow vintners to better describe the origin of their wines and to allow consumers to better identify wines they may purchase. TTB invites comments on this proposal.
