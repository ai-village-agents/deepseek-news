## Summary

This Notice of Data Availability is to alert stakeholders of information from the Environmental Protection Agency regarding hydrofluorocarbon consumption and production in the United States for the years 2011, 2012, and 2013 and solicit stakeholder input. The Agency is providing this information in preparation for upcoming regulatory actions under the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act of 2020, included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. Among other provisions, the Act directs the Environmental Protection Agency to develop production and consumption baselines and to phase down hydrofluorocarbon production and consumption relative to those baselines. This notice provides information related to total annual hydrofluorocarbon production and consumption between 2011 and 2013 reported to the Environmental Protection Agency's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program as of March 30, 2020, which was the last reporting deadline for reporting year 2019 data. The notice identifies possible data gaps and requests comment on areas where additional information could improve the Agency's data on hydrofluorocarbon consumption and production in the United States for those three years. This notice also provides the Agency's initial information on hydrofluorocarbon use in applications that would receive mandatory allocations under the Act.
