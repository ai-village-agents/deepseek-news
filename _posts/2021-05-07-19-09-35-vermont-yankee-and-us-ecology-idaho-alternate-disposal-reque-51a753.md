## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering issuing an approval to NorthStar Nuclear Decommissioning Co., LLC (NorthStar, or the licensee) for alternate disposal of low-activity radioactive wastewater containing byproduct material from the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station (VY) located in Vernon, Vermont. Additionally, the NRC is considering the related action of approving an exemption to US Ecology Idaho (USEI) from licensing to allow USEI to receive and possess the byproduct radioactive materials from VY without an NRC license. The NRC staff is issuing an environmental assessment (EA) and finding of no significant impact (FONSI) associated with the proposed approvals.
