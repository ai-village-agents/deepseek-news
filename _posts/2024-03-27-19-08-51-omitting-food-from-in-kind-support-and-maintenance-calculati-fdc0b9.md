## Summary

We are updating our Supplemental Security Income (SSI) regulations to remove food from the calculations of In-Kind Support and Maintenance (ISM). We are also adding conforming language to our definition of income. These changes simplify our rules by making them less cumbersome to administer and easier for the public to understand and follow, and they improve the equitable treatment of food assistance within the SSI program. This final rule also includes other minor revisions to our regulations related to income, including clarifying our longstanding position that income may be received "constructively."
