## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is supplementing a proposed approval published on October 9, 2020 ("October 2020 proposal"), for revisions to the Texas State Implementation Plan (SIP) to meet the Reasonable Further Progress (RFP) requirements for the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) serious nonattainment area for the 2008 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). This proposal supplements the EPA's October 2020 proposal with respect to the substitution of emission reductions of nitrogen oxide (NO<INF>X</INF>) for emission reductions of volatile organic compounds (VOC), based on comments received during the public comment period for the October 2020 proposal. In the October 2020 proposal, the EPA proposed to approve the substitution of NO<INF>X</INF> emission reductions for VOC emission reductions but did not address how the substitution is consistent with the Clean Air Act (CAA). In this supplemental proposal, EPA is proposing to approve the substitution of NO<INF>X</INF> emission reductions for VOC emission reductions as consistent with section 182(c)(2)(C) of the CAA. The EPA is providing an opportunity for public comment on this supplemental proposal. The EPA is not reopening for comment the October 2020 proposal. Comments received on the October 2020 proposal and this supplemental proposal will be addressed in a final rule.
