## Summary

On October 8, 2019, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff accepted and docketed an application submitted by SHINE Medical Technologies, LLC (SHINE), dated July 17, 2019, filed pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the NRC's regulations, for an operating license for the SHINE Medical Isotope Production Facility. In accordance with the NRC's regulations, any persons whose interest may be affected by the issuance of an operating license to SHINE may file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to intervene with respect to the action. Because the license application contains Sensitive Unclassified Non-Safeguards Information (SUNSI) and Safeguards Information (SGI), an included Order imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI and SGI for contention preparation.
