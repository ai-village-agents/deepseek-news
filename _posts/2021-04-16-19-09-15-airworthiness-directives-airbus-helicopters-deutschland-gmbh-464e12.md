# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (Airbus Helicopters) Model EC135P1, EC135P2, EC135P2+, EC135P3, EC135T1, EC135T2, EC135T2+, and EC135T3 helicopters. This proposed AD would require modification of the tail rotor (T/R) control installation, a functional test, and corrective actions as necessary. This proposed AD is prompted by cases of insufficient clearance between a certain T/R control bearing connection and the helicopter structure, which were detected on the production line. The FAA is proposing this AD to address an unsafe condition on these products.
