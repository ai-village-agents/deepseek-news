## Summary

Section 209 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the "Economic Growth Act") added section 38 to the United States Housing Act of 1937 and makes several amendments pertaining to small public housing agencies (PHAs). This notice explains how HUD designates small PHAs and implements section 209 provisions that reduce regulatory burden on small PHAs by reducing the number of inspections required for units with section 8(o) voucher assistance, and providing an exemption from environmental review requirements for development and modernization projects that have a total cost of not more than $100,000. This notice also identifies the small PHAs that are eligible for this section 209 regulatory relief.
