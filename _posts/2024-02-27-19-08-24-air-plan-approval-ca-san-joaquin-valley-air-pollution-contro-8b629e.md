## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve revisions to the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District (SJVAPCD) portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). The revisions were submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), on behalf of SJVAPCD, in response to the EPA's May 22, 2015 finding of substantial inadequacy and SIP call for certain provisions in the SIP related to exemptions and affirmative defenses applicable to excess emissions during startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) events. The EPA is finalizing approval of the SIP revisions because the Agency has determined that they are in accordance with the requirements for SIP provisions under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act) and correct deficiencies identified in the May 22, 2015, SIP call.
