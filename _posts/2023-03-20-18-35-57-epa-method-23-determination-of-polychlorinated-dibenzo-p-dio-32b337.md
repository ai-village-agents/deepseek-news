## Summary

This action finalizes editorial and technical revisions to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Method 23 (Determination of Polychlorinated Dibenzo-p-Dioxins, Polychlorinated Dibenzofurans, and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons from Stationary Sources). Final revisions include incorporating true, comprehensive, and stable isotope dilution for quantifying target compounds using corresponding carbon-13 labeled compounds for each target compound including most of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and changing the method quality control from the current prescriptive format to a more flexible performance-based approach with specified performance criteria. We are also finalizing revisions that expand the list of target compounds of Method 23 to include PAH and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB). The final revisions allow facilities and their test teams flexibility when sampling and measuring polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDF), PAH, and PCB from stationary sources with a comprehensive isotope dilution method while ensuring that the stack testing community can consistently implement the method across emissions sources and facilities.
