## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2025-17-12, which applies to all Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-1A11 (600) and CL-600-2A12 (601) airplanes, and certain Model CL-600-2B16 (601-3A, 601-3R, and 604 Variants) airplanes. AD 2025-17-12 requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2025-17-12, the FAA has determined that certain serial numbers for affected Model CL-600-2B16 (604 Variants) airplanes are not included in the applicability of AD 2025-17-12. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions specified in AD 2025-17-12 and would add airplanes to the applicability. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
