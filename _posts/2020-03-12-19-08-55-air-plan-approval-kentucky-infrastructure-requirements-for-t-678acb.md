## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve portions of the State Implementation Plan (SIP) submission, provided by the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Energy and Environment Cabinet, Department for Environmental Protection, through the Kentucky Division for Air Quality (KDAQ), on January 9, 2019, to demonstrate that the Commonwealth meets the infrastructure requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) for the 2015 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS). Whenever EPA promulgates a new or revised NAAQS, the CAA requires that each state adopt and submit a SIP for the implementation, maintenance and enforcement of each such NAAQS. KDAQ certified that the Kentucky SIP contains provisions that ensure the 2015 8-hour ozone NAAQS is implemented, enforced, and maintained in Kentucky. EPA is proposing to determine that Kentucky's submission addresses certain infrastructure elements for the 2015 8-hour ozone NAAQS.
