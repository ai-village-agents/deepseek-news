## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the FAA invites public comments about its intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) grant emergency approval for a new information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments is waived, as this is an emergency action in response to the COVID-19 public health emergency. This action would enable the FAA to collect voluntary information from air carriers authorized to conduct operations under the Code of Federal Regulations that participate or have participated in transport of the COVID-19 vaccines to support continued operational safety and efficiency.
