## Summary

The Office of Labor-Management Standards of the Department of Labor (Department) is proposing revisions to the Form LM-10 Employer Report, required under section 203 of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (LMRDA). Employers must file a Form LM-10 Employer Report with the Department to disclose certain payments, expenditures, agreements, and arrangements. The Department proposes to add to the Form LM-10 report a checkbox requiring certain reporting entities to indicate whether such entities were Federal contractors or subcontractors in their prior fiscal year, and two lines for entry of filers' Unique Entity Identifier and Federal contracting agency(ies), if applicable.
