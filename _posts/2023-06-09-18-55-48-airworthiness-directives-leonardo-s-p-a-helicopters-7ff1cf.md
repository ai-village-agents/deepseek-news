## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Leonardo S.p.a. Model A119 and AW119 MKII helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of an electrical failure of a starter-generator caused by a ruptured drive shaft. This proposed AD would require visually inspecting the drive shaft of an affected starter-generator and depending on the results, performing a dye penetrant inspection. Depending on the results of the dye penetrant inspection, this proposed AD would require replacing the starter- generator, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
