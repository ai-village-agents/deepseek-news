## Summary

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended, and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) of 1976, as amended, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Ely District Office, Ely, Nevada, intends to prepare a Resource Management Plan (RMP) amendment (RMPA), with an associated Environmental Assessment (EA), to the 2008 Ely District Record of Decision and Approved RMP. The proposed RMPA would evaluate whether the subject parcel of public land meets the disposal criteria described in Section 203 of the FLPMA, as amended, and allow the direct sale (without competition) of 0.66 acres of BLM managed public land to Nina Higgs, Trustee for Shirley Schena, if the parcel is determined to meet the disposal criteria. The purpose of the sale would be to resolve an inadvertent trespass and the EA would analyze the environmental effects of the direct sale of the land identified for disposal. The sale would be for no less than the appraised fair market value of $10,000. The sale would be subject to the applicable provisions of Section 203 of FLPMA and the BLM land sale regulations. Section 203 of FLPMA states that tracts of public land may be sold because of land use planning required under Section 202 of FLPMA; the subject parcel was not previously identified for disposal in the RMP, therefore the BLM must amend the RMP to allow the proposed sale to proceed. This notice serves to notify the public of the BLM's proposed realty action and initiates the public scoping process to solicit public comments on anticipated issues and planning criteria.
