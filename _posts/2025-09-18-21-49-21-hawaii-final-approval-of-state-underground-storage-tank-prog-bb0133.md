## Summary

On March 7, 2022, the State of Hawaii (Hawaii or State) received Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) final approval of revisions to its Underground Storage Tank Program (UST Program) under subtitle I of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Pursuant to RCRA, the EPA is proposing to amend its final approval of the Hawaii UST Program to clarify the statutory provisions that are part of the approved UST Program and identify some additional statutory provisions that are broader in scope and not part of the approved UST Program. This action also proposes to codify the EPA's approval of Hawaii's revised UST Program and to incorporate by reference the State statutes and regulations that the EPA has determined meet the requirements for approval.
