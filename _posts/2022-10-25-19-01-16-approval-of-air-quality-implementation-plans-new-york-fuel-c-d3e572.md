## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the New York State Implementation Plan (SIP) concerning the control and reduction of sulfur and particulate matter emissions from facilities in New York State. The proposed SIP revision consists of amendments to regulations outlined within New York's Codes, Rules and Regulations (NYCRR) for sulfur in fuel limits. The intended effect of this revision is to approve control strategies, required by the Clean Air Act, which will result in emission reductions that will help attain and maintain National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for fine particulate matter and sulfur dioxide emissions throughout New York State. Additionally, the proposed revisions will establish applicability criteria, composition limits and permitting requirements for waste oils; establish monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements for facilities that are determined eligible to burn waste oil; and allow for the burning of waste oils in space heaters at automotive maintenance/service facilities.
