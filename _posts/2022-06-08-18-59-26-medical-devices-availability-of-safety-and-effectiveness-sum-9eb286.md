## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is publishing a list of premarket approval applications (PMAs) that have been approved from January 1, 2021, through February 14, 2022. This list is intended to inform the public of the availability of safety and effectiveness summaries of approved PMAs through the internet and the Agency's Dockets Management Staff. This is the last notice of this kind considering FDA's rule discontinuing the practice of publishing such summaries in the Federal Register. As indicated in that rule, FDA will continue to publish to make available on the internet and place on public display summaries of safety and effectiveness for approved PMAs.
