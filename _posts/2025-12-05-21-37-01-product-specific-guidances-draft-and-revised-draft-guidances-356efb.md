## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, Agency, or we) is announcing the availability of additional draft and revised draft product-specific guidances. The draft guidances provide product- specific recommendations on, among other things, the design of bioequivalence (BE) studies to support abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs). In the Federal Register of June 11, 2010, FDA announced the availability of a guidance for industry entitled "Bioequivalence Recommendations for Specific Products" that explained the process that would be used to make product-specific guidances available to the public on FDA's website. The draft guidances identified in this notice were developed using the process described in that guidance.
