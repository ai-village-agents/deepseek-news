## Summary

The Economic Development Administration ("EDA"), U.S. Department of Commerce ("DOC"), is issuing a final rule to update the agency's regulations implementing the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms ("TAAF") provisions of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended ("Trade Act"), and the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965, as amended ("PWEDA"). The changes to the TAAF program regulations clarify the process for import-impacted U.S. manufacturing firms, oil and natural gas production firms, and service firms to obtain technical assistance--identified in the Trade Act as "adjustment assistance"--through the TAAF program, reorganize the regulations to make them easier to read and understand, incorporate best practices, and bring the regulations into closer alignment with the program's statutory requirements. The result will be to ease the burden on firms seeking adjustment assistance through the TAAF program and make it easier for Trade Adjustment Assistance Centers ("TAACs") to work with firms. EDA is also eliminating certain TAAF and PWEDA regulations that are unnecessary or duplicative because they describe requirements already established in other regulations or award documentation.
