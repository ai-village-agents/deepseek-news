## Summary

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is issuing this Compliance Bulletin and Policy Guidance (Bulletin) to address the treatment of certain private student loans (student loans) following bankruptcy discharge. In order to secure a discharge of "qualified education loans" in bankruptcy, borrowers must demonstrate that the loans would impose an undue hardship if not discharged. Student loans that are not "qualified education loans" (non-qualified student loans), however, are discharged under standard bankruptcy discharge orders. In recent supervisory work, CFPB examiners identified servicers that did not determine whether education loans were qualified or non-qualified. As a result, servicers improperly returned non-qualified education loans to repayment after a bankruptcy concluded and continued to bill and collect payments on the loans, even though the borrowers' bankruptcy discharges released them from these debts. This conduct violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act's (CFPA's) prohibition on unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. CFPB examiners directed the servicers to cease collection of discharged loans and take remedial action, which includes conducting a multi-year lookback and issuing refunds to affected consumers. In its oversight, the CFPB will pay particular attention to servicers' practices in connection with student loans that are the subject of bankruptcy discharge orders, including whether discharged debts are being collected contrary to bankruptcy court orders.
