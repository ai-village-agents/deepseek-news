## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Missouri on January 15, 2019, and supplemented by letter on June 14, 2019. Missouri requests that the EPA remove a rule related to control of emissions from the solvent cleanup operations in the Kansas City, Missouri area from its SIP. This removal does not have an adverse effect on air quality. The EPA's approval of this rule revision is in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and will ensure consistency between state and federally-approved rules.
