## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, received an application from Ms. Lorraine Tveten for an incidental take permit (ITP) pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. The ITP would authorize "take" of the Yelm pocket gopher, incidental to otherwise lawful activities during construction of a single-family home and agricultural buildings in Thurston County, Washington. The application includes a habitat conservation plan (HCP) with measures to minimize and mitigate the impacts of the taking on the covered species. We have also prepared a draft environmental action statement for our preliminary determination that the HCP and permit decision may be eligible for categorical exclusion under the National Environmental Policy Act. We provide this notice to open a public comment period and invite comments from all interested parties regarding the documents.
