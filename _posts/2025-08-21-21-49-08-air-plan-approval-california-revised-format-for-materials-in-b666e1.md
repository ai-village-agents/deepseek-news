## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is revising the format for materials submitted by the State of California that are incorporated by reference into the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). The regulations and other materials affected by this format change have all been previously submitted by the State of California and approved by the EPA. This format revision will primarily affect the "Identification of plan--in part" sections, as well as the format of the SIP materials that will be available for public inspection at the EPA Regional Office and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). This action, which only relates to source- specific requirements and certain local and regional California air district rules, is the fourth of a series of actions intended to change the format for the entire California SIP.
