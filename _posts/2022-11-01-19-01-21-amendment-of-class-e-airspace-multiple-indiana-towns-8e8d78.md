This action due to airspace reviews conducted as part of the decommissioning of the Kokomo very high frequency (VHF) omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimal Operational Network (MON) Program. The names and geographic coordinates of various airports are also being updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
