## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is amending its regulations to implement provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020. The final rule will permit a prime contractor with an individual subcontracting plan to apply credit for subcontracts to small businesses at lower tiers toward its subcontracting goals. To do so, the prime contractor would incorporate the lower-tier subcontracting performance into its subcontracting-plan goals.
