## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain MHI RJ Aviation ULC Model CL-600-2B19 (Regional Jet Series 100 & 440) airplanes; Model CL-600-2C10 (Regional Jet Series 700, 701 & 702) airplanes; Model CL-600-2C11 (Regional Jet Series 550) airplanes; Model CL-600-2D15 (Regional Jet Series 705) airplanes; Model CL-600- 2D24 (Regional Jet Series 900) airplanes; and Model CL-600-2E25 (Regional Jet Series 1000) airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of displayed headings changing from MAG to TRU with no pilot action, which may result in misleading heading information on both primary function displays (PFDs) and multi-function displays (MFDs), and misleading course information on flight management systems (FMSs). This AD requires amending the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to provide the flightcrew with updated procedures for accurate heading and course information. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
