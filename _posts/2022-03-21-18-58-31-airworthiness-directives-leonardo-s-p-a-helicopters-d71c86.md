## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Leonardo S.p.a. Model AW169 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a blockage in a fuel tank vent line. This proposed AD would require inspecting the fuel tank vent lines, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
