## Summary

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Buffalo District, has received an application for a Department of the Army (DA) permit (USACE number LRB-2000-02198) from Micron New York Semiconductor Manufacturing LLC (Micron), a wholly owned subsidiary of Micron Technology, Inc., to construct a semiconductor manufacturing facility for leading-edge manufacturing of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips. The USACE, as the lead federal agency under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), has determined the proposed project may significantly affect the quality of the human environment and will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS). The USACE action will be to issue, issue with modifications, or deny a DA permit for the proposed project. The EIS will assess the potential social, economic, and environmental impacts of the proposed project.
