## Summary

The 21st Century Cures Act established HITAC to provide recommendations to the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology on policies, standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria relating to the implementation of a health information technology infrastructure that advances the electronic access, exchange, and use of health information. The Act gave the Comptroller General of the United States responsibility for appointing a portion of HITAC's members. The Act requires that members at least reflect providers, ancillary health care workers, consumers, purchasers, health plans, health information technology developers, researchers, patients, relevant Federal agencies, and individuals with technical expertise on health care quality, system functions, privacy, security, and on the electronic exchange and use of health information, including the use standards for such activity. GAO is now accepting nominations for HITAC appointments that will be effective January 1, 2023. Members serve 3-year terms, with the terms subject to renewal, for a total not to exceed 6 years of service on the committee. From these nominations, GAO expects to appoint at least 4 new HITAC members, focusing especially on patients or consumers, health care providers, ancillary health care workers, and individuals with technical expertise on health care quality, system functions, privacy, security, and on the electronic exchange and use of health information. Nominations should be sent to the email address listed below.
