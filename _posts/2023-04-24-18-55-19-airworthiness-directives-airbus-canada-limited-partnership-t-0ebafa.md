## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports the overwing emergency exit door (OWEED) escape line may be incorrectly routed. This AD requires inspecting the OWEED escape line and correcting the routing if required, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
