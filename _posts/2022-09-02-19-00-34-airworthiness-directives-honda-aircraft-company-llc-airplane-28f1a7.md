## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-05- 13, which applied to certain Honda Aircraft Company LLC (Honda) Model HA-420 airplanes. AD 2022-05-13 required incorporating temporary revisions into the airplane flight manual (AFM) and the quick reference handbook (QRH) that modify procedures for windshield heat operation until the affected windshield assemblies are replaced. This AD was prompted by typographical errors found in certain document numbers specified in the preamble and in certain paragraphs of the regulatory information in AD 2022-05-13. This AD retains all actions required by AD 2022-05-13 and corrects the incorrect document numbers. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
