**Published:** February 04, 2026 21:37 UTC

## Summary

This proposed rule would revise the requirements that Medicare and Medicaid certified hospitals must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These changes are necessary to protect the health and safety of children and reflect HHS' review of recent information on the safety and efficacy of sex-rejecting procedures (SRPs) on children. The revisions to the requirements would prohibit hospitals from performing sex-rejecting procedures on children.
