## Summary

This action proposes to amend Class D airspace, Class E Surface airspace, and Class E Airspace Designated as an Extension to Class D airspace at Martin State Airport, Baltimore, MD. This action would replace the Baltimore Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range Collocated Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) with the term Point of Origin. Also, this action would remove unnecessary verbiage from the descriptor header. In addition, this action would also make an editorial change replacing the term Airport/Facility Directory with the term Chart Supplement in the legal descriptions of associated Class D and E airspace and make the editorial change replacing the term Notice to Airmen with the term Notice to Air Missions. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.
