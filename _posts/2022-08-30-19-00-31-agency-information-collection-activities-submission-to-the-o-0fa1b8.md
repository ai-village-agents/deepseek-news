## Summary

In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), this notice announces that the Information Collection Request (ICR) summarized below will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected burden. The ICR is titled "Heavy Vehicle Crash Avoidance Systems" and is identified by OMB Control Number 2127-0741. It is currently approved through August 31, 2022. This project was delayed due to COVID-19 shutdowns and precautions. The extension is necessary to continue the current data collection to completion. This extension request updates the burden hours to reflect the numbers of respondents that are needed to complete the study, updates to time estimates for responses, and mean hourly rates. Additionally, this notice provides clarification on the burden hours and the costs to the public. A Federal Register Notice with a 60- day comment period soliciting comments on the following information collection was published on May 10, 2022.
