## Summary

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) through its National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) is developing a successor precision medicine trial to `NCI-Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (NCI- MATCH)' entitled `NCI-ComboMATCH'. The principal of this intiative is to overcome drug resistance to single-agent therapy by developing genomically-directed targeted agent combinations. All combinations must be supported by robust, preclinical in vivo evidence. NCI-ComboMATCH trial leadership invites applications for Clinical Laboratory Improvements Program (CLIA) certified/accredited laboratories that test tumor specimens from patients utilizing Next- Generation Sequencing (NGS) assays to participate in the NCI-ComboMATCH trial. In order to support this trial, the designated laboratories participating in NCI-ComboMATCH will identify patients for the specific variants needed for trial eligibility. Laboratories will be required to contact any of the NCTN sites that have activated NCI-ComboMATCH if a specimen sent from one of these sites has a variant(s) that would potentially make the patient eligible for one of the treatment arms.
