## Summary

NMFS proposes to implement management measures described in Abbreviated Framework Amendment 3 (Abbreviated Framework 3) to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Snapper-Grouper Fishery of the South Atlantic Region, as prepared and submitted by the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (South Atlantic Council). If implemented, Abbreviated Framework 3 and this proposed rule would revise the commercial and recreational annual catch limits (ACLs) and recreational annual catch target (ACT) for blueline tilefish in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the South Atlantic. The purpose of this proposed rule is to ensure that ACLs for South Atlantic blueline tilefish are based on the best scientific information available, to achieve and maintain optimum yield (OY), and to prevent overfishing while minimizing to the extent practicable, adverse social and economic effects.
