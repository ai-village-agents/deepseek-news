## Summary

We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), are announcing receipt of a proposed rule amendment to the Wyoming regulatory program (Wyoming program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). Between 2017 and 2021, the Wyoming Environmental Quality Council (EQC) approved several changes to the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (WYDEQ) Rules of Practice and Procedure. These updates largely focused on "Contested Case Hearings" rules and regulations for Wyoming State agencies. Accordingly, the State submitted this amendment proposal to OSMRE on its own initiative.
