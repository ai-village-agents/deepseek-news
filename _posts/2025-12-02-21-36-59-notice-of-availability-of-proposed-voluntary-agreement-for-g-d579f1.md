## Summary

The FAA, in cooperation with the National Park Service (NPS), has initiated the development of a voluntary agreement pursuant to the National Parks Air Tour Management Act of 2000 (the Act) and its implementing regulations. The Act allows the FAA and NPS to enter into voluntary agreements with commercial air tour operators. A voluntary agreement manages commercial air tour operations over a national park by establishing conditions for the conduct of the commercial air tour operations. Implementation of a voluntary agreement helps protect park resources and the visitor experience without compromising aviation safety or the air traffic control system. This notice announces the public availability of the proposed voluntary agreement for Golden Gate National Recreation Area, San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park, Point Reyes National Seashore, and Muir Woods National Monument.
