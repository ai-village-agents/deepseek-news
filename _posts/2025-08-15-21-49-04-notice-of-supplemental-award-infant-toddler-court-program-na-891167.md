## Summary

HRSA is providing additional award funds of $1,750,000 in federal fiscal year (FY) 2025 to ZERO TO THREE National Center for Infant, Toddler and Families, Inc., the current recipient of the Infant-Toddler Court Program (ITCP)--National Resource Center (NRC) cooperative agreement (HRSA-22-074), to support the continuation of existing activities, using the Infant Toddler Court (ITC) approach, to improve child welfare and early childhood systems and advance early developmental health and well-being. The supplemental funding would provide financial and technical support to local infant-toddler court sites that previously received funding under HRSA-18-123, but that do not currently receive HRSA funding under HRSA-22-073/074, and expand technical assistance (TA) needed to support the continuation and expansion of State Award activities funded under HRSA-22-073/074.
