## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a revision to the Maricopa County Air Quality Department's (MCAQD or County) portion of the Arizona State Implementation Plan (SIP). The revision addresses Arizona's reasonably available control technology (RACT) SIP obligations for the Phoenix- Mesa ozone nonattainment area that is classified as Moderate nonattainment for the 2008 ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). We are approving a local rule that regulates emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) and particulate matter (PM) from power plants under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act).
