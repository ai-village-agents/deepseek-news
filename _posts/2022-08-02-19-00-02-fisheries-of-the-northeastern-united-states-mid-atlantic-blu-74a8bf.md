## Summary

NMFS proposes specifications for the 2022 blueline tilefish fishery north of the North Carolina/Virginia border and projected specifications for 2023 and 2024. The proposed action is necessary to establish allowable harvest levels and other management measures to prevent overfishing while allowing optimum yield, consistent with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act and the Tilefish Fishery Management Plan. It is also intended to inform the public of these proposed specifications for the 2022 fishing year and projected specifications for 2023 and 2024.
