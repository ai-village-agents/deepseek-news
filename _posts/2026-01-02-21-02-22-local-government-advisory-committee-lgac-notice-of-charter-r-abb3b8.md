## Summary

Notice is hereby given that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined that, in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), 5 U.S.C. 10, the Local Government Advisory Committee (LGAC)is in the public interest and supports the EPA in performing its duties and responsibilities under federal environmental statutes. Accordingly, the LGAC's charter will be renewed for an additional two-year period. The LGAC is an independent, policy-oriented advisory committee of elected and appointed government officials. The Committee provides policy advice and recommendations to the EPA Administrator to assist the agency in ensuring that its regulations, policies, guidance, and technical assistance both support and improve the capacity of local governments to implement and carry out programs. With the renewal of its charter, the LGAC is requesting nominations for membership to its Small Communities Advisory Subcommittee. More information is detailed below. The renewed LGAC charter can be found at https://www.epa.gov/ocir/local-government- advisory-committee-lgac. The LGAC is chartered under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), Public Law 92-463, to advise the EPA Administrator on environmental issues impacting local governments. In addition, EPA invites nominations from a range of qualified candidates to be considered for appointment to The Small Communities Advisory Subcommittee (SCAS), a standing subcommittee of the LGAC, which was established to advise the Administrator on environmental issues of concern to the residents of smaller communities. Qualified nominees for the SCAS must hold elected positions with local, tribal, state, or territorial governments, or serve in a full-time government position appointed by an elected official.
