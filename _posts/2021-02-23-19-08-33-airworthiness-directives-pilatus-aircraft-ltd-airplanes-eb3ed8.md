## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Pilatus Aircraft Ltd. (Pilatus) Model PC-24 airplanes. This AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as electrical harness installations on PC-24 airplanes that are not in compliance with the approved design. This unsafe condition could lead to wire chafing and potential arcing or failure of wires having the incorrect length, possibly resulting in loss of system redundancy, or generation of smoke and smell, or loss of power plant fire protection function. This AD requires modifying the electrical harness installation. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
