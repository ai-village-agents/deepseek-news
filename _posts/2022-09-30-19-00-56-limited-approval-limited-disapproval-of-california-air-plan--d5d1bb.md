## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing a limited approval and limited disapproval of California Code of Regulations, Title 17, Division 3, Chapter 1, Subchapter 10 Climate Change, Article 4, Subarticle 13: Greenhouse Gas Emission Standards for Crude Oil and Natural Gas Facilities (Oil and Gas Methane Rule) into the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from crude oil and natural gas facilities. Under the authority of the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), this action simultaneously approves a state rule that regulates these emission sources and identifies deficiencies with the rule that must be corrected for the EPA to grant full approval of the rule. We are also finalizing disapprovals of the reasonably available control technology (RACT) demonstrations for the 2008 and 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for sources covered by the EPA's 2016 Control Techniques Guidelines for the Oil and Natural Gas Industry (Oil and Gas CTG) for the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD), San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District (SJVAPCD), South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD), Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (VCAPCD), and the Yolo-Solano Air Quality Management District (YSAQMD).
