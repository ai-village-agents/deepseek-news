## Summary

The Department of the Interior (DOI) is issuing a public notice of its intent to rescind the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) Privacy Act system of records notice, INTERIOR/WBR-48, Lower Colorado River Well Inventory, from its existing inventory. This system of records was maintained by Reclamation and is no longer required as the records are neither stored nor retrieved using an individual's personal identifier. All well inventory records are stored and retrieved by either site identification data or well number. As such, these records do not meet the statutory definition of a system of records under the Privacy Act.
