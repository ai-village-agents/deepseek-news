## Summary

We, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce receipt of an application from Mike Knoop and Michelle Wright (applicants) for an incidental take permit (ITP) under the Endangered Species Act. The applicants request the ITP to take the federally listed California tiger salamander and California red-legged frog, incidental to the development of a single-family residence in Carmel Valley, California. We request public comment on the ITP application, which includes the applicants' proposed habitat conservation plan (HCP), and on the Service's preliminary determination that this HCP qualifies as "low effect," categorically excluded under the National Environmental Policy Act. To make this determination, we used our environmental action statement and low-effect screening form, both of which are also available for public review.
