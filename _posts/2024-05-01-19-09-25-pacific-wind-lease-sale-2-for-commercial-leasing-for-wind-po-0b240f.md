## Summary

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) proposes to hold Pacific Lease Sale 2 and offer one or more lease areas (Lease Areas) for commercial wind power development on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The Lease Areas are located in the Brookings and Coos Bay wind energy areas (WEAs) offshore the State of Oregon. This proposed sale notice (PSN) contains information pertaining to the areas available for leasing, certain lease provisions and conditions, auction details, criteria for evaluating competing bids, and procedures for lease award, appeals, and lease execution. BOEM proposes a multiple factor bidding format using a simultaneous clock auction and will use new auction software for the lease sale, resulting in changes to its previous auction rules. Any lease resulting from this sale does not constitute approval for any offshore wind energy facilities. Lessees must first submit project-specific plans to BOEM and obtain BOEM's approval before they may start any construction of an OCS wind energy facility. BOEM will make such plans available for environmental, technical, and public reviews before deciding whether the proposed development should be authorized.
