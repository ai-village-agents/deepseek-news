## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to disapprove a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Wyoming on May 14, 2020, and supplemented in September and October 2020, addressing regional haze ("Wyoming's 2020 SIP revision"). Wyoming's 2020 SIP revision reverses the State's 2011 decision that emission limits consistent with the installation of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) for the Jim Bridger power plant, Units 1 and 2, are necessary to make reasonable progress under the State's long-term strategy for the first regional haze planning period. The SIP revision contains a source-specific nitrogen oxide (NO<INF>X</INF>) reasonable progress analysis and determination that currently installed controls (low-NO<INF>X</INF> burners with separated overfire air (LNB/SOFA)) are sufficient for reasonable progress during the first planning period for Jim Bridger Units 1 and 2, and that the emission limits associated with the installation of SCR are no longer necessary. The SIP revision also contains plant-wide monthly and annual NO<INF>X</INF> and sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) emission limits for the Jim Bridger power plant, Units 1-4. EPA is proposing to disapprove this SIP revision in full. The agency is proposing this action pursuant to sections 110 and 169A of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
