## Summary

OSHA is considering rulemaking to revise its standards for occupational exposure to lead based on medical findings since the issuance of OSHA's lead standards that adverse health effects in adults can occur at Blood Lead Levels (BLLs) lower than the medical removal level (>=60 [mu]g/dL in general industry, >=50 [mu]g/dL in construction) and lower than the level required under current standards for an employee to return to their former job status (<40 [mu]g/dL).\1\ The agency is seeking input on reducing the current BLL triggers in the medical surveillance and medical removal protection provisions of the general industry and construction standards for lead. The agency is also seeking input about how current ancillary provisions in the lead standards can be modified to reduce worker BLLs. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
