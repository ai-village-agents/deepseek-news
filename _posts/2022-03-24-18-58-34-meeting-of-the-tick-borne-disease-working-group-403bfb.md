## Summary

As required by the Federal Advisory Committee Act, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is hereby giving notice that the Tick-Borne Disease Working Group (TBDWG) will hold a virtual meeting. The meeting will be open to the public. For this meeting, the TBDWG will be discussing and voting on recommendations for the 2022 TBDWG Report to the HHS Secretary and Congress. Most of the recommendations the TBDWG will consider are from the reports of five TBDWG subcommittees, which were created to examine critical topic areas related to tick-borne diseases. The 2022 report will address a wide range of topics related to tick-borne diseases, such as, surveillance, prevention, diagnosis, diagnostics, and treatment; identify advances made in research, as well as overlap and gaps in tick-borne disease research; and provide recommendations regarding any appropriate changes or improvements to such activities and research.
