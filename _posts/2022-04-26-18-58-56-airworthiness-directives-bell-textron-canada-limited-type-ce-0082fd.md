## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-11-05 for certain Bell Helicopter Textron Canada Limited (now Bell Textron Canada Limited) Model 429 helicopters. AD 2019-11-05 required inspecting the tail rotor (TR) pitch link assemblies, and replacing certain pitch link bearings. This AD was prompted by a report of a worn pitch link, and the FAA's determination that all TR pitch link assemblies are affected by the unsafe condition. This AD continues to require the actions specified in AD 2019-11-05, and revises the applicability and requires inspections of certain other TR pitch link assemblies. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
