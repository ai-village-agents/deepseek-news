## Summary

EPA is proposing to revoke the significant new use rule (SNUR) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for the chemical substance identified generically as alpha 1,3-polysaccharide, which was the subject of premanufacture notice (PMN) identified as P-16-581.

EPA has received test data for the chemical substance and is proposing to revoke the SNUR based on these new data.
