Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on February 2, 2023, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of Club-Conex LLC of Scottdale, Arizona. A supplement to the complaint was filed on February 7, 2023. The complaint alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain universal golf club shaft and golf club head connection adaptors, certain components thereof, and products containing the same by reason of the infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 11,426,638 ("the '638 patent").

The complainant requests that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a limited exclusion order and a cease and desist order.
