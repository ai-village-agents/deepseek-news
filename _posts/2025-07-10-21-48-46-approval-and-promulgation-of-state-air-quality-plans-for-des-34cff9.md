## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is notifying the public that we have received CAA section 111(d)/129 negative declarations from Oklahoma for existing incinerators subject to the Other Solid Waste Incineration units (OSWI), Hospital/Medical/ Infectious Waste Incinerator units (HMIWI), and Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units (CISWI) Emission Guidelines (EG). These negative declarations certify that existing incinerators subject to the OSWI, HMIWI, and CISWI EG and the requirements of sections 111(d) and 129 of the CAA do not exist within specified jurisdictions in Oklahoma. The EPA is proposing to accept the negative declarations and amend the agency regulations in accordance with the requirements of the CAA. In addition, EPA is withdrawing its prior proposed approval of the Oklahoma CISWI plan revision due to Oklahoma's submission of its negative declaration for incinerators subject to the CISWI EG and its withdrawal of the CISWI plan revision.
