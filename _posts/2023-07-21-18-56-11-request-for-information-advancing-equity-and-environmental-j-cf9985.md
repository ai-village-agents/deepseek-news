## Summary

In May 2023, NMFS finalized its first-ever national Equity and Environmental Justice Strategy. The national strategy describes the path the agency will take to incorporate equity and environmental justice into the vital services we provide to all communities. Through this Request for Information, we are seeking stakeholder input to inform the operationalization of the national strategy in the Southeast Region. The public input we receive in response to the questions listed in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section of this document will inform the development of a Southeast Equity and Environmental Justice Implementation Plan that is specific and responsive to the needs of underserved communities in the U.S. Caribbean, South Atlantic, and Gulf of Mexico.
