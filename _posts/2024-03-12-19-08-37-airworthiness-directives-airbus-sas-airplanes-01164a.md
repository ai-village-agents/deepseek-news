## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of corrosion on lavatory floor fittings at various locations. This AD requires repetitive general visual inspections of the affected parts, applicable corrective actions, and reporting of the inspection results, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
