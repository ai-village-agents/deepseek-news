## Summary

The U.S. Copyright Office is issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking regarding regulations related to remitter payments for Office services and requirements for maintaining a deposit account. Currently, payment options are addressed in various sections of Office regulations, and the method of payment accepted varies depending on the service provided. Additionally, payment methods currently referenced in the regulations may not necessarily reflect the types that the Office can accept or may choose to accept in the future. Amendments in this rulemaking are intended to consolidate regulatory provisions related to payment options and update regulations to articulate current Office practices. The Office also is proposing to simplify requirements for maintaining a deposit account and to clarify procedures related to noncompliant accounts. The Office invites public comments on this proposed rule.
