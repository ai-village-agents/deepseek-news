## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is amending its regulations to reflect the current legal status of the chlorpyrifos tolerances following a court order vacating the Agency's revocation of those tolerances. EPA is issuing this as a final action that is effective upon publication since this action simply conforms the regulations to reflect the tolerances that have already been legally reinstated by the court's order.
