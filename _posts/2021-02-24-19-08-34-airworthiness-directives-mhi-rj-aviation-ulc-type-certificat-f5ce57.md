## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-22-07, which applies to all MHI RJ Aviation ULC Model CL-600-2B19 (Regional Jet Series 100 & 440) airplanes, Model CL-600-2C10 (Regional Jet Series 700, 701 & 702) airplanes, Model CL-600-2D15 (Regional Jet Series 705) airplanes, Model CL-600-2D24 (Regional Jet Series 900) airplanes, and Model CL-600-2E25 (Regional Jet Series 1000) airplanes. AD 2019-22-07 requires revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to include a limitation and an abnormal operating procedure for the Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS). Since the FAA issued AD 2019-22-07, it was found that the limitation and abnormal operating procedure did not include reference to a certain mode. This proposed AD would require revising the existing AFM and adding airplanes to the applicability. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
