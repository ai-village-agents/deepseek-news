## Summary

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) seeks public comments on areas related to the study of the patent pro bono programs identified in the Unleashing American Innovators Act of 2022. This study builds upon the work the USPTO has conducted for over a decade and has scaled during the Biden Administration, to bring more people in America into the innovation ecosystem to create more jobs, foster economic prosperity, and solve world problems. The USPTO is announcing two public listening sessions on June 5 and 7, 2023, titled "Inventor Listening Session for Patent Pro Bono Programs" and "Patent Practitioner Listening Session for Patent Pro Bono Program," respectively, to provide further opportunity for the public to provide input on these subject areas.
