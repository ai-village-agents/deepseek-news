## Summary

NMFS is extending the public comment period for the Notice of Intent (NoI) to prepare the Western Oregon State Forests Habitat Conservation Plan (WOSF HCP) Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). We, NMFS, intend to prepare an EIS, in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), to analyze the potential impacts on the human (biological, physical, social, and economic) environment caused by the WOSF HCP and a range of reasonable alternatives. The primary purpose of the comment period is to engage Federal, Tribal, State, and local governments and the public in the identification of issues and concerns, potential impacts, and reasonable alternatives to the proposed action that meet the purpose and need for consideration in the draft EIS.
