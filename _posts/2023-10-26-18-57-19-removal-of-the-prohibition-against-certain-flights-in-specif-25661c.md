## Summary

This action removes the current flight prohibition Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) for specified areas of the Dnipro Flight Information Region (FIR) (UKDV). This SFAR, which is scheduled to expire on October 27, 2023, reflects risks to the safety of U.S. civil aviation as they existed prior to the Russian Federation's full- scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and is therefore obsolete. This action is necessary to alleviate confusion that might otherwise result from leaving an obsolete rule in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) after its scheduled expiration date of October 27, 2023. FAA Notice-to-Air-Missions (NOTAM) KICZ A0004/22 remains in effect and continues to prohibit U.S. civil flight operations in the Lviv (UKLV), Kyiv (UKBV), Dnipro (UKDV), Simferopol (UKFV), and Odesa (UKOV) FIRs, as well as the Kyiv Upper Information Region (UIR) (UKBU). NOTAM KICZ A0004/22, together with NOTAMs KICZ A0003/22 and A0005/22, reflects the FAA's current assessment of the safety-of-flight risks the Russia- Ukraine conflict presents to U.S. civil aviation operations.
