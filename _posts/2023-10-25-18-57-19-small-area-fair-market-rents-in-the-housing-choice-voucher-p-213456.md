## Summary

In 2016, HUD completed a final rule requiring the use of Small Area Fair Market Rents (SAFMRs) in certain metropolitan areas to use in the administration of the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program. These areas were based on certain selection criteria and values. These criteria are: at least 2,500 HCVs must be under lease in the metropolitan FMR area; at least 20 percent of the standard quality rental stock within the metropolitan FMR area is in small areas (ZIP codes) where the Small Area FMR is more than 110 percent of the metropolitan FMR; the percentage of voucher families living in concentrated low-income areas within the area must be at least 25 percent; the measure of the percentage of voucher holders living in concentrated low-income areas relative to all renters within these areas over the entire metropolitan area exceeds 155 percent (or 1.55); and the vacancy rate for the metropolitan area is higher than 4 percent. This notice lists the metropolitan areas that will be subject to Small Area FMRs based on the final rule's requirement that HUD "make new area designations every 5 years thereafter as new data becomes available."
