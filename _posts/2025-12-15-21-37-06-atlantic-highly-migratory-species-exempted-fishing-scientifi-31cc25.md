## Summary

NMFS announces its intent to issue exempted fishing permits (EFPs), scientific research permits (SRPs), display permits, shark research fishery permits, and letters of acknowledgement (LOAs) for Atlantic highly migratory species (HMS) in 2026. NMFS also requests applications for the 2026 shark research fishery. EFPs, SRPs, display permits, and shark research fishery permits exempt permit holders from specific portions of the regulations for the purposes of scientific research, data collection, and public display, among other things. The shark research fishery provides fishery-dependent and biological data collection to support stock assessments and other NMFS research and management objectives. LOAs acknowledge that researchers are conducting scientific research activities on board a scientific research vessel. Generally, exempted fishing and related permits are valid from the date of issuance through the end of the calendar year for which they are issued, unless otherwise specified in the permit, subject to the terms and conditions of individual permits.
