## Summary

This action proposes special conditions for a supplemental type certificate (STC) to install a helicopter hoist equipped with an overload protection device (OLPD) on Sikorsky Model S-61A, S-61L, and S-61N (including those modified by STC No. SH640NE, which shortens the S-61N by 50 inches) helicopters. These helicopters, as modified by Carson Helicopters, Inc. (Carson), will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport category rotorcraft. This design feature is an OLPD installed in the hoist. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These proposed special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
