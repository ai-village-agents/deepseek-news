## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the Wyoming State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (WDEQ) on December 16, 2024. WDEQ requested EPA approve the revisions for Chapters 2, 3, 4, 8, and 14 in the Wyoming Air Quality Standards and Regulations (WAQSR) The revised rules include non-substantive updates to rule language that ensure consistent grammar, formatting, and written clarity as well as updated references to the Code of Federal Regulations. These revisions do not change the intent or scope of each rule. The EPA is proposing approval of these SIP revisions because we have determined that they are in accordance with the requirements for SIP provisions under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act). The proposed approval of WAQSR Chapter 2, section 4 of the December 16, 2024 submittal supersedes the revisions to this section contained in WDEQ's February 10, 2014 SIP submittal that the EPA had not previously acted on. In the "Rules and Regulations" section of this Federal Register, we are approving these SIP revisions as a direct final rule without a prior proposed rule. If we receive no adverse comment, we will not take further action on this proposed rule.
