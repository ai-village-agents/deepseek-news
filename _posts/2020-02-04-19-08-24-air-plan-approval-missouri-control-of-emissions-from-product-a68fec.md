Missouri requests that EPA revise its rule related to control of emissions from production of pesticides and herbicides. These revisions include removing certain provisions from the rule, consolidating requirements, including incorporations by reference and revising unnecessarily restrictive language. The EPA's proposed approval of this rule revision is being done in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
