## Summary

On October 8, 2024, in the consolidated appeal of Worldwide Door Components, Inc., v. United States, Endura Products, INC., Court No. 2023-1532 and Columbia Aluminum Products, LLC, v. United States, Endura Products, INC., Court No. 2023-1534 (collectively, Worldwide Federal Circuit), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) reversed the U.S. Court of International Trade's (CIT) Second Remand Order, and sustained the non-protested portions of Commerce's First Remand Redeterminations. The Federal Circuit also vacated the CIT's subsequent opinions and orders in this case following the Second Remand Order. In the First Remand Redeterminations, Commerce continued to find that certain door thresholds imported by Worldwide Door Components, Inc. (Worldwide) and Columbia Aluminum Products, Inc. (Columbia) are within the scope of the antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on aluminum extrusions from the People's Republic of China (China). The CIT originally sustained Commerce's Third Remand Redeterminations finding the products in question outside the scope of the Orders under respectful protest, and on December 29, 2022, Commerce published a notice of court decisions not in harmony with its final scope ruling and notice of amended final scope ruling. However, consistent with the Federal Circuit's decision reversing and vacating the CIT's opinion and order, Commerce is now amending the final scope rulings, as they were represented in the Amended Final Scope Rulings, to find that the Worldwide and Columbia door thresholds at issue are subject to the Orders.
