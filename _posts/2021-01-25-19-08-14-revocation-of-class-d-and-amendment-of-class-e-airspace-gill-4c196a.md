## Summary

This action removes the Class D airspace, establishes a Class E surface area, modifies the Class E airspace as an extension to the surface area and modifies the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet AGL at Northeast Wyoming Regional Airport, Gillette, WY. In addition, this action removes the VOR/DME from the legal description and replaces the outdated term Airport Facility/Directory with the term Chart Supplement. It also makes two minor administrative corrections noted in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM); the airport name is updated and the Class E surface area is identified as new airspace rather than amended airspace. After being informed that the Airport Traffic Control Tower at Northeast Wyoming Regional Airport is closed permanently, the FAA found it necessary to create new airspace and amend the existing airspace for the safety and management of Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) operations at this airport.
