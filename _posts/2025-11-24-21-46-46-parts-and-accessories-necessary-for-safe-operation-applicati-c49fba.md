## Summary

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) requests public comment on an application for a 5-year exemption submitted by Atlantic Aviation Orlando, LLC (Atlantic). Atlantic seeks an exemption from 49 CFR 393.83(e), which requires the exhaust system on certain commercial motor vehicles to discharge at or near the rear of the cab. The exemption would allow Atlantic's jet-fueler trucks to discharge exhaust forward of the cab when operating on public roads. FMCSA requests public comment on Atlantic's application.
