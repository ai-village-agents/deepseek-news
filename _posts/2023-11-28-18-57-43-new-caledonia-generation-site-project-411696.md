## Summary

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) intends to prepare an environmental assessment (EA) or an environmental impact statement (EIS) under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to address the potential environmental impacts associated with the proposed construction and operation of a Combustion Turbine (CT) Plant on a parcel of TVA-owned brownfield property in Lowndes County, Mississippi. The proposed New Caledonia Generation Site (NCG) would provide approximately 500 Megawatts (MW) of new generation capacity. The NCG CTs would be composed of six (6) natural gas-fired frame CTs. NCG would provide flexible and dispatchable transmission grid support and facilitate the integration of renewable generation onto the TVA bulk transmission system, consistent with the 2019 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP). Public comment is invited concerning the scope of the environmental review, alternatives being considered, and environmental issues that should be addressed. TVA is also requesting data, information, and analysis relevant to the proposed action from the public; affected Federal, State, Tribal, and local governments, agencies, and offices; the scientific community; industry; or any other interested party.
