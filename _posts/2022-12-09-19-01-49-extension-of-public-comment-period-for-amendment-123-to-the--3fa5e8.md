## Summary

On November 9, 2022, the National Marine Fisheries Service published a Notice of Availability and request for comments on Amendment 123 to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area (BSAI FMP), but inadvertently did not include the supporting Amendment text. With this notice, NMFS is extending the public comment period by 60 days to February 7, 2023, to afford the public with additional time to provide comments on Amendment 123.
