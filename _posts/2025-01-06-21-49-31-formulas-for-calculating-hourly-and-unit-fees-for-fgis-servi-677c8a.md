## Summary

The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS or Service) is amending its user fee regulations to establish standardized formulas the agency will use to calculate hourly and unit fees. The changes allow FGIS to charge reasonable fees sufficient to cover the costs of providing official services and re-establish a 3-to 6-month operating reserve, as required by the United States Grain Standards Act (USGSA). This final rule also makes specified conforming changes and minor technical changes to correct two typographical errors.
