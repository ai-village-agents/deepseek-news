# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus SAS Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A330-841 and -941 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of missing or disbonded pressure seals on two thrust reverser (TR) translating cowls. This proposed AD would require a one-time inspection of each thrust reverser for damage, seal bonding rework, and replacement of translating cowl pressure seals if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
