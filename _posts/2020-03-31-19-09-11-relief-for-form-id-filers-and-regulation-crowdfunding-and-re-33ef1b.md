We are adopting temporary final rules for Form ID filers and for issuers subject to reporting obligations pursuant to Regulation Crowdfunding and Regulation A in order to address the needs of companies directly or indirectly affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The temporary final rules provide temporary relief from the Form ID notarization process for certain filers and extend the filing deadlines for specified reports and forms due pursuant to Regulation Crowdfunding and Regulation A for certain issuers.
