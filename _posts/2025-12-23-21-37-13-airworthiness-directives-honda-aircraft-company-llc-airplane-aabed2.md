## Summary

The FAA is revising a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that would have applied to certain Honda Aircraft Company LLC (Honda) Model HA-420 airplanes. This action revises the NPRM by updating the referenced service material to a new revision that includes redesigned replacement flap control pushrod assemblies that have been modified to prevent interference with adjacent parts. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive (AD) to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over those in the NPRM, the agency is requesting comments on this SNPRM.
