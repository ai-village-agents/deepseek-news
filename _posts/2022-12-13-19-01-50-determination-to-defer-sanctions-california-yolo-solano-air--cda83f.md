## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is making an interim final determination that the California Air Resources Board has submitted a revised rule on behalf of the Yolo-Solano Air Quality Management District (YSAQMD) that corrects a deficiency in its Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) State implementation plan (SIP) provisions concerning reasonably available control technology (RACT) ozone nonattainment requirements for controlling emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) from solvent cleaning and degreasing operations. This determination is based on a proposed approval, published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, of YSAQMD's Rule 2.31, which regulates this source category. The effect of this interim final determination is that the imposition of sanctions that was triggered by a prior disapproval by the EPA, is now deferred. If the EPA finalizes its approval of YSAQMD 's submission, relief from these sanctions will become permanent.
