## Summary

On January 23, 2018, the President imposed a safeguard measure on imports of certain solar products pursuant to a Section 201 investigation. On February 14, 2018, the U.S. Trade Representative established procedures for interested persons to request product- specific exclusions from application of the safeguard measure and comment on the submitted requests. Based on the requests and comments received, the U.S. Trade Representative granted certain requests on June 13, 2019, including a request to exclude from the safeguard measure bifacial solar panels that consist only of bifacial solar cells. This notice establishes procedures for interested persons to submit comments, and respond to comments, on whether the U.S. Trade Representative should maintain the exclusion of bifacial solar panels from the safeguard measure, withdraw the exclusion, or take some other action within his authority with respect to this exclusion.
