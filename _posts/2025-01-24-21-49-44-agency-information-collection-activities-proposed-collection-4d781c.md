## Summary

The FTC is soliciting public comments on proposed information requests to large-scale Single-Family Rental (SFR) owner operators, known as mega investors. Mega SFR investors are those entities that own over 1,000 single-family rental properties. These comments will be considered before the FTC submits a request for Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review of the compulsory process orders described in this notice under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). The compulsory process orders will seek information from those firms concerning their corporate structure, current and historical housing inventory information, as well as strategic business plans and other investor information regarding growth plans, competition, prices, and expenses.
