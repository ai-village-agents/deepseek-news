## Summary

NMFS proposes regulations to implement management measures described in Amendment 32 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Coastal Migratory Pelagic (CMP) Resources of the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Region (CMP FMP), as prepared and submitted by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council and the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Councils). This proposed rule and Amendment 32 would revise the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) migratory group of cobia (Gulf group cobia) catch limits, possession limit and minimum size limits, establish a Gulf group cobia commercial trip limit and recreational vessel limit, and revise the CMP FMP framework procedures. The proposed rule would also clarify the Gulf group cobia sale and purchase restrictions. The purpose of this proposed rule and Amendment 32 is to end overfishing of Gulf group cobia, update catch limits to be consistent with the best scientific information available, and revise management measures to help constrain landings to the catch limits.
