## Summary

This document amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regulations to reflect an extension of import restrictions on certain archaeological and ecclesiastical ethnological material from Colombia. The restrictions, which were originally imposed by CBP Dec. 06-09 and last extended by CBP Dec. 16-05, are due to expire on March 15, 2021. The Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States Department of State, has made the requisite determinations for extending the import restrictions that previously existed, and the Government of the United States and the Government of Colombia entered into a new agreement to reflect the extension of these import restrictions. The new agreement, which enters into force on March 10, 2021, supersedes the existing Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that became effective on March 15, 2006, and enabled the promulgation of the existing import restrictions. Accordingly, the import restrictions will remain in effect for an additional five years, and the CBP regulations are being amended to reflect this further extension until March 10, 2026. CBP Dec. 06-09 contains the amended Designated List of archaeological and ecclesiastical ethnological material from Colombia to which the restrictions apply.
