## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration is proposing to establish criteria for the lists of drug products or categories of drug products that present demonstrable difficulties for compounding (Demonstrable Difficulties for Compounding Lists or DDC Lists) under certain sections of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Additionally, the Agency is proposing to identify the first three categories of drug products on both DDC Lists. Drug products or categories of drug products that appear on the DDC Lists cannot qualify for certain statutory exemptions, and therefore may not be compounded under, either section 503A or section 503B, respectively.
