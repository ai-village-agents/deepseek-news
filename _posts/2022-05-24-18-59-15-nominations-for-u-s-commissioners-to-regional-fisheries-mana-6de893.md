## Summary

NMFS is soliciting nominations, which may include self- nominations, for qualified individuals to serve as non-Federal U.S. Commissioners (Commissioners) to certain regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs). This action is being undertaken to enhance transparency in the process of identifying potential candidates for Commissioner positions and to increase diversity in the candidate pool to help ensure the views and interests of the range of U.S. stakeholders are considered in the process of developing and advancing U.S. positions at RFMOs. Nominations are open to all qualified individuals and may include current or previous Commissioners and Alternate Commissioners for certain RFMOs where eligible.
