## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a November 15, 2021, redesignation request and State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of New Jersey. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) is requesting that EPA redesignate the New Jersey portion of the Northeast Pennsylvania-Upper Delaware Valley Interstate Air Quality Control Region (Warren County, New Jersey) from nonattainment to attainment for the 1971 sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). In conjunction with its redesignation request, New Jersey submitted a limited maintenance plan and its associated contingency measures for the Warren County Nonattainment Area to ensure that attainment of SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS will continue to be maintained. EPA is proposing to approve the request for redesignation and the maintenance plan based on EPA's determination that the Warren County Nonattainment Area has met the redesignation requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
