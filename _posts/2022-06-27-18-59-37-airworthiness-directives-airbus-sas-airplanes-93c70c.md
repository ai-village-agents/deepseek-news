## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-11- 03, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. AD 2022-11-03 required revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM), and revising the operator's existing FAA-approved minimum equipment list (MEL) by incorporating certain master minimum equipment list (MMEL) provisions, to include limitations and procedures to mitigate the risk of elevator failure during flare. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-11-03, an updated software standard for the PRIMary flight control computers (PRIMs) has been developed to address the unsafe condition. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2022- 11-03, and also requires installing an updated PRIM software standard, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
