## Summary

The Commission is removing the regulatory prohibition on knowingly helping or assisting any person in making a contribution in the name of another. The Commission is taking this action to implement the order of the United States District Court in FEC v. Swallow, which enjoined the Commission from enforcing the provision and ordered the Commission to strike it from the Code of Federal Regulations. The Commission is accepting comments on this revision to its regulations and any comments received may be addressed in a subsequent rulemaking document.
