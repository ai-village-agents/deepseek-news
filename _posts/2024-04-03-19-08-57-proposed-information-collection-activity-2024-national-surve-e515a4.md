## Summary

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is proposing a data collection activity to be conducted September 2024 through May 2025 as a follow-up of the 2024 National Survey of Early Care and Education (NSECE). The objectives of the 2024 NSECE Longitudinal Follow-ups are to build on the design and implementation of the 2024 NSECE to collect urgently needed information on the following two topics relevant to early care and education (ECE) policy: (1) how households learn about and make use of financial assistance in seeking and selecting ECE, with additional focus on paid individual care arrangements; and (2) patterns of retention and attrition among individuals in the center-based ECE workforce.
