## Summary

The Gifford Pinchot National Forest is proposing to charge new fees at multiple recreation sites listed in SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION of this notice. Funds from fees would be used for operation, maintenance, and improvements of these recreation sites. Many sites have recently been reconstructed or amenities are being added to improve services and experiences. An analysis of nearby developed recreation sites with similar amenities shows the proposed fees are reasonable and typical of similar sites in the area.
