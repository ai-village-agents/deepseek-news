## Summary

This action serves as notice that NMFS has determined, after review consistent with NMFS' small business size standards regulations, the U.S. Small Business Administration's review requirements under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, the Small Business Administration's regulations establishing size standards, and Small Business Administration's size standards methodology, the NMFS-established and codified single small business size standard of $11 million in annual gross receipts for all businesses in the commercial fishing industry continues to reflect the size distribution of all businesses in the commercial fishing industry and is appropriate for continued use for Regulatory Flexibility Act purposes only. Therefore, no revision to the standard is warranted at this time.
