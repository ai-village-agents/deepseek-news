## Summary

This notice requests information from interested parties to assist the agency to develop and implement a new discretionary grant program to increase the number of States, U.S. territories, and Indian tribes electronically transferring their motor vehicle crash data to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), enacted as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), establishes a new program called the State electronic data collection program. Specifically, section 24108(d)(2) mandates that NHTSA provide grants to States to upgrade and standardize their State crash data systems to enable electronic data collection, intrastate data sharing, and electronic data transfers to NHTSA to increase the accuracy, timeliness, and accessibility of the data including data relating to fatalities involving vulnerable road users. Ultimately, the grants will support an increased capacity of the NHTSA data systems, including the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), the Crash Reporting Sampling System (CRSS), and the Crash Investigation Sampling System (CISS), and make State crash data accessible to the public. NHTSA seeks comments from all interested parties, including State crash data owners, highway safety offices, law enforcement, and other stakeholders to help inform NHTSA's development of a grant program. This grant program is to modernize State data collection systems and to enable full electronic data transfer. All comments should be submitted via docket number NHTSA-2022-0030.
