## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500- 1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report from the supplier of a manufacturing quality escape in which some sensing elements were manufactured with insufficient salt fill. This could result in an inability to detect hot bleed air leaks. This AD requires, depending on airplane serial number, reviewing the airplane maintenance records for affected bleed leak detection system sensing elements, testing the sensing elements, replacing those that fail, and witness marking those that pass, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also prohibits the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
