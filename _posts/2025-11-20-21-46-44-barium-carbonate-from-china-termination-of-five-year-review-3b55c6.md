## Summary

The Commission instituted the subject five-year review on July 1, 2025 to determine whether revocation of the antidumping duty order on barium carbonate from China would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury. On October 3, 2025, the Department of Commerce published notice in the Federal Register that it was revoking the order effective August 20, 2025, because no domestic interested party filed a timely notice of intent to participate. Accordingly, the subject review is terminated.
