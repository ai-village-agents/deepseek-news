## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a Regulated Navigation Area over certain navigable waters of the Biscayne Bay Causeway Island Slip, immediately west of the Coast Guard Base Miami Beach, Miami Beach, FL. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life and federal property on this navigable water. This proposed rulemaking would require all persons and vessels to transit the Regulated Navigation Area at a speed that creates minimum wake, seven miles per hour or less, to safeguard damage to Coast Guard assets, disrupting operations, and/or injuring Coast Guard personnel. Additionally, this proposed rulemaking would prohibit vessels from passing other vessels making way within the regulated area. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
