## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) is announcing an extension to the comment period for the proposed rule requiring an owner or operator of a facility to prepare and submit a plan for responding, to the maximum extent practicable, to a worst case discharge, and to a substantial threat of such a discharge, of a hazardous substance published in the Federal Register on March 28, 2022. EPA is proposing to require planning for worst case discharges of Clean Water Act (CWA) hazardous substances for onshore non- transportation-related facilities that could reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm to the environment by discharging CWA hazardous substances into or on the navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or exclusive economic zone. The comment period is being extended to July 26, 2022.
