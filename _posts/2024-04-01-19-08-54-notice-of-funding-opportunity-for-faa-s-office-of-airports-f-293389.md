FAA will implement the FY 2023 Supplemental Discretionary grants consistent with AIP sponsor and project eligibility. In addition, FY 2023 Supplemental Discretionary grants will align with DOT's Strategic Framework FY 2022-2026 at https:// www.transportation.gov/administrations/office-policy/fy2022-2026- strategic-framework.
