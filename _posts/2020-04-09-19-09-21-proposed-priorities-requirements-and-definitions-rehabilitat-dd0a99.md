The Assistant Secretary for Special Education and Rehabilitative Services proposes priorities, requirements, and definitions to fund a Vocational Rehabilitation Technical Assistance Center for Quality Management (VRTAC-QM) and a Vocational Rehabilitation Technical Assistance Center for Quality Employment (VRTAC-QE), Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) numbers 84.264J and 84.264K. The Assistant Secretary may use these priorities, requirements, and definitions for competitions in fiscal year (FY) 2020 and later years. We take this action to focus Federal financial assistance on identified national needs and to improve employment outcomes under the Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) program and raise expectations for all people with disabilities. We intend the VRTAC-QM to provide training and technical assistance to State VR agencies that will better enable VR personnel to manage available resources, improve effective service delivery, and increase the number and quality of employment outcomes for individuals with disabilities. We intend the VRTAC-QE to provide training and technical assistance to State VR agencies that will better enable VR personnel, especially VR counselors, to implement innovative and effective VR and employment strategies and practices to increase the number and quality of employment outcomes for individuals with disabilities.
