## Summary

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 (ANILCA), as amended, along with other laws as applicable, we, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), announce availability of a Draft Environmental Assessment (draft EA) to evaluate the effects associated with an access to inholdings request under ANILCA 1110(b) from the Kaktovik I[ntilde]upiat Corporation (KIC). KIC seeks a 20-year right-of-way (ROW) permit for certain Refuge lands located between the western boundary of the Refuge and KIC's inholdings near the community of Kaktovik. The ROW permit would enable KIC to annually create and utilize a winter snow trail for the purpose of transporting large equipment and commodities to its inholdings. We invite comment on the draft EA from the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies.
