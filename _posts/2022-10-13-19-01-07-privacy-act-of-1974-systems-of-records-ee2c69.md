## Summary

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Office of Inspector General (OIG) proposes to amend its systems of records by modifying six existing routine uses, adding one new routine use applicable to all systems of records, and making technical changes and corrections to its existing system of records notices. Based on these amendments, and to conform all system of records notices to the template prescribed by the Office of the Federal Register and the Office of Management and Budget, USDA OIG is re-publishing all of its system of records notices in their entirety.
