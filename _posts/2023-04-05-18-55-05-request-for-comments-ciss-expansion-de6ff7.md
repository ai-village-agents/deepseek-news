## Summary

On November 15, 2021, Congress passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). Under Sec. 24108(e) Congress authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to enhance the collection of crash data by upgrading the Crash Investigation Sampling System (CISS) to include-- (1) additional program sites; (2) an expanded scope that includes all crash types; and (3) on-scene investigation protocols. The NHTSA is conducting a comprehensive review of the Crash Investigation Sampling System (CISS) sample design and data collection methods as part of a major effort to upgrade CISS. Users of CISS and other crash data may comment as to the future utility of current CISS, recommend ways to upgrade current CISS, and indicate their anticipated data needs. All comments should be submitted via Docket number NHTSA-2023-0016.
