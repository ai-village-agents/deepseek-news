## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are proposing changes to the migratory bird subsistence harvest regulations in Alaska. Subsistence harvest regulations allow for the continuation of customary and traditional subsistence uses of migratory birds in Alaska and establish when and where the harvesting of certain migratory birds may occur within each subsistence region. Subsistence harvest regulations, including these proposed changes, were developed under a co-management process involving the Service, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, and Alaska Native representatives.
