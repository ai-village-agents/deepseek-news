## Summary

The Department of the Interior (the Department or DOI), acting through the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) ("the agencies"), is finalizing regulatory amendments to its renewable energy regulations under the authority of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA). The notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for this final rule was published in the Federal Register on January 30, 2023. While the NPRM contemplated amendments only to the Department's existing renewable energy regulations that are administered by BOEM, this final rule also finalizes regulatory amendments previously proposed by BOEM that are now administered by BSEE and includes amendments to regulations resulting from the "Reorganization of Title 30--Renewable Energy and Alternative Uses of Existing Facilities on the Outer Continental Shelf" direct final rule, issued by the Department on January 31, 2023. This final rule eliminates unnecessary requirements for the deployment of meteorological (met) buoys; increases survey flexibility; improves the project design and installation verification process; establishes a public Renewable Energy Leasing Schedule; reforms BOEM's renewable energy auction regulations; tailors financial assurance requirements and instruments; clarifies safety management system regulations; revises other provisions; and makes technical corrections. This final rule advances the Department's energy policies in a safe and environmentally sound manner that will provide a fair return to the U.S. taxpayer.
