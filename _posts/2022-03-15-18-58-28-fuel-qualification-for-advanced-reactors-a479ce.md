## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing NUREG- 2246, "Fuel Qualification for Advanced Reactors." The purpose of this NUREG report is to provide a fuel qualification assessment framework for use by applicants for proposed advanced reactors using fuel designs and operating environments that differ from traditional light water reactor fuel. Specifically, the framework provides objective criteria, derived from regulatory requirements, that when satisfied, would support regulatory findings for licensing.
