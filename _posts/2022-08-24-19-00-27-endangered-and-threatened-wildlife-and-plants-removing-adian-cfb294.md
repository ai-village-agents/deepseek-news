## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are removing the plant Adiantum vivesii (no common name) from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Plants (List). This determination is based on a thorough review of the best available scientific and commercial data indicating that Adiantum vivesii is not a distinct species, but rather a sterile hybrid that does not have the capacity to establish a lineage that could be lost to extinction. Here, we have determined that Adiantum vivesii is not a discrete taxonomic entity and does not meet the definition of a species as defined under the Act, and that its original listing was based on data or interpretations of data that were in error; therefore, we are delisting it.
