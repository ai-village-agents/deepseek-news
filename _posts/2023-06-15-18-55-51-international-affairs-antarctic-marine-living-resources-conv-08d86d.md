## Summary

NMFS announces the reopening of the public comment period for 15 days on the proposed rule to revise its Antarctic Marine Living Resources Convention Act regulations that implement the trade- monitoring program for frozen and fresh Dissostichus species, commonly marketed or referred to as Chilean seabass or Patagonian toothfish. The original 30-day comment period ended on June 5, 2023. We received comments in the final days of the comment period requesting an extension. We are therefore reopening the comment period from June 15, 2023 to June 30, 2023 to allow more time for submittal of public comments. Comments previously submitted need not be resubmitted.
