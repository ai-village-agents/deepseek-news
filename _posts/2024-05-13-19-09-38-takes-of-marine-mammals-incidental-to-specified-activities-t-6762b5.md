## Summary

In accordance with the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), as amended, its implementing regulations, and NMFS' MMPA Regulations for Taking Marine Mammals Incidental to Construction of the Revolution Wind Project Offshore of Rhode Island, notification is hereby given that upon request from Revolution Wind, LLC (Revolution Wind), NMFS has modified a Letter of Authorization (LOA) issued to Revolution Wind for the take of marine mammals incidental to activities associated with construction of the Revolution Wind Offshore Wind Energy Project (hereafter known as the "Project") in Federal and State waters offshore Rhode Island. Specifically, NMFS has removed the requirement that each real-time passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data stream must be monitored by separate PAM operators. NMFS has determined that this modification to the aforementioned monitoring requirement does not change the findings made for the regulations and does not result in any change in the total estimated number of takes of marine mammals.
