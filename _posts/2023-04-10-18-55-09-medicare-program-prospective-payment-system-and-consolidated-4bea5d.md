# Medicare Program; Prospective Payment System and Consolidated Billing for Skilled Nursing Facilities; Updates to the Quality Reporting Program and Value-Based Purchasing Program for Federal Fiscal Year 2024

## Summary

This proposed rule would update payment rates, including implementing the second phase of the Patient Driven Payment Model (PDPM) parity adjustment recalibration. This proposed rule also proposes updates to the diagnosis code mappings used under PDPM, the SNF Quality Reporting Program (QRP), and the SNF Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program. We are also proposing to eliminate the requirement for facilities to actively waive their right to a hearing in writing, instead treating the failure to submit a timely request for a hearing as a constructive waiver.
