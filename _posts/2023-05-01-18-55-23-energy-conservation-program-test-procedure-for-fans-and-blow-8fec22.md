## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") establishes a test procedure for fans and blowers, including air circulating fans, and incorporates by reference the relevant industry test standards for: measuring the fan electrical input power and determining the fan energy index of fans and blowers other than air-circulating fans; and measuring the fan airflow in cubic feet per minute per watt of electric power input of air-circulating fans. In this final rule, DOE also establishes supporting definitions, requirements for alternative efficiency determination methods, and sampling requirements.
