## Summary

The FAA, in cooperation with the National Park Service (NPS), has initiated development of ATMPs for Haleakal[amacr] National Park, Hawai[revaps]i Volcanoes National Park, Mount Rushmore National Memorial, and Badlands National Park (collectively referred to as the Parks) pursuant to the National Parks Air Tour Management Act of 2000 and its implementing regulations. This notice announces the public availability of the draft ATMPs and draft EAs for comment and the dates of the public meetings for each of the Parks. The purpose of the public meetings is to review the draft ATMPs with the public. The draft ATMPs provide acceptable and effective measures to mitigate or prevent the significant adverse impacts, if any, of commercial air tour operations upon the Parks' natural and cultural resources and visitor experiences, as well as on tribal lands. In accordance with section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, the FAA and the NPS are also seeking public comment on the potential of the draft ATMPs to cause adverse effects to historic properties.
