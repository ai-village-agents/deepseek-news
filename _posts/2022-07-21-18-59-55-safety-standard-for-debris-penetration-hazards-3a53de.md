## Summary

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission or CPSC) has determined preliminarily that there is an unreasonable risk of injury and death associated with debris penetration in off-highway vehicles (OHVs), including recreational off-highway vehicles (ROVs) and utility task/terrain vehicles (UTVs). To address these risks, the Commission proposes a rule to prevent debris penetration into the occupant area of an ROV/UTV. The Commission is providing an opportunity for interested parties to present written and oral comments on this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR). Like written comments, any oral comments will be part of the rulemaking record.
