## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Embraer S.A. Model EMB-545 and EMB-550 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of a hard landing event with substantial damage to the airplane, in which the angle of attack (AOA) limiter was engaged during the final approach phase in unstable air conditions and remained engaged until the airplane touched down on the runway. This AD requires revising the Limitations and Normal Procedures sections of the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to incorporate new operational airspeed limitations, and flight control limitations and approach procedures when AOA limiter protection is engaged, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also requires inspecting records for instances of AOA limiter engagement during a certain phase of flight and reporting findings to the FAA. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
