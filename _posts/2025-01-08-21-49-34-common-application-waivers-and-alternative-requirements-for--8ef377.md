## Summary

This notice contains a preamble and the Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery Universal Notice: Waivers and Alternative Requirements (the "Universal Notice"). The Universal Notice describes the processes, procedures, timelines, waivers, and alternative requirements that U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) intends to implement with each allocation of Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) funding after a qualifying presidential disaster declaration. Specifically, following the appropriation of CDBG-DR funds for qualifying disasters, HUD will publish an Allocation Announcement Notice in the Federal Register that incorporates, via cross-reference, the waivers and alternative requirements provided in the Universal Notice, as appropriate, along with any other new requirements imposed by the specific appropriation. This notice also describes the grant award process, pre-award certification submissions, criteria for Action Plan approval, and eligible disaster recovery activities to streamline post-disaster processes for future grantees. By publishing the Universal Notice, HUD intends to provide grantees and the public with increased transparency, consistency, and more timely access to CDBG-DR funds, helping to minimize program delays and accelerate recovery.
