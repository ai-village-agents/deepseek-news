## Summary

This final rule adopts a modification of the requirements for the use of the Telecommunication Standard Implementation Guide, Version D, Release 0 (Version D.0), August 2007, National Council for Prescription Drug Programs, by requiring covered entities to use the Quantity Prescribed (460-ET) field for retail pharmacy transactions for Schedule II drugs. The modification enables covered entities to distinguish whether a prescription is a "partial fill," where less than the full amount prescribed is dispensed, or a refill, where the full amount prescribed is dispensed, in the HIPAA retail pharmacy transactions. This modification is important to ensure the availability of a greater quantum of data that may help prevent impermissible refills of Schedule II drugs, which will help to address the public health concerns associated with prescription drug abuse in the United States.
