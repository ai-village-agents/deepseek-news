## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2024-23-06, which applies to certain MD Helicopters, LLC (MDHI) Model 369, 369A, 369D, 369E, 369F, 369FF, 369H, 369HE, 369HM, 369HS, 500N, and 600N helicopters. AD 2024-23-06 requires repetitively inspecting the torque tube assembly and roller bearings, and depending on the results, replacing parts or accomplishing additional inspections. Since the FAA issued AD 2024-23-06, it has been determined that additional torque tube assemblies are affected by this unsafe condition. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions of AD 2024-23-06 and would expand the applicability. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
