## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing for public comment a draft Regulatory Guide (DG), DG-1421, "Installation Design and Installation of Vented Lead-Acid Storage Batteries for Production and Utilization Facilities." This DG is proposed Revision 3 of Regulatory Guide 1.128, "Installation Design and Installation of Vented Lead-Acid Storage Batteries for Nuclear Power Plants," and provides methods acceptable to the NRC to meet regulatory requirements for the installation design and installation of vented lead-acid storage batteries in production and utilization facilities. It endorses, with clarifications, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standard (Std.) 484-2019, "IEEE Recommended Practice for Installation Design and Installation of Vented Lead-Acid Batteries for Stationary Applications."
