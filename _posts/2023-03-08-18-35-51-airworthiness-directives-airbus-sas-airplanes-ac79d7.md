## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-06-07, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A330-200 Freighter, - 200, and -300 series airplanes; and A340-200, -300, -500, and -600 series airplanes. AD 2017-06-07 requires identification of potentially affected inboard flap parts, a one-time eddy current inspection to identify which material the parts are made of, and, depending on findings, replacement with serviceable parts. Since the FAA issued AD 2017-06-07, it was determined that, even if affected inboard flaps were not installed on airplanes during production, affected inboard flaps could be installed on airplanes as spare parts. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2017-06-07, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). This proposed AD would also reduce the allowance for the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
