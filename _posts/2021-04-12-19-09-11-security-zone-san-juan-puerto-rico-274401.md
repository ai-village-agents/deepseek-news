## Summary

The Coast Guard is revising an existing, moving security zone for the Port of San Juan, San Juan, Puerto Rico. The revision expands the existing moving security zone to a 200-yard radius around all cruise ships entering, departing, or anchored in the Port of San Juan. While the cruise ships are moored at the Port of San Juan, the security zone remains a 50-yard radius around the cruise ships. This action continues to prohibit persons and vessels from entering, anchoring, mooring or transiting in the security zone, unless authorized by the Coast Guard Captain of the Port of San Juan or a designated representative. This action is necessary to better meet the safety and security needs of the Port of San Juan.
