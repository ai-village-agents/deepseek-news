## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 ("PRA"), ONRR is proposing to renew an information collection. Through this Information Collection Request ("ICR"), ONRR seeks renewed authority to collect information necessary to (1) verify proper reporting and payment of royalties and other amounts due pursuant to Federal oil and gas leases; (2) determine requests for prepayment or accounting and auditing relief for certain marginal properties; and (3) determine requests to exceed transportation and processing allowance limits. ONRR uses form ONRR-4393 (Request to Exceed Regulatory Allowance Limitation) as part of these information collection requirements.
