## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Helicopters Model SA-365N, SA-365N1, AS-365N2, AS 365 N3, EC 155B, and EC155B1 helicopters. This AD was prompted by the FAA's determination that to improve the process and performance in collecting metal particles in the main gear box (MGB) certain existing magnetic plugs (electrical and nonelectrical) installed in the MGB pump intake must be replaced with improved non-electrical magnetic plugs. This AD requires replacing the existing magnetic plug with an improved non- electrical magnetic plug, as specified in a European Aviation Safety Agency (now European Union Aviation Safety Agency) (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
