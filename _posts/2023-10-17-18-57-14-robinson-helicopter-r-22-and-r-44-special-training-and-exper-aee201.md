## Summary

This rulemaking would revise the Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR), Robinson R-22/44 Special Training and Experience Requirements, to provide consistency with other FAA regulatory requirements, training, and testing publications. The rulemaking would remove the low gravity (low G) dual flight instruction requirement to align the SFAR with current aircraft placard requirements and the limitations section of the Rotorcraft Flight Manual/Pilot Operating Handbook (RFM/POH) set forth by Airworthiness Directives (ADs). This proposed revision would also update the SFAR so it mirrors the terminology currently used in the Helicopter Flying Handbook and Practical Test Standards (PTS). This rulemaking proposes to clarify the awareness training endorsement and flight review requirements for less experienced pilots, remove legacy dates, and update the applicability section to include ground and flight training, including flight reviews provided by authorized flight instructors. Additionally, the FAA proposes to add an expiration date to the SFAR to allow the FAA time to review and refine the R-22 and R-44 requirements for ground training, aeronautical experience, including flight training, and flight reviews, before moving them to a permanent location in a separate subchapter.
