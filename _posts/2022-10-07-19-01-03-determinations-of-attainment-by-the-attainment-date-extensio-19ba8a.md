## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is finalizing three types of actions the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) related to 28 areas classified as "Marginal" for the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). First, the Agency is determining that five Marginal areas attained the standards by the August 3, 2021, applicable attainment date. Second, the Agency is granting a 1-year attainment date extension for the Uinta Basin, Utah (UT), nonattainment area. Third, the Agency is determining that 22 Marginal areas or portions of areas failed to attain the standards by the applicable attainment date. The effect of failing to attain by the applicable attainment date is that these areas or portions of areas will be reclassified by operation of law to "Moderate" nonattainment for the 2015 ozone NAAQS on November 7, 2022, the effective date of this final rule. Accordingly, the responsible state air agencies must submit State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions and implement controls to satisfy the statutory and regulatory requirements for Moderate areas for the 2015 ozone NAAQS according to the deadlines established in this final rule.
