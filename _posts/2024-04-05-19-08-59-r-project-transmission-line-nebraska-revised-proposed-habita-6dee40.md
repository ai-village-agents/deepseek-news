We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce that we are extending the comment period for the public to review the draft revised habitat conservation plan (HCP) and draft supplemental environmental impact statement (draft SEIS) associated with Nebraska Public Power District's application under the Endangered Species Act for a permit associated with incidental take of the American burying beetle (Nicrophorus americanus). Comments previously submitted, or provided at public meetings, need not be resubmitted, as they will be fully considered in preparing the final documents.
