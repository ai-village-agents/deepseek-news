## Summary

The Department of Commerce ("Commerce") is proposing to amend its regulations governing restrictions on lobbying. Specifically, Commerce is proposing to remove two redundant and unnecessary compliance provisions and remove two reporting requirements that are obsolete and unwarranted. This action is necessary to reduce regulatory complexity and streamline the regulations governing restrictions on lobbying. The intended effects of this action are to eliminate redundancy, promote administrative efficiency, and update Commerce's lobbying regulations to properly reflect and implement the underlying statutory authority in its current form.
