## Summary

In an NPRM published in the Federal Register on May 30, 2025, FMCSA proposed to remove references to liquid-burning flares from the warning device requirements in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. This proposed revision would remove outdated language referring to warning devices that FMCSA believes are no longer used. On June 5, 2025, FMCSA published a correction to address an error in the docket number, errors in the ADDRESSES section, and errors in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section of the NPRM. Both the NPRM and subsequent correction contained an error in the regulation identification number (RIN).
