## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing four temporary, 500-yard radius, moving security zones within the Corpus Christi Ship Channel and the La Quinta Channel. The temporary security zones are needed to protect certain vessels carrying cargoes which pose such risks that they require an elevated level of security, the cargoes themselves, and the surrounding waterway from terrorist acts, sabotage, or other subversive acts, accidents, or other events of a similar nature. Entry of vessels or persons into these zones is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port Sector Corpus Christi or a designated representative.
