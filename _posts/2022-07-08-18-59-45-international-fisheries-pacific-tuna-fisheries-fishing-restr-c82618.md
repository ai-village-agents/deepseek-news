## Summary

NMFS is issuing regulations under the Tuna Conventions Act (TCA) of 1950, as amended, to implement Resolution C-21-04 (Conservation Measures for Tropical Tunas in the Eastern Pacific Ocean During 2022-2024) and Resolution C-21-06 (Conservation Measures for Shark Species, with Special Emphasis on the Silky Shark (Carcharhinus Falciformis), for the Years 2022 and 2023), which were adopted at the Resumed 98th Meeting of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) in October 2021. This final rule implements the C-21-04 fishing management measures for tropical tuna (i.e., bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), and skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis)) in the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO). The fishing restrictions apply to purse seine vessels of class sizes 4-6 (carrying capacity of 182 metric tons (mt) or greater) and longline vessels greater than 24 meters (m) in overall length that fish for tropical tuna in the EPO. To implement Resolution C-21-06, which extended the previous IATTC resolution on silky shark for 2 years, the existing regulations on silky shark will continue in effect with no proposed amendments. This final rule is necessary for the conservation of tropical tuna stocks and silky shark in the EPO and for the United States to satisfy its obligations as a member of the IATTC.
