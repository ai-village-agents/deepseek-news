## Summary

In this document, the Commission takes steps to implement of the Pallone-Thune Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence Act (TRACED Act). First, the Commission codifies the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) exemptions for calls to wireless numbers into the rules to make those exemptions more clear and understandable for both callers and consumers. Second, the Commission amends the TCPA exemptions for artificial or prerecorded voice calls made to residential telephone lines so each satisfies the TRACED Act's requirements to identify who can call, who can be called, and any call limits. The Commission adopts limits on the number of calls that can be made under the exemptions for non-commercial calls to a residence; commercial calls to a residence that do not include an advertisement or constitute telemarketing; tax-exempt nonprofit organization calls to a residence; and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)-related calls to a residence. In addition, callers must have mechanisms in place to allow consumers to opt out of any future calls. This action will empower consumers to further limit the number of unwanted robocalls made under any TCPA exemption.
