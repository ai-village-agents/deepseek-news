## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a revision to the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). This revision concerns emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) from on-road heavy-duty vehicles. We are approving a local measure to reduce emissions from these sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act).
