## Summary

This proposed rule would suspend the Federal marketing order regulating dried prunes produced in California (Order) effective at the beginning of the 2023-2024 crop year. After operating for 18 years without handling regulations, the Prune Administrative Committee (Committee) recommended the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) indefinitely suspend the Order. After reviewing the Committee's recommendation, AMS determined that regulatory suspension with a sunset provision of seven years is appropriate. This suspension period would extend through the end of the 2029-2030 crop year and would provide industry sufficient time to assess whether the Order's reinstatement is beneficial. If no recommendation is made by the Committee to reinstate the Order by the end of the 2029-2030 crop year, AMS would proceed to terminate the Order.
