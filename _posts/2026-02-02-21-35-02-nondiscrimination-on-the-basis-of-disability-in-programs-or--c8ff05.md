## Summary

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS or Department) published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the Federal Register on December 19, 2025. As a result of administrative technical issues, HHS is re-opening the public comment period for the public to submit comments. The purpose of the NPRM is to limit ambiguity by clarifying that the statutory exclusion of "gender identity disorders not resulting from physical impairments" from the scope of what constitutes discrimination includes "gender dysphoria not resulting from a physical impairment."
