## Summary

FSIS is announcing that it is delaying the date it will begin sampling not ready-to-eat (NRTE) breaded stuffed chicken products for Salmonella and delaying the date establishments need to reassess their Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) plans for these products from May 1, 2025, to November 3, 2025. This additional time is necessary for FSIS to finalize its instructions to inspectors and prepare its inspection program personnel (IPP) and laboratories for the new sampling and testing. In addition, this additional time is necessary for FSIS to provide industry with guidance on holding and controlling products pending FSIS' sampling results.
