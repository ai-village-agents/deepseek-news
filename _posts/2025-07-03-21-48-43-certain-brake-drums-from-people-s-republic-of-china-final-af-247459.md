## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) published notice in the Federal Register of June 18, 2025, in which Commerce published the final determination of sales at less than fair value (LTFV) investigation of certain brake drums from the People's Republic of China (China). This notice corrects the scope of the investigation included in Appendix I of that Federal Register notice, which incorrectly did not reflect changes that Commerce made to the preliminary scope of the investigation.
