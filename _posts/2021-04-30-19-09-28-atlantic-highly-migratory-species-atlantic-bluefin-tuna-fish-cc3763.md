## Summary

NMFS has determined that the Atlantic bluefin tuna (BFT) daily retention limit that applies to Highly Migratory Species (HMS) Angling category permitted vessels and HMS Charter/Headboat vessels (when fishing recreationally for BFT) should be adjusted for the remainder of 2021, based on consideration of the regulatory determination criteria regarding inseason adjustments. NMFS is adjusting the Angling category BFT daily retention limit from the default of one school, large school, or small medium BFT to: Two school BFT and one large school/small medium BFT per vessel per day/trip for private vessels with HMS Angling category permits; three school BFT and one large school/small medium BFT per vessel per day/trip for charter boat vessels with HMS Charter/ Headboat permits when fishing recreationally; and six school BFT and two large school/small medium BFT per vessel per day/trip for headboat vessels with HMS Charter/Headboat permits when fishing recreationally. These retention limits are effective in all areas, except for the Gulf of Mexico, where targeted fishing for BFT is prohibited.
