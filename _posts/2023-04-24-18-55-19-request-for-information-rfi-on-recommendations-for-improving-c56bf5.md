## Summary

The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit public input on proposed changes to the peer review of Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) fellowship applications that would restructure the review criteria and modify some sections of the Public Health Service (PHS) Fellowship Supplemental Form within the application. The goal of this effort is to facilitate the mission of NRSA fellowship peer review: to identify the most promising trainees and the excellent, individualized training programs that will help them become the outstanding scientists of the next generation. The proposed changes will allow peer reviewers to better evaluate the applicant's potential and the quality of the scientific training plan without undue influence of the sponsor's or institution's reputation; and ensure that the information provided in the application is aligned with the restructured criteria and targeted to the fellowship candidate's specific training needs.
