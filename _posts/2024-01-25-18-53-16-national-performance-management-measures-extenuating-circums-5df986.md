# National Performance Management Measures; Extenuating Circumstances, Highway Performance Monitoring System Data Field Names, Safety Performance Measure, Pavement Condition Measure, and Freight Performance Measure

## Summary

This rulemaking proposes updates to the National Performance Management Measures regulations to consider impacts of national emergencies on performance achievement, address compliance determinations and penalty assessment for the pavement condition measures, clarify data collection standards and requirements, adjust freight reporting to align with the 4-year update cycle for State Freight Plans in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), and provide select clarifying technical corrections. The rulemaking would also incorporate by reference the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) Field Manual, which includes updated fields related to the collection of Transportation Performance Management (TPM) data. This rulemaking also would provide for greater opportunities for meaningful safety performance targets and outcomes, consider approaches to alternative safety performance measures, and align performance targets for the three common measures that must be identical with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
