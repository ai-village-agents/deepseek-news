## Summary

MARAD invites public comments on its intention to request Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The proposed collection OMB 2133-0550 titled MARAD Exercise Breakout Survey is being renamed "MARAD Mariner Preparedness Exercise Survey (Mariner PrepEx Survey)" to reflect the new name of the exercise program, which includes this survey. Since the last renewal, survey questions 1 and 2 are being updated to include additional modes of communication that may be restricted, while mariners are actively supporting Department of Defense Missions aboard MARAD ships. There was also an increase in the totals for respondents, responses, and burden hours. MARAD is required to publish this notice in the Federal Register to obtain comments from the public and affected agencies.
