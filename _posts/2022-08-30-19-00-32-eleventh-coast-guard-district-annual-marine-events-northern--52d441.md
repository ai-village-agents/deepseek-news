## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to update the list of marine events occurring annually within the Eleventh Coast Guard District, specifically within the San Francisco Captain of the Port (COTP) zone. This rule would enable vessel movement restrictions in the regulated area when the special local regulations are activated and enforced. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
