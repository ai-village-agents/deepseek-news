## Summary

DHS is issuing a final rule to amend the Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) to modify a subpart, remove an existing clause and reserve the clause number, update an existing clause, and add two new contract clauses to address requirements for the safeguarding of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). This final rule implements security and privacy measures to safeguard CUI and facilitate improved incident reporting to DHS. These measures are necessary because of the urgent need to protect CUI and respond appropriately when DHS contractors experience incidents with DHS information.
