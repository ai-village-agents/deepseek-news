## Summary

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) seeks comment on regulations implementing amendments to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) that assist consumers who are victims of trafficking. The proposed rule, which would implement a recent amendment to the FCRA, would establish a method for a victim of trafficking to submit documentation to consumer reporting agencies, including information identifying any adverse item of information about the consumer that resulted from certain types of human trafficking, and prohibit the consumer reporting agencies from furnishing a consumer report containing the adverse item(s) of information. The Bureau is taking this action as mandated by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 and to assist consumers who are victims of trafficking in building or rebuilding financial stability and personal independence.
