## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a reinstatement of a currently approved data collection titled "Formative Research to Develop HIV Social Marketing Campaigns for Healthcare Providers." The purpose of this data collection is to understand healthcare providers' interpretation and understanding of existing and emergent HIV prevention science; understand how providers use guidance or evidence-based approaches in their practices generally and with populations that have been largely overlooked (e.g., transgender individuals, people who inject drugs (PWID)); and to inform the development and/or revision of messages, concepts and materials for healthcare providers designed to support patient-provider communication about HIV testing, prevention, and care in support of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Ending the HIV Epidemic.
