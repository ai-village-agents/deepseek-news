## Summary

On November 29, 2023, the Department of Commerce (DOC) published in the Federal Register a notice entitled "Request for Information (RFI) on Business Diversity Principles." This RFI invited comments from the public on the draft Business Diversity Principles (BDP), which describe best practices related to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) in the private sector, and on the impact of DEIA initiatives. DOC is seeking input to inform the content of the BDP, share success stories and best practices related to Business Diversity, and comment on the impact of DEIA initiatives. In response from prospective commenters that they would benefit from additional time to adequately consider and respond to the RFI, DOC has determined that an extension of the comment period until February 2, 2024, is appropriate.
