## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and A350-1041 airplanes. This AD is prompted by reports that excessively deep spot faces on the front engine mounting bolt holes on the wing pylon were detected on the production line. This AD requires a one-time inspection for clash (interference) of the three front engine mounting bolt holes on both the left and right wing pylons, and, depending on findings, accomplishment of applicable corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
