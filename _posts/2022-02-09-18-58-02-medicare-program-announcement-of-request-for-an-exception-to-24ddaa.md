## Summary

The Social Security Act prohibits a physician-owned hospital from expanding its facility capacity unless the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services grants the hospital's request for an exception to that prohibition after considering input on the request from individuals and entities in the community where the hospital is located. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has received a request from a physician-owned hospital for an exception to the prohibition on expansion of facility capacity. This notice solicits comments on the request from individuals and entities in the community in which the hospital is located. Community input may inform our determination regarding whether the requesting hospital qualifies for an exception to the prohibition on expansion of facility capacity.
