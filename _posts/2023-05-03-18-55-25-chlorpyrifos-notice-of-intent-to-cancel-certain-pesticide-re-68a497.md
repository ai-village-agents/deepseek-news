## Summary

In accordance with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), EPA is issuing a notice of receipt of requests by registrants to voluntarily cancel their registrations of certain products containing the pesticide chlorpyrifos, or to amend their chlorpyrifos registrations to terminate one or more uses. EPA intends to grant these requests at the close of the comment period for this announcement, unless the Agency receives substantive comments within the comment period that would merit its further review, or the registrant withdraws their request. If these requests are granted, any sale, distribution, or use of products listed in this notice will be permitted after the registrations have been cancelled or the uses terminated only if such sale, distribution, or use is consistent with the terms as described in the final order.
