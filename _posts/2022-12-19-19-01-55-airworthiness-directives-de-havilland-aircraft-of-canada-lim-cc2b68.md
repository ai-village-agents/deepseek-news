## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited Model DHC-8-402 airplanes. This AD was prompted by an investigation that found that the actual operating temperatures within the integrated flight cabinet (IFC) were significantly higher than anticipated during certification. This AD requires a modification to improve the IFC cooling capacity. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
