## Summary

This notice announces that the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) is amending the DHS STEM Designated Degree Program List by adding 22 qualifying fields of study and a corresponding Department of Education Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code for each. The list is used to determine whether a degree obtained by certain F-1 nonimmigrant students following the completion of a program of study qualifies as a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) degree as determined by DHS, for the F-1 student to be eligible to apply for a 24-month extension of their post-completion optional practical training (OPT).
