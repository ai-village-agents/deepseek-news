## Summary

In response to a request from a domestic interested party, M&B Metal Products Co., Inc. (the requester), the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is initiating country-wide circumvention inquiries to determine whether imports of steel wire garment hangers (hangers) completed in Cambodia using components manufactured in the People's Republic of China (China) or the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (Vietnam) are circumventing the antidumping duty (AD) order on hangers from China, or the AD and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on hangers from Vietnam.
