## Summary

Oregon applied to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for final authorization of changes to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended. EPA has reviewed Oregon's application and has determined that these changes satisfy all requirements needed to qualify for authorization. EPA sought public comment under Docket #EPA-R10-RCRA- 2021-0439 from October 5, 2021, to November 4, 2021, prior to taking this final action to authorize these changes. EPA received five comments, only one of which was adverse. EPA's response to the comment and rationale for this final action are provided below.
