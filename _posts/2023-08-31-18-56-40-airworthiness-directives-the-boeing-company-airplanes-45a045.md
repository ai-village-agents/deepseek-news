## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-18- 11, which applied to all The Boeing Company Model 777 airplanes. AD 2022-18-11 required repetitive inspections for cracking of the left- and right-side ring chords, repair angles, front spar lower chords, and front spar webs (depending on configuration) common to a certain underwing longeron; modification of the front spar lower chord for some airplanes; repetitive post-modification inspections; and applicable on- condition actions. This AD was prompted by a report of a crack found in a front spar lower chord, and the determination that errors in the service information mandated by AD 2022-18-11 introduced a new unsafe condition related to the application of certain fastener cap seals. This AD retains the actions required by AD 2022-18-11, and requires a maintenance records review of previously modified airplanes for the procedures used during that modification, and applicable corrective actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
