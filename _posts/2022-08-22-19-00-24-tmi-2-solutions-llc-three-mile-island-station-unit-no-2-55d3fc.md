## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering issuance of an amendment to Possession Only License (POL) No. DPR-73, issued to TMI-2 Solutions, LLC (TMI-2 Solutions) for Three Mile Island Station, Unit No. 2 (TMI-2). Pursuant to NRC regulations, TMI-2 Solutions proposes an amendment to the POL for TMI-2. This proposed license amendment request (LAR), upon approval, would revise the POL and the associated Technical Specifications (TS) to support the transition of TMI-2 from Post Defueled Monitoring Storage (PDMS) to that of a facility undergoing decommissioning. The proposed amendment would revise the POL and TS to support Phase 1b and Phase 2 decommissioning activities associated with achieving the removal of all debris material,\1\ its transfer to dry cask storage at an Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation or to a suitable waste storage area, and the relocation of various requirements and the sealed sources TS to the TMI-2 Decommissioning Quality Assurance Plan (DQAP). For this amendment request, the NRC proposes to determine that it involves no significant hazards consideration (NSHC). Because the amendment request contains sensitive unclassified non-safeguards information (SUNSI), an order imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI for contention preparation by persons who file a hearing request or petition for leave to intervene. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
