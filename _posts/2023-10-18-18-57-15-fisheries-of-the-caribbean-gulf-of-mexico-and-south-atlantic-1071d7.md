## Summary

The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council) has submitted Amendment 56 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) for review, approval, and implementation by NMFS. If approved by the Secretary of Commerce, Amendment 56 would revise stock status determination criteria for Gulf gag, establish a rebuilding plan, and revise catch limits. Amendment 56 would also revise the sector allocations of the annual catch limit, revise recreational accountability measures (AMs), and revise the recreational fishing season. The purpose of this action is to implement a rebuilding plan for gag and to implement revised management measures to end overfishing and rebuild the stock.
