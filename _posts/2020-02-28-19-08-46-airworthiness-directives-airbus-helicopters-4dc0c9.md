## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Airbus Helicopters Model EC 155B and EC155B1 helicopters. This proposed AD would require modifying the wiring of the attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) connector. This proposed AD is prompted by a report of wiring of the AHRS contrary to approved design specifications. The actions of this proposed AD are intended to address an unsafe condition on these products.
