## Summary

This action proposes to amend Class D airspace by updating the geographic coordinates, and remove Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Bogue Field Marine Corps Auxiliary Landing Field, (MCALF), Bogue, NC, at the request of the US Marine Corps. Class E airspace is no longer required, as there are no instrument approaches into Bogue Field MCALF. This action would also replace the outdated term Airport/Facility Directory with term Chart Supplement in the legal description of associated Class D airspace. This action would enhance the safety and management of controlled airspace within the National Airspace System.
