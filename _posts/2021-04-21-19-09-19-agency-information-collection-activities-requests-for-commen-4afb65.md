## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on January 29, 2021. The collection involves the gathering of information necessary for FAA to ensure proposed outdoor laser operations will not interfere with air traffic operations. The information to be collected will be used by FAA to evaluate proposed outdoor laser operations (e.g., laser light show, display, or device) requiring approval of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) variance.
