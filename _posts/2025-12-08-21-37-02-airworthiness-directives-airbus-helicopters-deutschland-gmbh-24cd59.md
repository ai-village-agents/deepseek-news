## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH Model MBB-BK 117 C-2 and MBB-BK 117 D-2 helicopters. This AD was prompted by reports of significant wear of the spherical bearings of the control rod assembly and pitch link assembly. This AD requires measuring the radial play of certain spherical bearings of control rod assemblies and pitch link assemblies, reporting the results, and depending on the results, taking corrective action. This AD also prohibits installing certain control rod assemblies and pitch link assemblies unless certain requirements are met. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
