## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission or FCC) seeks comment on the need for updates to its rules implementing the Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (CALM) Act. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) seeks to develop a record to help the Commission and the public better understand consumer complaints about loud commercials. The NPRM seeks input from consumers and industry on the extent to which the CALM Act rules have been effective in controlling and preventing loud commercials on programming provided by television broadcasters and pay TV providers. The Commission also asks about its authority to address loud commercials and the consistency of program volume on streaming platforms. Finally, the NPRM asks what actions the Commission, industry, or standards developers could take in this area to further minimize consumer harm.
