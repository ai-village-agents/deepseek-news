## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Commonwealth of Virginia. The revision consists of amendments to a federally enforceable state operating permit (FESOP) which was previously incorporated into the Virginia SIP in order to implement reasonably available control technology (RACT) for nitrogen oxide (NO<INF>X</INF>) emissions from Steel Dynamics, Inc. (hereafter "SDI," formerly Roanoke Electric Steel). This action is being taken under the Clean Air Act (CAA).
