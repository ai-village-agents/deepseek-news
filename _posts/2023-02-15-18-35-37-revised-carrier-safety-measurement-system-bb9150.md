## Summary

Since 2010, FMCSA has used its Safety Measurement System (SMS) to identify motor carriers for safety interventions. The National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) recommended on June 27, 2017, that FMCSA develop and test a new statistical model. This notice explains FMCSA's analysis and the Agency's proposed changes to SMS, announces FMCSA's preview of the proposed changes, and requests comments and input on the Agency's system to identify motor carriers for safety interventions.
