## Summary

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, invites the general public to take this opportunity to comment on an extension, without change, of a currently approved information collection. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice seeks comments concerning this instrument, which is used by Federally- regulated lending institutions when making, increasing, extending, renewing or purchasing each loan for the purpose of determining whether flood insurance is required and available.
