## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class D and Class E airspace at Lake Charles, LA. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of airspace reviews conducted as part of the decommissioning of the Beaumont very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program. This action would also update the geographic coordinates of various airports. This action will bring the airspace into compliance with FAA orders to support instrument flight rule (IFR) operations.
