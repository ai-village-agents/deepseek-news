## Summary

NMFS proposes to implement allowable catch levels, an overfishing limit, an allowable biological catch, and an annual catch limit for Pacific mackerel in the exclusive economic zone off the U.S. West Coast (California, Oregon, and Washington) for the fishing years (seasons) 2023-2024 and 2024-2025. This proposed rule is made pursuant to the Coastal Pelagic Species Fishery Management Plan. The proposed harvest guideline and annual catch target for the 2023-2024 fishing season are 7,871 metric tons (mt) and 6,871 mt, respectively. The proposed harvest guideline and annual catch target for the 2024-2025 fishing season are 8,943 mt and 7,943 mt, respectively. If the fishery attains the annual catch target in either fishing season, the directed fishery will close, reserving the 1,000-mt difference between the harvest guideline and annual catch target as a set-aside for incidental landings in other Coastal Pelagic Species fisheries and other sources of mortality. This rulemaking is intended to conserve and manage the Pacific mackerel stock off the U.S. West Coast.
