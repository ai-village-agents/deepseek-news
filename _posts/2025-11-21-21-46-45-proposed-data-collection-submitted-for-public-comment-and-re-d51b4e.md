## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). PRAMS is a project of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and health departments that collects jurisdiction-specific, population- based data on maternal attitudes and experiences before, during, and shortly after pregnancy.
