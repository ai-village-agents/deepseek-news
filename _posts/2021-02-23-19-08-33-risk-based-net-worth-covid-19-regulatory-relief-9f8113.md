## Summary

The NCUA Board (Board) is issuing this proposal to raise the asset threshold for defining a credit union as "complex" for purposes of being subject to any risk-based net worth requirement in the NCUA's regulations. The proposed rule would amend the NCUA's regulations to provide that any risk-based net worth requirement will be applicable only to a federally insured natural-person credit union (credit union) with quarter-end assets that exceed $500 million and a risk-based net worth requirement that exceeds six percent. The COVID-19 pandemic has created a vital need for financial institutions, including credit unions, to provide access to responsible credit and other member services to support consumers. Implementing this regulatory change in advance of January 1, 2022, the effective date of the 2015 final risk based capital (RBC) rule issued by the NCUA, would provide necessary capital relief to a significant number of credit unions without substantially decreasing the safety and soundness of credit unions or the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF).
