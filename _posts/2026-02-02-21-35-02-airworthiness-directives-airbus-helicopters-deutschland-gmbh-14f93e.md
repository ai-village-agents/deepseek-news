## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2014-13- 09, which applied to certain Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (AHD) helicopters Model EC135P1, EC135P2, EC135P2+, EC135T1, EC135T2, and EC135T2+ helicopters. AD 2014-13-09 required repetitive visual inspections of the ring frame X9227 for a crack, and if there is a crack, replacing the ring frame. Since the FAA issued AD 2014-13-09, AHD Helicopters determined that this unsafe condition also applies to AHD Model EC135P3 and EC135T3 helicopters. This AD continues to require some of the actions required by AD 2014-13-09 and expands the applicability by including AHD Model EC135P3 and EC135T3 helicopters and also reduces the compliance time for the repetitive inspections. This AD also allows the modification of the ring frame X9227 as terminating action for the repetitive visual inspections. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
