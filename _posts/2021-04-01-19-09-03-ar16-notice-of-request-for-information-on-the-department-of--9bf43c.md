The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is requesting information to assist in implementing the requirements of section 201 of the Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act of 2019. The Act mandates VA to establish the Staff Sergeant Parker Gordon Fox Suicide Prevention Grant Program (SSG Fox SPGP) to reduce veteran suicide through a three-year community-based grant program that would provide financial assistance to eligible entities to provide or coordinate providing suicide prevention services to eligible veterans and their families. VA is required to consult with certain entities related to administering this new grant program, and through this request for information, VA seeks comments on various topics to help inform VA's development of the SSG Fox SPGP and its implementing regulations.
