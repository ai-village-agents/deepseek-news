## Summary

Through this temporary rule, NMFS implements accountability measures (AMs) for the red snapper recreational sector private angling component in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) off Texas for the 2021 fishing year. Based on information provided by the State of Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD), NMFS has determined that the 2020 Texas regional management area private angling component annual catch limit (ACL) for Gulf red snapper was exceeded. Therefore, NMFS reduces the 2021 private angling component ACL of Gulf red snapper for the Texas regional management area. This reduction will remain in effect through the remainder of the current fishing year on December 31, 2021, and is necessary to protect the Gulf red snapper resource.
