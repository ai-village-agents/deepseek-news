## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FMCSA announces its plan to submit the Information Collection Request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review and approval and invites public comment. FMCSA requests OMB's renewed approval to the ICR titled "Practices of Household Brokers," which applies to household goods (HHG) brokers who are procured by the public (HHG shippers) to arrange the transportation of the shipper's household goods by HHG motor carriers. This renewal updates wage related costs that have changed since the last approval and revises the previous information collection total respondent hourly and cost burden.
