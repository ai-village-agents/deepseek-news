## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled "Advanced Manufacturing Technologies Designation Program." FDA encourages the early adoption of advanced manufacturing technologies (AMTs) by the pharmaceutical industry, which can improve the reliability and robustness of the manufacturing process and can benefit patients by enhancing product quality and reducing drug development time or increasing or maintaining the supply of drugs that are life-supporting, life-sustaining, of critical importance to providing health care, or in shortage. This guidance provides recommendations to persons and organizations interested in participating in FDA's Advanced Manufacturing Technologies Designation Program, which facilitates the development of drugs manufactured using an AMT that has been designated as such under the program. The guidance finalizes the draft guidance of the same title issued on December 13, 2023.
