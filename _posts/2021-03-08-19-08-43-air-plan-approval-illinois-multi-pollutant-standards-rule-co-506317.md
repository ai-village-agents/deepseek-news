## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the Illinois State Implementation Plan (SIP) to amend requirements applicable to certain coal-fired electric generating units (EGUs) in the Illinois Administrative Code (IAC), also known as the Multi-Pollutant Standards Rule. On January 23, 2020, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) submitted a request to amend the provisions of the Multi-Pollutant Standards Rule in the Illinois regional haze SIP. EPA is proposing to approve the revision because it will result in a significant decrease in emissions of NO<INF>X</INF> and SO<INF>2,</INF> meets the applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA), and does not interfere with any applicable requirement concerning attainment and reasonable further progress.
