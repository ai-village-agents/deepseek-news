## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model H160-B helicopters. This AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD requires revising the existing maintenance manual or instructions for continued airworthiness and the existing approved maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, by incorporating new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
