## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its small business size standards, which are used to qualify an NRC licensee as a "small entity" under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended. The purpose of these size standards is for reducing annual NRC license fees for small entities. These standards do not apply to the NRC's contracts for goods and services. The NRC is increasing the upper and lower tiers for its receipts-based small entity size standards for small businesses and small not-for-profit organizations. This change allows NRC standards to remain consistent with the inflation adjustments made by the Small Business Administration size standard for nonmanufacturing concerns. In addition, in accordance with the Small Business Runway Extension Act of 2018, the NRC is changing the calculation of annual average receipts for the receipts-based NRC size standard for small businesses that provide a service or small businesses not engaged in manufacturing from a 3-year averaging period to a 5-year averaging period.
