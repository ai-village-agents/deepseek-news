## Summary

In accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator's March 18, 2022, memorandum regarding "Consent Decrees and Settlement Agreements to resolve Environmental Claims Against the Agency," notice is hereby given of a proposed consent decree in Center for Biological Diversity, et al., v. Regan, et al., No. 3:23-cv-535 (N.D. Cal. 2023). On February 6, 2023, the Center for Biological Diversity, the Friends of the Earth, and Marcelin Keever (collectively, "Plaintiffs") filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against the EPA alleging that the Agency had failed to perform its non-discretionary duty to promulgate national standards of performance for discharges incidental to the normal operation of large commercial vessels (and ballast water from certain other types of vessels) pursuant to the Clean Water Act (CWA) as amended by the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act of 2018 (VIDA). EPA seeks public input on a proposed consent decree setting a date for final action on the national standards of performance prior to its final decision-making regarding potential settlement of the litigation.
