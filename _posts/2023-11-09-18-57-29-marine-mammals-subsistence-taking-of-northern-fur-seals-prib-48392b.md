## Summary

NMFS announces the receipt of a petition for rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The Aleut Community of St. Paul Island (ACSPI), the Traditional Council of St. George Island (TCSGI), and the Aleut Marine Mammal Commission (AMMC) have petitioned NMFS to revise regulations governing the subsistence taking of northern fur seals. The revisions requested include: changing the current hunting season on St. Paul Island, Alaska to begin on October 15, creating an annual hunting season on St. George Island, Alaska to begin on October 15 and end on May 31, and creating an annual hunting season in the Aleutian Islands in Alaska to begin on November 1 and end on April 30, with an upper take limit for the Aleutian Islands of 100 non-breeding male fur seals. NMFS solicits public comments on this request. NMFS will consider all comments and available information when determining whether to proceed with rulemaking.
