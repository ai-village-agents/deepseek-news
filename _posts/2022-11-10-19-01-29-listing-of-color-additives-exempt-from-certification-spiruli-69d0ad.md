## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is amending the color additive regulations to provide for the expanded safe use of spirulina (Arthrospira platensis) extract as a color additive in alcoholic beverages with less than 20 percent alcohol-by-volume content, non-alcoholic beverages, condiments and sauces, dips, dairy product alternatives (identified as non-dairy yogurt alternatives, non-dairy frozen desserts, and non-dairy puddings), salad dressings, and seasoning mixes (unheated). This action is in response to a color additive petition (CAP) filed by GNT USA, Inc. (GNT).
