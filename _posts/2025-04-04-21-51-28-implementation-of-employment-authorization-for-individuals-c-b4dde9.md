## Summary

On January 15, 2025, former President Joseph Biden issued a memorandum to the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) determining it was in the foreign policy interest of the United States to expand and extend the deferral of removal of certain Hong Kong residents present in the United States through February 5, 2027, and to provide them with employment authorization documentation. This notice provides information about Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) for eligible Hong Kong residents and how eligible individuals may apply for DED-based Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) with USCIS, as well as for travel authorization.
