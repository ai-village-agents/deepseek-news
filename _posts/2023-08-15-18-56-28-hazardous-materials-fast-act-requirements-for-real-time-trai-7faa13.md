## Summary

On June 27, 2023, PHMSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking, titled "Hazardous Materials: FAST Act Requirements for Real-Time Train Consist Information (HM-263)," proposing amendments to the Hazardous Materials Regulations to require all railroads to generate in electronic form, maintain, and provide to first responders, emergency response officials, and law enforcement personnel, certain information regarding hazardous materials in rail transportation to enhance emergency response and investigative efforts. In response to a request for an extension of the comment period submitted by the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association (ASLRRA), PHMSA is extending the comment period for the HM-263 notice by an additional 60 days. Comments to the HM-263 notice will now be due by October 27, 2023.
