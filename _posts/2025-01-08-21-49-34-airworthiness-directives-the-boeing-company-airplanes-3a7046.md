## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 767-200, -300, and -300F airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of a main landing gear (MLG) collapse event following maintenance where a grinder was operating outside of its input parameters, resulting in possible heat damage to the outer cylinder of the MLG. This AD requires replacing affected outer cylinders. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
