## Summary

The U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) is issuing a proposed rule to revise the component designations of three agencies for purposes of the one-year post-employment conflict of interest restriction for senior employees. Specifically, based on the recommendations of the agencies concerned, OGE is proposing to designate two new components in appendix B to 5 CFR part 2641, and to correct an inadvertent error in the current appendix B listing of a previously-designated component.
