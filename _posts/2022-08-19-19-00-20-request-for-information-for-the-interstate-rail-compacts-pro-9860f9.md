## Summary

On November 5, 2021, President Biden signed into law the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). The BIL provides historic appropriations for the railroad transportation grant programs administered by FRA and authorizes new programs to enhance rail safety and to repair, restore, improve, and expand the nation's rail network. A new program established under the BIL is the Interstate Rail Compacts Grant Program (the Program), which provides financial assistance to existing interstate rail compacts (IRCs) to strengthen their capability to advance intercity passenger rail service within their regions. The BIL requires the Secretary of Transportation to establish the Program; this responsibility is delegated to FRA. In this RFI, FRA seeks comments on the Program.
