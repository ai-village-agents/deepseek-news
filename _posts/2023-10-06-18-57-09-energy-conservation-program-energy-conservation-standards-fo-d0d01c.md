## Summary

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended ("EPCA"), prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment, including Commercial Water Heating ("CWH") equipment. EPCA also requires the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") to periodically review standards. In this final rule, DOE is adopting amended energy conservation standards for CWH equipment.
