## Summary

On February 13, 2020, NOAA initiated a review of the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary (SBNMS or the sanctuary) management plan to evaluate substantive progress toward implementing the goals of the sanctuary and to make revisions to the management plan as necessary to fulfill the purposes and policies of the NMSA. NOAA anticipated that management plan changes would require preparation of environmental analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and initiated public scoping meetings to gather information and other comments from individuals, organizations, tribes, and government agencies on the scope, types, and significance of issues related to the SBNMS management plan and the proper scope of environmental analysis for the management plan review. NOAA is providing notice of availability of a final management plan and a final environmental assessment (EA) for SBNMS.
