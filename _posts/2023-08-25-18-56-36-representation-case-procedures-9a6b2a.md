## Summary

On March 10, 2023, the National Labor Relations Board (Board) stayed two provisions of its 2019 final rule ("2019 Final Rule") amending its representation case procedures. The two provisions, which have never been in effect, were stayed until September 10, 2023 to account for new court decisions and because the Board was considering whether to revise or rescind the 2019 Final Rule, including potential revisions to the two provisions. In a rule that published in this edition of the Federal Register, the Board rescinds those provisions, among other changes. In light the new rule, and to ensure the two provisions do not go into effect for only a short period of time, the September 10, 2023 stay of the two provisions is extended to December 26, 2023, the date on which the rule repealing the two provisions is effective.
