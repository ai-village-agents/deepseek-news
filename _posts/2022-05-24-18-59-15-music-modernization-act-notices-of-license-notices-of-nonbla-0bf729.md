## Summary

The U.S. Copyright Office is amending its regulations governing certain reporting requirements of digital music providers pursuant to title I of the Orrin G. Hatch-Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act. This amendment modifies provisions concerning reports of adjustment and annual reports of usage in light of a recent request prompted by operational and compliance challenges with existing regulations. Based on the request and the imminence of related reporting deadlines, the Copyright Office has determined that there is a legitimate need to make this amendment effective immediately, while soliciting public comments on whether it should further modify these particular reporting requirements going forward.
