## Summary

The NCUA Board (Board) is proposing to amend various parts of the NCUA's regulations to permit low-income designated credit unions (LICUs), Complex Credit Unions, and New Credit Unions to issue Subordinated Debt for purposes of regulatory capital treatment. Specifically, this proposed rule would create a new subpart in the NCUA's final risk-based capital rule (RBC Rule) that would address the requirements for and regulatory capital treatment of Subordinated Debt. This new subpart would, among other things, contain requirements related to applying for authority to issue Subordinated Debt, credit union eligibility to issue Subordinated Debt, prepayments, disclosures, securities laws, and the terms of a Subordinated Debt Note. This proposed rule also makes various additions and amendments to other parts and sections of the NCUA's regulations.
