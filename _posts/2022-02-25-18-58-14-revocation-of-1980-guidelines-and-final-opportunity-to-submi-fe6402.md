## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is revoking the 1980 guidelines and associated procedures for correcting the specific chemical identities of incorrectly described chemical substances submitted to EPA in 1978 using the original reporting form for inclusion on the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Chemical Substance Inventory (Inventory). In so doing, the Agency is providing a final opportunity to use the 1980 guidelines and form to request corrections of Inventory listings to address errors with the chemical identities submitted in the original reporting forms. The regulated community will have 60 days from the date of this notice to submit any final Inventory corrections. EPA is also announcing the discontinuation of the related form and associated approval of the collection activities under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA).
