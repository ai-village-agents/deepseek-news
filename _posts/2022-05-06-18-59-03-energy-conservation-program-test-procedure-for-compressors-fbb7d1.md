## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is initiating a review through this RFI to consider whether to amend DOE's test procedure for compressors. To inform interested parties and to facilitate this process, DOE has identified certain issues associated with the currently applicable test procedure on which DOE is interested in receiving comment. The issues outlined in this document mainly concern the scope of coverage, updated industry test procedures and the accuracy, representativeness and cost of existing test requirements. DOE welcomes written comments from the public on any subject within the scope of this document (including topics not raised in this RFI), as well as the submission of data and other relevant information.
