## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-2B19 (Regional Jet Series 100 & 440) airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of a wing stall (wing drop/ uncommanded roll) during landing flare, due to ice on the wing leading edges that was not detected by the anti-ice system. This AD requires revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to include a limitation and normal operating procedure for the wing anti-ice system. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
