## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary moving safety zone on the waters of the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Galveston, around a Tall Ships America Parade of Sail in Galveston, Texas. Once the vessels are moored at the Galveston Historic Seaport, a temporary fixed safety zone will be established. The safety zones are necessary to protect the public and wooden sailing vessels and their crews from the hazards associated with transiting the area. Persons and vessels are prohibited from entering, transiting through, anchoring in, or remaining within the moving and fixed safety zones unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Houston-Galveston or a designated representative.
