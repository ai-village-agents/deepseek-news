## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing an opportunity for public comment on the proposed collection of certain information by the Agency.

This notice solicits comments on the submission of reports of corrections and removals that are associated with medical and radiation emitting products regulated by FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
