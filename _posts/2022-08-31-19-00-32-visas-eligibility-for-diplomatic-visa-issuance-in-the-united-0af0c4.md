## Summary

This rule is promulgated to add categories of nonimmigrants who may be issued nonimmigrant visas in the United States. This amendment will add a limited category of nonimmigrants who are born in the United States, but not subject to the jurisdiction thereof, to noncitizens maintaining A-1, A-2, C-2, C-3, G-1, G-3, G-4, or NATO nonimmigrant status and properly classifiable as such. The goal of these revisions is to codify the longstanding policy allowing such children to be issued diplomatic visas domestically to document their entitlement to A, C, G, or NATO nonimmigrant status.
