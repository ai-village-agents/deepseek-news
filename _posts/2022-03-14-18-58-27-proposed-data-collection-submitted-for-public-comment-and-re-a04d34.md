## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on an information collection titled, Aggregate Reports for Tuberculosis Program Evaluation. The goal of the study is to allow CDC to collect and monitor indicators for key program activities, such as finding tuberculosis infections in recent contacts of cases and in other high- risk persons likely to be infected, and providing therapy for latent tuberculosis infection, in an effort to eliminate tuberculosis in the United States.
