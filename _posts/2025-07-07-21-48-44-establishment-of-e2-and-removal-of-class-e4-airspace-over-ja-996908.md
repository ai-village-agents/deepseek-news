## Summary

This action establishes Class E2 airspace extending upward from the surface above the New River Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS), Jacksonville, NC, as the air traffic control tower operates part-time. This action also removes the Class E4 airspace at New River MCAS (NCA), Jacksonville, NC, due to the current designated airspace no longer meeting the requirements of its designation. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.
