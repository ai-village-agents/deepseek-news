## Summary

On April 3, 2023, FRA published an NPRM proposing to amend its Passenger Equipment Safety Standards to modernize Tier I and Tier III safety appliance requirements; update the pre-revenue compliance documentation and testing requirements; establish crashworthiness requirements for individual Tier I-compliant vehicles equipped with crash energy management; establish standards for Tier III inspection, testing, and maintenance and movement of defective equipment; incorporate general safety requirements from FRA's Railroad Locomotive Safety Standards for Tier III trainsets; and provide for periodic inspection of emergency lighting to ensure proper functioning. By this notice, FRA is extending the NPRM's comment period, which will close on June 2, 2023, by 60 days.
