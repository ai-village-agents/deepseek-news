## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are reopening the comment period on our December 21, 2023, proposed rule to list the coal darter (Percina brevicauda), a benthic freshwater fish native to the Mobile River Basin in Alabama, as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). We are reopening the proposed rule's comment period for 30 days to give all interested parties an additional opportunity to comment on the proposed rule. Comments previously submitted will be fully considered in our final determination and do not need to be resubmitted.
