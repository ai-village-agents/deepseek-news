## Summary

This agenda announces the proposed regulatory actions that GSA plans for the next 12 months and those that were completed since the fall 2024 edition. This agenda was developed under the guidelines of Executive Orders 12866, "Regulatory Planning and Review," Executive Order 13563, Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review," Executive Order 14219, "Ensuring Lawful Governance and Implementing the President's `Department of Government Efficiency' Deregulatory Initiative," and Executive Order 14192, "Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation." GSA's purpose in publishing this agenda is to allow interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process. GSA also invites interested persons to recommend existing significant regulations for review to determine whether they should be modified or rescinded. The public may provide comments on rules via http://www.regulations.gov. The Unified Agenda, including previous versions, is available at www.reginfo.gov. Because publication in the Federal Register is mandated for the regulatory flexibility agendas required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 602), GSA's printed agenda entries include only: (1) Rules that are in the agency's regulatory flexibility agenda, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, because they are likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities; and (2) Any rules that the agency has identified for periodic review under section 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Printing of these entries is limited to fields that contain information required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act's agenda requirements. Additional information on these entries is available in the Unified Agenda. In addition, for fall editions of the agenda, the entire Regulatory Plan will continue to be printed in the Federal Register, as in past years, including GSA's regulatory plan.
