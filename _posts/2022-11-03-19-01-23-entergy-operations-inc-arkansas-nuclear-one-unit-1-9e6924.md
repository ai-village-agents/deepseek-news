## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering issuance of an amendment to Renewed Facility Operating License No. DPR- 51, issued to Entergy Operations, Inc., for operation of Arkansas Nuclear One, Unit 1 (ANO-1). The proposed amendment would revise the dose equivalent Iodine (I)-131 and the reactor coolant system (RCS) primary activity limits required by ANO-1 Technical Specification (TS) 3.4.12, "RCS Specific Activity," and the primary-to-secondary leak rate limit provided in TS 3.4.13, "RCS Operational LEAKAGE." For this amendment request, the NRC proposes to determine that it involves no significant hazards consideration. Because this amendment request contains sensitive unclassified non- safeguards information (SUNSI), an order imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI for contention preparation.
