## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede airworthiness directive (AD) 2021-13-07, which applies to all GE Aviation Czech s.r.o. (GEAC) (type certificate previously held by WALTER Engine a.s., Walter a.s., and MOTORLET a.s.) Model M601D-11, M601E-11, M601E-11A, M601E-11AS, M601E- 11S, and M601F engines. AD 2021-13-07 requires recalculating the life of critical parts and, depending on the results of the recalculation, replacing these critical parts. AD 2021-13-07 also requires replacing a certain compressor case. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-13-07, the manufacturer published the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the existing engine maintenance manual (EMM), which includes the calculations for the life of critical parts addressed by AD 2021-13-07 and prompted this proposed AD. This proposed AD would continue to require the replacement of a certain centrifugal compressor case. This proposed AD would also include an additional part number as an option for the replacement and would limit the applicability of the proposed AD, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
