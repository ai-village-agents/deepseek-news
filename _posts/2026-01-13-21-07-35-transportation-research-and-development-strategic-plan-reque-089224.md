## Summary

49 U.S.C. 6503 requires that the Secretary of Transportation develop a 5-year transportation research and development strategic plan to guide future Federal transportation research and development activities. The statute states that the strategic plan shall describe how the plan furthers the primary purpose of the transportation research and development program. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology (OST-R) invites the public and transportation system stakeholders to provide comments to inform the development of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT or Department) Research, Development, and Technology (RD&T) Strategic Plan for fiscal years (FY) 2026-2030. We welcome the views of the transportation research community on the Department's research vision, strategic goals, and priorities, and how our research programs can advance the transportation system of the present and future.
