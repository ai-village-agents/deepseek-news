## Summary

DoD, GSA, and NASA are withdrawing the proposed rule to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) titled: Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance. The decision not to proceed with a final rule has been made because the Presidential Memorandum regarding "The Mexico City Policy," dated January 23, 2017, has been revoked by the Memorandum on Protecting Women's Health at Home and Abroad issued by President Biden on January 28, 2021. Accordingly, this proposed rule is withdrawn, and the FAR case is closed.
