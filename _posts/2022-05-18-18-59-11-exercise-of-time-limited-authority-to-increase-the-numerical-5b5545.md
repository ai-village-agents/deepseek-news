## Summary

The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, is exercising his time-limited Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 authority and again increasing the total number of noncitizens who may receive an H-2B nonimmigrant visa by authorizing the issuance of no more than 35,000 additional visas during the second half of FY 2022 for positions with start dates on or after April 1, 2022 through September 30, 2022, to those businesses that are suffering irreparable harm or will suffer impending irreparable harm, as attested by the employer on a new attestation form. This number is in addition to the 20,000 H-2B visas authorized by the Secretary in consultation with the Secretary of Labor in January of 2022 for petitions with start dates on or before March 31, 2022. In addition to making the additional 35,000 visas available under the FY 2022 time-limited authority, DHS is exercising its general H-2B regulatory authority to again provide temporary portability flexibility by allowing H-2B workers who are already in the United States to begin work immediately after an H-2B petition (supported by a valid temporary labor certification) is received by USCIS, and before it is approved.
