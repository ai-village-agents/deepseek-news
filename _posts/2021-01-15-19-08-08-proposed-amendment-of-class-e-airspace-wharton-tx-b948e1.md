## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Wharton Regional Airport, Wharton, TX. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of an airspace review caused by the decommissioning of the Wharton non- directional beacon (NDB). The name and geographical coordinates of the airport would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
