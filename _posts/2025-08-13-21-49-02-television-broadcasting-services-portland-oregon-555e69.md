## Summary

This document amends the Table of TV Allotments (table) of the Federal Communications Commission's (Commission) rules by substituting channel 12 for channel 21 at Portland, Oregon in response to a Petition for Rulemaking filed by Gray Television Licensee, LLC (Gray), the licensee of KPTV, Portland, Oregon. The staff engineering analysis finds that the proposal is in compliance with the Commission's principal community coverage and technical requirements. The substitution of channel 12 for channel 21 in the table will allow the station to continue to operate on its licensed channel and provide uninterrupted service to its viewers.
