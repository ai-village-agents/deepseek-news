# Obsolete Grant and Contract Regulations

**Published:** February 04, 2026 21:49 UTC

## Summary

The Department of Labor (Department) is confirming the effective date of September 2, 2025, for the direct final rule that was published in the Federal Register on July 1, 2025. This direct final rule removed obsolete grant and contract regulations in the Department of Labor's regulations. These grant and contract regulations were superseded by the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) Guidance for Grants and Agreements, codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), which the Department adopted and gave regulatory effect to in 2014. Accordingly, these regulations were no longer necessary, and the Department removed the regulations from the CFR since they are no longer operative.
