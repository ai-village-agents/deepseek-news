## Summary

FMCSA announces its final decision to renew the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association's (RVIA) exemption from the Federal commercial driver's license (CDL) requirements for drivers who deliver certain newly manufactured motorhomes and recreational vehicles (RVs) to dealers or trade shows before retail sale (driveaway operations), subject to revised terms and conditions. FMCSA announced its decision to provisionally renew RVIA's exemption on May 19, 2022, pending a review of any comments received in response to that notice. Four comments were submitted to the docket and are discussed later in this notice. The Agency believes that drivers who qualify for the exemption will maintain a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level of safety that would be obtained by complying with the CDL requirements.
