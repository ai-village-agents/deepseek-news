## Summary

This action amends Special Condition No. 33-015-SC for the CFM International (CFM) Model LEAP-1A and LEAP-1C engines. These engines have a novel or unusual design feature associated with the engine fan blades--incorporation of woven composite fan blades. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions, as amended, contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
