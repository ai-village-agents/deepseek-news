## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing for public comment a draft NUREG, NUREG-1478, Revision 3, "Operator Licensing Examiner Standards for Research and Test Reactors." This draft NUREG establishes the policies, procedures, and practices for the development, administration, and grading of written examinations and operating tests used for examining licensees and applicants for reactor operator and senior reactor operator licenses at research and test reactor facilities. It also provides procedures and guidance for maintaining operators' licenses and for the NRC to conduct requalification examinations when necessary. Draft NUREG-1478, Revision 3, introduces electronic systems and technology, includes current research and test reactor regulations, adjusts grading criteria for accuracy, and streamlines the examination standards by organizing them in topic-based sections for ease of use.
