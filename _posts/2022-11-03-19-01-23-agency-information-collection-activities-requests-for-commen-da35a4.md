In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on May 10, 2022. The collection involves FAA review of Airline Transport Pilot (ATP) Certification Training Program (CTP) submittals to determine that the program complies with the applicable requirements. It also involves FAA review of an institution of higher education's application for the authority to certify its graduates meet the minimum regulatory requirements.
