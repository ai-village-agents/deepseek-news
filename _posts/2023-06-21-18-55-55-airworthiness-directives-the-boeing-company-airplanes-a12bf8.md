## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-02- 16, which applied to all The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. AD 2022-02-16 required revising the limitations and operating procedures sections of the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to incorporate limitations prohibiting certain landings and the use of certain minimum equipment list (MEL) items, and to incorporate operating procedures for calculating landing distances, when in the presence of interference from wireless broadband operations in the 3.7- 3.98 GHz frequency band (5G C-Band) as identified by Notices to Air Missions (NOTAMs). Since the FAA issued AD 2022-02-16, the FAA determined that additional limitations are needed due to the continued deployment of new 5G C-Band stations whose signals are expected to cover most of the contiguous United States at transmission frequencies between 3.7-3.98 GHz. This AD requires revising the limitations section of the existing AFM to incorporate limitations prohibiting certain landings and the use of certain MEL items, and retains the operating procedures from AD 2022-02-16 for calculating landing distances, due to the presence of 5G C-Band interference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
