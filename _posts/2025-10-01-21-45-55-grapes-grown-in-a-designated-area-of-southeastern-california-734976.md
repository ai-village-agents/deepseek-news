## Summary

This proposed rule would implement a recommendation from the California Desert Grape Administrative Committee (Committee) to decrease the assessment rate established for the 2025 and subsequent fiscal periods from $0.040 to $0.030 per 18-pound lug of grapes grown in a designated area of southeastern California. The proposed assessment rate would remain in effect indefinitely unless modified, suspended, or terminated.
