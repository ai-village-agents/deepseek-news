## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce the Fiscal Year 2018 priority list of wildlife and sport fish conservation projects from the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (Association). As required by the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Programs Improvement Act of 2000, the Association submits a list of projects to us each year to consider for funding under the Multistate Conservation Grant Program. Once projects are awarded, this list must be published into the Federal Register. We have reviewed the list and recommended all projects on the list for award to the Service Director. The Service Director approved the entire list of projects for award, and we have awarded all projects from the list.
