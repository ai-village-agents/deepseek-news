## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the Department of Transportation's (DOT) Office of the Secretary (OST) announces its plan to submit the Information Collection Request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review and approval and invites public comment. The Executive Order, "Setting Customer Service Standards," directs Federal agencies to provide service to the public that matches or exceeds the best service available in the private sector. In order to work continuously to ensure that our programs are effective and meet our customers' needs, the Department of Transportation (DOT) seeks a renewal without revision to a fast track generic clearance information collection request already approved by OMB. OST requests renewal without revision of ICR with OMB Control Number: 2105-0573 as described below. We published a Federal Register Notice with a 60-day public comment period on this information collection on May 24, 2022. We are required to publish this notice in the Federal Register by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
