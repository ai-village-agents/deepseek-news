## Summary

As a result of these second expedited sunset reviews, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) finds that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) orders on welded stainless steel pressure pipe (welded pipe) from Malaysia, Thailand and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (Vietnam) would be likely to lead to the continuation or recurrence of dumping at the levels indicated in the "Final Results of Second Sunset Reviews" section of this notice.
