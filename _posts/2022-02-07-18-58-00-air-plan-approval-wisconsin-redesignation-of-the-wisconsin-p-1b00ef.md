## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to find that the Wisconsin portion of the Chicago-Naperville, IL-IN-WI area (Chicago area) is attaining the 2008 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS or standard) and to act in accordance with a request from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (Wisconsin or the State) to redesignate the Wisconsin portion of the area to attainment for the 2008 ozone NAAQS, because the request meets the statutory requirements for redesignation under the Clean Air Act (CAA). The Wisconsin portion of the Chicago 2008 ozone area consists of the portion of Kenosha County bounded by the I-94 corridor and the area east to Lake Michigan (Kenosha portion). Wisconsin submitted this request on December 3, 2021. EPA is proposing to approve, as a revision to the Wisconsin State Implementation Plan (SIP), the State's plan for maintaining the 2008 ozone NAAQS through 2035 in the Chicago area. EPA also finds adequate and is proposing to approve Wisconsin's 2025 and 2030 volatile organic compound (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) Motor Vehicle Emission Budgets (MVEBs) for the Kenosha portion. Finally, pursuant to section 110 and part D of the CAA, EPA is proposing to approve the enhanced Inspection/Maintenance (I/M) program performance modeling analysis included in Wisconsin's December 3, 2021 submittals, because it satisfies the serious enhanced I/M requirements for the Kenosha portion.
