## Summary

The FAA announces a limited, conditional waiver of the minimum usage requirement that applies to Operating Authorizations or "slots" at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), New York LaGuardia Airport (LGA), and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) due to post-pandemic effects on Air Traffic Controller (ATC) staffing at the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facility (N90). In addition, the FAA is announcing a limited policy for prioritizing returned operations at Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) due to post-pandemic effects on ATC staffing at N90 for purposes of establishing a carrier's operational baseline in the next corresponding season.
