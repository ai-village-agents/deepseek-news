## Summary

Notice is hereby given that the Navajo Nation revised its approved Public Water System Supervision (PWSS) Program under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) by adopting the Radionuclides Rule. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined that these revisions by the Navajo Nation are no less stringent than the corresponding Federal regulations and otherwise meet applicable SDWA primacy requirements. Therefore, the EPA intends to approve the stated revisions to the Navajo Nation's PWSS Program.
