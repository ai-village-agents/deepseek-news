## Summary

The Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily determines that imports of certain uncoated paper rolls from Australia were not completed by conversion into sheets of paper in the United States and, therefore, such imports are not circumventing the antidumping duty (AD) order on certain uncoated paper products from Australia, within the meaning of section 781(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). We invite interested parties to comment on this preliminary determination.
