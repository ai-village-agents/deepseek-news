## Summary

As part of the Federal Trade Commission's ("FTC" or "Commission") regulatory review of the Telemarketing Sales Rule ("TSR" or "Rule"), the Commission issues this advance notice of proposed rulemaking ("ANPR") to seek public comment on whether the Rule should continue to exempt telemarketing calls to businesses, whether the Rule should require a notice and cancelation mechanism with negative option sales, and whether to extend the Rule to apply to telemarketing calls that consumers initiate to a telemarketer (i.e., "inbound telemarketing calls") regarding computer technical support services.
