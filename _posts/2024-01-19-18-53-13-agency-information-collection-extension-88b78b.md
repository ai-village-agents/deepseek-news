## Summary

The Department of Energy (DOE) has submitted an information collection request to the OMB for extension under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The information collection requests a 3-year extension of Western Area Power Administration's (WAPA) Applicant Profile Data (APD), OMB Control Number 1910-5136. The proposed collection is necessary for the proper performance of WAPA's functions. WAPA markets a limited amount of Federal hydropower. Due to the high demand for WAPA's power, WAPA needs the ability to collect information under the information collection request in order to evaluate who may receive an allocation of Federal power pursuant to specific marketing plans. This APD public process only determines the information WAPA will collect in its information collection request. The actual allocation of Federal power will be conducted through a separate marketing plan process outside the scope of this APD process.
