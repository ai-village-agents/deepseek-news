## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports from multiple operators of pitch oscillations events due to excessive horizontal stabilizer freeplay. This proposed AD would require measuring the freeplay of the horizontal stabilizer pivot hinges and the jackscrew, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
