## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-07- 17, which applied to all Saab AB, Support and Services Model SAAB 2000 airplanes. AD 2020-07-17 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-07- 17, it has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2020- 07-17 and requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
