## Summary

On October 22, 2012, the EPA published a final rule in the Federal Register promulgating a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) to address regional haze obligations for the Territory of the United States Virgin Islands. However, at that time, EPA erroneously failed to incorporate into the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) certain emission limits that had been determined to be necessary to satisfy those obligations and that had been proposed and included in the docket for the action. EPA is correcting this error by incorporating the previously noticed limits into the CFR. EPA has not reopened any of the previous, underlying determinations in this action.
