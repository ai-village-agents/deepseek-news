## Summary

The OCC, Board, FDIC, FCA, and NCUA (collectively, the Agencies) are reorganizing, revising, and expanding the Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Flood Insurance. This revised guidance will assist lenders in meeting their responsibilities under Federal flood insurance law and increase public understanding of the Agencies' respective flood insurance regulations. Significant topics addressed by the revisions include guidance related to major amendments to the flood insurance laws with regard to the escrow of flood insurance premiums, the detached structure exemption, force placement procedures, and the acceptance of flood insurance policies issued by private insurers. With this issuance, the Agencies are consolidating the Questions and Answers proposed by the Agencies in July 2020 and the Questions and Answers proposed by the Agencies in March 2021 into one set of Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Flood Insurance.
