## Summary

The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS), with the concurrence of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), is issuing this final rule for FMCS employees. This rule supplements the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (OGE Standards) issued by OGE and is necessary because it addresses ethical issues unique to the FMCS. This rule sets forth prior approval requirements for certain outside employment and outside activities for all FMCS employees, other than special government employees.
