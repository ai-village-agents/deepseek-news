## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-22-04, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A318-111, -112, -121, and -122 airplanes, Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes, Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and - 233 airplanes, and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2021-22-04 requires a one-time eddy current conductivity measurement of certain structural parts of the outer flaps to determine if the incorrect alloy was used, and replacement if necessary; and also requires a one-time eddy current conductivity measurement of certain other structural parts of the outer flaps to determine if the parts were properly heat treated, and replacement if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-22-04, typographical errors have been identified regarding serial numbers of certain suspected parts, and it was determined that inconsistent serial numbers formats have been used to identify certain suspected parts. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2021-22-04, and would require using an updated list of suspected parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. This proposed AD would also limit the installation of affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
