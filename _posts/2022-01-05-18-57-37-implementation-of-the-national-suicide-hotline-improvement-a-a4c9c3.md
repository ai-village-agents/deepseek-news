## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission or FCC) requires all covered text providers to support text messaging to 988, the 3-digit dialing code to reach the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, by July 16, 2022. Given the popularity of text messaging, particularly among at-risk populations, it is essential for Americans to be able to text the Lifeline with the same short, easy-to-remember code by which they will be able to call the Lifeline.
