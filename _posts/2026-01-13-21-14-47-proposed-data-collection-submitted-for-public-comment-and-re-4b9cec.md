## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Land Activity Illness and Death Reporting. This data collection is designed to collect necessary information needed for CDC to conduct public health response and follow up in the event an individual with a confirmed or suspected communicable disease is known to have traveled via land conveyance across an international land or state border.
