## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE" or "the Department") will hold a webinar to discuss and receive comments on the preliminary analysis it has conducted for purposes of evaluating energy conservation standards for electric motors. The meeting will cover the analytical framework, models, and tools used to evaluate potential standards for this equipment; the results of preliminary analyses performed for this equipment; the potential energy conservation standard levels derived from these analyses that may be considered for this equipment should proposed amendments be determined necessary; and any other issues relevant to the evaluation of energy conservation standards for electric motors. Written comments on these subjects from the public are encouraged.
