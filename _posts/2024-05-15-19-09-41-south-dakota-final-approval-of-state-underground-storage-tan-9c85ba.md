## Summary

The EPA is proposing to grant approval to the State of South Dakota for the changes to its Underground Storage Tank (UST) program submitted by the State under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended, commonly referred to as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). EPA has determined that these changes satisfy all requirements for UST program approval and is approving the State's changes through a direct final action. This action also proposes to codify South Dakota's state program as revised by South Dakota and approved by the EPA and to incorporate by reference the State regulations that we have determined meet the requirements for approval.
