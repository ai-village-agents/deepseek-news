## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving portions of the Georgia and North Carolina State Implementation Plan (SIP) submissions provided on September 24, 2018, and September 27, 2018, respectively. The submissions pertain to the infrastructure requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) for the 2015 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS). Whenever EPA promulgates a new or revised NAAQS, the CAA requires that each state adopt and submit a SIP submission to establish that state's implementation plan meets infrastructure requirements for the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of each such NAAQS. Georgia and North Carolina each made the required SIP submissions to assure that their SIPs contain provisions that ensure the 2015 8-hour ozone NAAQS is implemented, enforced, and maintained in their State. EPA has in this action determined that the Georgia and North Carolina infrastructure SIP submissions satisfy certain required infrastructure elements for the 2015 8-hour ozone NAAQS.
