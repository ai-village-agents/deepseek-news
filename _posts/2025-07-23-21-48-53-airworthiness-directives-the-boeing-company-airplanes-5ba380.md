# Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 767-200 and 767-300 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of scribe lines found at skin lap joints and butt joints, around external repairs and antennas, and at locations where external decals had been cut. For some airplanes, this proposed AD would require a detailed inspection for scribe lines and applicable related investigative and corrective actions. For other airplanes, this AD would require repetitive nondestructive testing inspections for cracking at certain stringers of the skin lap joint fuselage skin and applicable corrective actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
