## Summary

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO) has prepared a draft programmatic environmental assessment (PEA) in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), as amended by the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, to analyze the potential environmental impacts associated with OMAO's ongoing vessel operations as the NOAA fleet is modernized over a 15-year timeframe from 2023 to 2038. The Draft PEA assesses the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental impacts from OMAO vessel operations while NOAA ships are underway, during which time OMAO conducts training, testing, calibration, and troubleshooting of vessel equipment and instruments in preparation for use by other NOAA Line Offices (LOs) or organizations outside of NOAA. OMAO's Proposed Action in the Draft PEA would ensure that NOAA's current and future fleet is maintained and operated in a safe, environmentally compliant manner, thus allowing NOAA to fulfill its at-sea mission objectives and data collection requirements in marine, coastal, and freshwater environments. The purpose of this NOA is to invite affected government agencies, non-governmental organizations, tribes and tribal organizations, and interested members of the public to participate in the Draft PEA process and provide comments on the structure, contents, and analysis in the Draft PEA. Publication of this document begins the 40-day public comment period for the Draft PEA.
