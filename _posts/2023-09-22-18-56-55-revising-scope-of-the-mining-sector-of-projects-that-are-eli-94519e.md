## Summary

The Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (Permitting Council) proposes to amend its regulations to revise the scope of "mining" as a sector with infrastructure projects eligible for coverage under Title 41 of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST-41). The Permitting Council added "mining" as a FAST-41 sector in January 2021. This proposed rule would: (1) revise the FAST-41 "mining" sector to apply solely to critical minerals mining projects; and (2) expand the scope of the sector to include infrastructure constructed to support critical minerals supply chain activities, including critical minerals beneficiation, processing, and recycling. The proposed modification will help ensure that qualified critical minerals supply chain projects beyond critical minerals mining can obtain FAST-41 coverage. FAST-41 was enacted to improve the timeliness, predictability, transparency, and accountability of the Federal environmental review and authorization processes for covered infrastructure projects. FAST-41 coverage does not predetermine or affect the outcome of any Federal decision-making process with respect to a covered project, or modify any required environmental review or public or tribal consultation process.
