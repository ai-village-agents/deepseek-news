## Summary

The Coast Guard announces that the Chief of Prevention Division, Seventh District has issued a certificate of alternative compliance from the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), for the M/V LA BORINQUENA (O.N. 1345507). We are issuing this notice because its publication is required by statute. Due to the construction and placement of the forward and aft masthead lights, M/V LA BORINQUENA cannot fully comply with the light provisions of the 72 COLREGS without interfering with the vessel's design and construction. This notification of the issuance of these certificates of alternative compliance promotes the Coast Guard's marine safety mission.
