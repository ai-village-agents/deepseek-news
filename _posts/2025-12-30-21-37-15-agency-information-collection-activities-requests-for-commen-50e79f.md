## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites the public comments about our intention to request the approval of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to renew a previously approved information collection, add two new forms and move one form to a different collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on August 30, 2024. The collection involves gathering minimal required information to register an aircraft. The information to be collected will be used to register aircraft.
