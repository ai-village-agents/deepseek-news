## Summary

On May 21, 2021, the Media Bureau, Video Division (Bureau) issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in response to a petition for rulemaking filed by Scripps Broadcasting Holdings, LLC (Scripps or Licensee), the licensee of KTNV-TV, channel 7, Las Vegas, Nevada, requesting the substitution of channel 26 for channel 13 at Las Vegas, in the Table of TV Allotments. King Kong Broadcasting, Inc. (King Kong), the licensee of low power television station KGNG-LD on channel 26 at Las Vegas, filed opposition comments and counter-proposed that channel 26 instead be allotted as a new vacant channel at Las Vegas. For the reasons set forth in the Report and Order referenced below, the Bureau denies King Kong's opposition and counter-proposal, amends FCC regulations to substitute channel 26 for channel 13 at Las Vegas, and directs Scripps to file an application for a construction permit for channel 26.
