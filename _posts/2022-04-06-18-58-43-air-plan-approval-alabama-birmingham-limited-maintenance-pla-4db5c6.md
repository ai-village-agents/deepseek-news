## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Alabama, through the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM), via a letter dated September 15, 2020. The SIP revision includes the 1997 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) Limited Maintenance Plan (LMP) for the Birmingham, Alabama Area (hereinafter referred to as the "Birmingham Area" or "Area"). The Birmingham Area is comprised of Jefferson and Shelby Counties. EPA is approving the Birmingham Area LMP because it provides for the maintenance of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS within the Birmingham Area through the end of the second 10-year portion of the maintenance period. This action makes certain commitments related to maintenance of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS in the Birmingham Area federally enforceable as part of the Alabama SIP.
