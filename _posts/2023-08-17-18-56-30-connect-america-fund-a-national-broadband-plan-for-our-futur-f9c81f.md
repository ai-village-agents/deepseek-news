## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) adopts the Enhanced Alternative Connect America Cost Model (A-CAM) program as a voluntary path for supporting the widespread deployment of 100/20 Mbps broadband service throughout the rural areas served by carriers currently receiving A-CAM support and in areas served by legacy rate-of-return support recipients. In adopting this program, the Commission furthers its long-standing goals by promoting the universal availability of voice and broadband networks, while also taking measures to minimize the burden on the nation's ratepayers.
