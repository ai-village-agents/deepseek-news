## Summary

The Department of Energy ("DOE") is publishing a rule that establishes energy performance standards for the new construction and major renovation of Federal buildings, including commercial buildings, multi-family high-rise residential buildings, and low-rise residential buildings per the Energy Conservation and Production Act ("ECPA"), as amended by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 ("EISA"). Consistent with the requirements of ECPA and EISA, DOE is establishing Federal building energy performance standards that require Federal agencies to reduce their use of on-site use of fossil fuels (which include coal, petroleum, natural gas, oil shales, bitumens, tar sands, and heavy oils) consistent with the targets of ECPA and EISA. This final rule also provides processes by which Federal agencies may petition DOE for a modification to the final standards.
