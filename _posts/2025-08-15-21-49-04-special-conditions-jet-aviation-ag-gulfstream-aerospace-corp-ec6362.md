## Summary

These special conditions are issued for the Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation (Gulfstream) Model GVI airplane. This airplane, as modified by Jet Aviation AG, will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport-category airplanes. This design feature is an oxygen distribution system that provides a shared source of oxygen between the flightcrew and passengers to provide supplemental and therapeutic oxygen. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
