## Summary

The Board and the FDIC (together, the "agencies") are inviting comments on proposed guidance for the 2021 and subsequent resolution plan submissions by certain foreign banking organizations ("FBOs"). The proposed guidance is meant to assist these firms in developing their resolution plans, which are required to be submitted pursuant to Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"). The scope of application of the proposed guidance would be FBOs that are triennial full filers and whose intermediate holding companies ("U.S. IHCs") have a score of 250 or more under the second methodology ("method 2") of the global systemically important bank ("GSIB") surcharge framework. The proposed guidance, which is largely based on prior guidance, describes the agencies' expectations regarding a number of key vulnerabilities in plans for a rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (i.e., capital; liquidity; governance mechanisms; operational; legal entity rationalization and separability; and derivatives and trading activities). The proposed guidance also updates certain aspects of prior guidance based, in part, on the agencies' review of certain FBOs' most recent resolution plan submissions and changes to the resolution planning rule. The agencies invite public comment on all aspects of the proposed guidance.
