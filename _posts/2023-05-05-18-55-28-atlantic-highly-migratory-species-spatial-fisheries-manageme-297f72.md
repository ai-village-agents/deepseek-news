## Summary

This proposed rule would implement Draft Amendment 15 to the 2006 Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species (HMS) Fishery Management Plan (FMP) (Amendment 15). NMFS is proposing changes to Atlantic HMS fishery management measures regarding four commercial longline spatial management areas and the administration and funding of the HMS pelagic longline electronic monitoring (EM) program. Specifically, NMFS proposes to modify the timing and boundaries of the Mid-Atlantic shark, Charleston Bump, East Florida Coast, and DeSoto Canyon closed areas to create low- and/or high-bycatch risk areas. Lastly, NMFS proposes to implement a cost allocation program to transition electronic monitoring sampling costs to the industry, while NMFS remains responsible for administrative costs. These proposed changes would directly impact bottom and pelagic longline fishermen who hold Atlantic HMS fishing permits, and HMS commercial fishermen who use other gear types and HMS recreational fishermen may also be indirectly impacted given the proposed changes to the existing closed areas.
