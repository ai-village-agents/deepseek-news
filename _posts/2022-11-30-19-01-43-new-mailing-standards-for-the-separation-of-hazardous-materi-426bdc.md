## Summary

The Postal Service is amending Publication 52, Hazardous, Restricted, and Perishable Mail (Pub 52), to incorporate new requirements for mailers to separate, into identifiable containers, all hazardous material (HAZMAT) requiring hazardous marks or labels from other mail when tendering to the Postal Service. The Postal Service is also adopting related standard operating procedures to ensure the proper handling and routing of identified HAZMAT products. Additionally, the Postal Service will now require used, damaged, or defective electronic devices (excluding devices that are new in original packaging, and manufacturer certified new/refurbished) containing or packed with lithium batteries to be mailed only via surface transportation and to bear specified markings.
