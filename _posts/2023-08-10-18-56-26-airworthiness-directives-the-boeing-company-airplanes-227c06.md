## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 737 airplanes equipped with CFM International, S.A. (CFM) Model LEAP-1B series turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by a report indicating that use of engine anti-ice (EAI) in dry air for more than five minutes during certain environmental and operational conditions can cause overheating of the engine inlet inner barrel beyond the material design limit, resulting in failure of the engine inlet inner barrel and severe engine inlet cowl damage. This AD requires revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to limit the use of EAI in certain conditions and revising the operator's existing minimum equipment list to prohibit dispatch under a certain item. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
