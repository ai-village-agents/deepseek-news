## Summary

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act or the Act) authorizes the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) to issue regulations for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) administered by the Small Business Administration (SBA), including regulations that allow additional lenders to originate loans and establish terms and conditions. In this interim final rule, Treasury authorizes all lenders eligible to originate loans under the PPP to use an alternative criterion for calculating the maximum loan amount for PPP loans issued to seasonal employers.
