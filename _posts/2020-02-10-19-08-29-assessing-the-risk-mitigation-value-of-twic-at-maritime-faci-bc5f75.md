## Summary

By law, the Secretary of Homeland Security is required to commission an assessment of how effective the transportation security card program is at enhancing security and reducing security risks for regulated maritime facilities and vessels. Through the transportation security card program, the Department issues the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC[supreg]). Legislation passed August 2, 2018 restricts the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) from implementing any rule requiring the use of biometric readers for TWIC[supreg] until after submission to Congress of the results of this effectiveness assessment. The Homeland Security Operational Analysis Center (HSOAC), a federally funded research and development center operated by the RAND Corporation, will collect information from those involved in maritime security on behalf of the DHS S&T Office of Innovation and Collaboration (OIC) Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) Program Management Office. HSOAC will visit regulated maritime facilities and terminals and conduct interviews using a semi-structured interview method to collect information. HSOAC will analyze this information and use it to produce a public report with its research findings.
