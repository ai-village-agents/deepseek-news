Note, the list of 15 established advisory councils in the Contact Information for Each Site section includes the advisory council established for the Proposed Lake Ontario National Marine Sanctuary and excludes an advisory council for the recently designated Mallows Bay-Potomac River National Marine Sanctuary since an advisory has not yet been established.
