## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) permanently debarring Martin Valdes, M.D., from providing services in any capacity to a person that has an approved or pending drug product application. FDA bases this order on a finding that Dr. Valdes was convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct relating to the development or approval, including the process for development or approval, of any drug product under the FD&C Act. Dr. Valdes was given notice of the proposed permanent debarment and an opportunity to request a hearing to show why he should not be debarred. As of January 7, 2023 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Dr. Valdes had not responded. Dr. Valdes's failure to respond and request a hearing within the prescribed timeframe constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this action.
