## Summary

The formula rate for the Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP) Management Center's (MC) Olmsted Powerplant Replacement Project (Olmsted Project) has been confirmed, approved, and placed into effect on an interim basis (Provisional Formula Rate). The new formula rate, under Rate Schedule Olmsted F-2, replaces the existing formula rate for this service, under Rate Schedule Olmsted F-1, which expires on May 6, 2023. A change was made to the definition of Formula Rate in the Rate Schedule F-2 to reflect that the Annual Revenue Requirement is multiplied by the Customer's allocation percentage. The new formula rate under Rate Schedule Olmsted F-2 is effective May 1, 2023, through April 30, 2028.
