## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, Agency, or we) is amending and repealing parts of the radiological health regulations covering recommendations for radiation protection during medical procedures, certain records and reporting for electronic products, and performance standards for diagnostic x-ray systems and their major components, laser products, and ultrasonic therapy products. The Agency is taking this action to clarify and update the regulations to reduce regulatory requirements that are outdated and duplicate other means to better protect the public health against harmful exposure to radiation emitting electronic products and medical devices.
