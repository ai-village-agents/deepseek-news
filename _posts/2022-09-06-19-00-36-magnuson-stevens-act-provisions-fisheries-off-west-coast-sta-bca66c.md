## Summary

NMFS announces that the Pacific Fishery Management Council has submitted Amendment 30 to the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan to the Secretary of Commerce for review. If approved, Amendment 30 would specify a shortbelly rockfish catch threshold to initiate Council review; extend the length of the limited entry fixed gear sablefish primary season; change the use of Rockfish Conservation Area boundaries; expand the use of Block Area Closures to control catch of groundfish; and correct the definition of Block Area Closures. Amendment 30 is necessary to help prevent overfishing, rebuild overfished stocks, achieve optimum yield, and ensure management measures are based on the best scientific information available. It is intended to promote the goals and objectives of the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan.
