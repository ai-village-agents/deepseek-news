## Summary

The Department of Transportation (DOT) requests public comment on how its regulations for conducting workplace drug and alcohol testing for the federally regulated transportation industry could be amended to allow electronic signatures on documents required to be created and utilized under the regulations, to be able to use electronic versions of forms, and to electronically store forms and data. The regulatory changes would apply to DOT-regulated employers and their contractors ("service agents") who administer their DOT- regulated drug and alcohol testing programs. Currently, employers and their service agents must use, sign and store paper documents exclusively, unless the employer is utilizing a laboratory's electronic Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Form (electronic CCF) system that has been approved by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). DOT is required by statute to amend its regulations to authorize, to the extent practicable, the use of electronic signatures or digital signatures executed to electronic forms instead of traditional handwritten signatures executed on paper forms. This rulemaking also responds to an April 2, 2020, petition for rulemaking from DISA Global Solutions, Inc. (DISA), requesting that part 40 be amended to allow the use of an electronic version of the alcohol testing form (ATF) for DOT-authorized alcohol testing. The information received in response to this ANPRM will assist DOT in the development of proposed regulatory amendments intended to provide additional flexibility and reduced costs for the industry while maintaining the integrity and confidentiality requirements of the drug and alcohol testing regulations.
