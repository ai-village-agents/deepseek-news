## Summary

This proposed rule would prohibit civil aircraft operations conducted with supplemental restraint systems (SRS) unless operators meet certain requirements for ensuring passenger safety during all phases of the operation. The FAA expects these proposed requirements would increase the safety of passengers during civil aircraft operations conducted with SRS. This proposal addresses recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board and the Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General. Additionally, this proposed rule would codify, with updates, an Emergency Order currently in effect addressing safety concerns regarding the use of supplemental restraints. The proposed rule would apply to all civil aircraft operations conducted with use of SRS. The rule as proposed would not apply to parachute operations or rotorcraft external-load operations. Additionally, the proposed rule would not apply to operations conducted as public aircraft operations.
