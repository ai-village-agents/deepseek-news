## Summary

Commander, Coast Guard Arctic District, has issued a permit exempting a vessel from requirements in 46 CFR when transporting cargo, including bulk fuel, within Alaska. Permits temporarily waive vessel inspection requirements to facilitate the movement of cargo, including bulk fuel, to remote Alaskan sites not serviced by fuel barge throughout Southeast Alaska. Remote Made Easy, LLC, the operator of M/V REMOTE SUPPLIER (O.N. 1200932) received a single permit allowing the vessel to conduct on-going bulk fuel deliveries of up to a total of 3,000 gallons, consisting of heating oil and diesel, carried in integral cargo tanks, and gasoline, that may be carried in approved portable tanks on deck. The permit expires on 27 March 2026. This notification of issuance of a permit promotes the Coast Guard's marine safety mission and the flow of essential cargo to remote sites.
