## Summary

As a result of the determinations by the Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the International Trade Commission (ITC) that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) orders on narrow woven ribbons with woven selvedge (NWRs) from the People's Republic of China (China) and Taiwan and the countervailing duty (CVD) order on NWRs from China would likely lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping and net countervailable subsidies, and material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is publishing this notice of continuation of the AD orders and the CVD order.
