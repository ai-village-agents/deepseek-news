## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Airbus Helicopters Model AS350B, AS350BA, AS350B1, AS350B2, AS350B3, AS350D, AS355E, AS355F, AS355F1, AS355F2, AS355N, and AS355NP helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a sliding door that was locked in the open position detaching from the helicopter during flight. This proposed AD would require modifying certain upper rail rollers, installing a label on each sliding door, and prohibit installing affected upper rail rollers or a door having an affected upper rail roller. These actions are specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
