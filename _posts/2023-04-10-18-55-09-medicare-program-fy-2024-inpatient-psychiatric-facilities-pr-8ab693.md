## Summary

This proposed rule would update the prospective payment rates, the outlier threshold, and the wage index for Medicare inpatient hospital services provided by Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities (IPF), which include psychiatric hospitals and excluded psychiatric units of an acute care hospital or critical access hospital. These proposed changes would be effective for IPF discharges occurring during the Fiscal Year (FY) beginning October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024 (FY 2024). In addition, this proposed rule discusses proposals on quality measures and reporting requirements under the Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities Quality Reporting (IPFQR) Program with proposed changes beginning with the FY 2024 payment determination through changes beginning with the FY 2028 payment determination.
