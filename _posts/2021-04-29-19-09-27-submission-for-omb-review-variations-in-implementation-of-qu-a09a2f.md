## Summary

The Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation (OPRE), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is requesting a 3-year extension with changes to continue collecting data for the study Variations in Implementation of Quality Interventions (VIQI). In addition to extending data collection, OPRE proposes to update burden estimates to accommodate a different sample size of centers, administrators, teachers, and coaches; to revise data collection instruments and activities for the impact evaluation and process study in line with lessons learned during the pilot study; to add a second timepoint of data collection for the teacher reports to questions about children; to provide one new instrument to collect parent report of children's skills and behaviors; and to provide one new instrument in anticipation of COVID-19 necessitating further information gathering to contextualize findings from the impact evaluation and process study.
