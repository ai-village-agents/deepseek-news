## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of North Carolina, through the North Carolina Division of Air Quality (NCDAQ), via a letter dated December 9, 2021. The SIP revision includes the 1997 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) Limited Maintenance Plan (LMP) for the North Carolina portion (hereinafter referred to as the Metrolina Area) of the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill NC-SC 1997 8-hour ozone maintenance area (hereinafter referred to as the "Charlotte NC-SC 1997 8-hour NAAQS Area"). The Charlotte NC-SC 1997 8-hour NAAQS Area is comprised of Cabarrus, Gaston, Lincoln, Mecklenburg, Rowan, and Union Counties and a portion of Iredell County (i.e., Coddle Creek and Davidson Townships) in North Carolina; and the Rock Hill Metropolitan Planning Organization boundary in York County, South Carolina. EPA is proposing to approve the Metrolina Area LMP because it provides for the maintenance of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS within the Metrolina Area through the end of the second 10-year portion of the maintenance period in 2034. The effect of this action would be to make certain commitments related to maintenance of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS in the Metrolina Area federally enforceable as part of the North Carolina SIP.
