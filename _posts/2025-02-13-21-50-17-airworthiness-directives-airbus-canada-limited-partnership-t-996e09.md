## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD- 500-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by certification testing that found that environmental control system (ECS) ducts manufactured using a certain material failed the flammability test requirements established for compliance. This proposed AD would require inspecting the affected ECS ducts and, as applicable, installing a fire-resistant sleeve assembly over any non-compliant ECS duct, and prohibit the installation of ECS ducts as replacement parts under certain conditions, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
