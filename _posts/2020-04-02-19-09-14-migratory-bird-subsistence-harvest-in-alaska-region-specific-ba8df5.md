## Summary

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service or we) is establishing regulations for the subsistence harvest of migratory birds in Alaska for the 2020 season and beyond. These regulations allow for the continuation of customary and traditional subsistence uses of migratory birds in Alaska and prescribe regional information on when and where the harvesting of birds may occur. These regulations were developed under a co-management process involving the Service, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, and Alaska Native representatives and are subject to public review. Based on any comments received, we may revise this interim rule. The Alaska subsistence harvest season begins on April 2, 2020.
