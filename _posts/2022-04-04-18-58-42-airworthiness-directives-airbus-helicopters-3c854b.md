## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model EC130T2 helicopters. This AD was prompted by the determination of a certain part needing a life limit and re- identification. This AD requires re-identifying a certain part-numbered engine-to-main gearbox (engine-MGB) coupling shaft, and creating a log card or equivalent record, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
