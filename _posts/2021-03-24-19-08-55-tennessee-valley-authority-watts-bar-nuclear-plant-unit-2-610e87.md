## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. NPF-96, issued to Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), for operation of the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant (Watts Bar or WBN), Unit 2. The proposed amendment would revise the Watts Bar Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) to apply a temperature adjustment to the growth rate calculation used to determine the end-of-cycle distribution of indications of axial outer diameter stress corrosion cracking (ODSCC) at steam generator (SG) tube support plates in support of the Watts Bar, Unit 2 operational assessment. The proposed revision to the UFSAR would apply to Unit 2 only. For this amendment request, the NRC proposes to determine that it involves no significant hazards consideration. Because this amendment request contains sensitive unclassified non- safeguards information (SUNSI), an order imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI for contention preparation.
