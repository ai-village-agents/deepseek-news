## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to remove Nelson's checker-mallow (Sidalcea nelsoniana) from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Plants. Our review of the best available scientific and commercial data indicates that the threats to Nelson's checker-mallow have been eliminated or reduced to the point that the species no longer meets the definition of an endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). If we finalize this rule as proposed, the prohibitions and conservation measures provided by the Act, particularly through sections 7 and 9, would no longer apply to Nelson's checker-mallow. We request information and comments from the public regarding this proposed rule and the draft post-delisting monitoring (PDM) plan for Nelson's checker-mallow.
