The DECs are closely affiliated with the U.S. Export Assistance Centers (USEACs) of the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS), which is part of the Global Markets unit within the Department's International Trade Administration, and play a key role in the planning and coordination of export activities in their communities.
