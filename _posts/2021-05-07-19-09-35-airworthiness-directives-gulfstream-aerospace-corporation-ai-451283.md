## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation (Gulfstream) Model GVII- G500 airplanes. This proposed AD results from flap yoke fittings with design features that cause decreased fatigue life. This proposed AD would require replacing the flap inboard and outboard yoke fitting assemblies and establishing a 20,000 flight cycle life limit for the fittings. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
