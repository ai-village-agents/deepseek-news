## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) gives notice of availability of the preliminary list of potential National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors (NIETCs). This issuance initiates Phase 2 of the NIETC designation process outlined in the guidance DOE released on December 19, 2023. NIETC designation focuses public and policymaker attention on the areas of greatest transmission need and unlocks valuable Federal financing and permitting tools to advance transmission development. Additional information on one of those tools--Transmission Facility Financing--is also included with the preliminary list.
