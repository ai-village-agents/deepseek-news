## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), determine endangered species status under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended, for the Yangtze sturgeon (Acipenser dabryanus). Loss of individuals due to overharvesting on the Yangtze River is the main factor that contributed to the historical decline of the species. Despite conservation efforts, this species is still currently in decline, due primarily to the effects of dams and bycatch. This rule adds the Yangtze sturgeon to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife.
