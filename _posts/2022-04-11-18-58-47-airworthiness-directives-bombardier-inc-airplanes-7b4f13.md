# Airworthiness Directives; Bombardier, Inc., Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-1A11 (600), CL-600-2A12 (601), and CL-600-2B16 (601-3A, 601-3R, and 604 Variants) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports that during certain operating modes, the flight guidance/autopilot does not account for engine failure while capturing an altitude. This proposed AD would require revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to provide the flightcrew with a new limitation and procedure for operation during certain flight modes. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
