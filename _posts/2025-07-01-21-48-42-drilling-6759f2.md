## Summary

MSHA is proposing to rescind requirements for the maintenance of drill equipment and inspection of drilling areas before starting drilling operations at surface metal and nonmetal mines. Removing these provisions would not reduce protections afforded to miners because the requirements are duplicative and covered elsewhere in 30 CFR part 56.
