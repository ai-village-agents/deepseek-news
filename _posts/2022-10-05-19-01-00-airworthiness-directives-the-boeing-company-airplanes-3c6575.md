## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-8 and 737-9 airplanes, and certain Model 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of damage to the auxiliary power unit (APU) fuel line shroud located in the aft cargo area; investigation revealed that the placement of the pressure switch wire clamp assembly and its fastener allowed interference of the fastener against the APU fuel line shroud. This proposed AD would require inspecting the APU fuel line shroud for damage, inspecting the pressure switch wire clamp for correct bolt orientation and horizontal distance from the APU fuel line shroud, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
