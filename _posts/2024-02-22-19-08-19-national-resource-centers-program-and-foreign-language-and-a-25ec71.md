## Summary

The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations that govern the National Resource Centers (NRC) Program, Assistance Listing Number 84.015A, and the Foreign Language and Area Studies (FLAS) Fellowships Program, Assistance Listing Number 84.015B. The proposed regulations would clarify interpretations of statutory language, redesign the selection criteria, and make necessary updates based upon program management experience. These proposed changes would remove ambiguity and redundancy in the selection criteria and definitions of key terms, improve the application process, and align the administration of these programs with developments in modern foreign language and area studies education. A brief summary of the proposed rule is available on Regulations.gov in the docket for the rulemaking.
