## Summary

On May 16, 2022, the President signed into law the Safe Sleep for Babies Act of 2021 (SSBA), requiring that "inclined sleepers for infants, regardless of the date of manufacture, shall be considered a banned hazardous product" under the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA). Pursuant to this authority, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC, or Commission) is proposing to codify the ban on inclined sleepers for infants.
