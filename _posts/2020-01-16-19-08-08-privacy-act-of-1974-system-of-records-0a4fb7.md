## Summary

The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) is modifying a System of Records Notice (SORN), Security Assistance Network (SAN), DSCA 07. The SAN is an international security cooperation (SC) database and communications network that provides the Security Cooperation Offices (SCOs) and others in the SC community access to SC financial and logistics management systems, information via various bulletin boards, and a library system for sharing large document files. The SAN provides the primary interface for the input and output of data from all military departments, SCOs, and International Military Student Offices (IMSOs). Additionally, the SCO training manager obtains data used for the Security Cooperation Training Management System (SC-TMS) from SAN. All SCOs and IMSOs must use the SAN and its components to perform their assigned SC training management functions.
