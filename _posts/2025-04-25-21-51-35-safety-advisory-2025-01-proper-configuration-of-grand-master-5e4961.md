FRA is issuing Safety Advisory 2025-01 to heighten awareness within the rail industry of the potential for unintended movement of Grand Master 4000 and 4000A switch machines. Improper configuration of these machines could allow power to be present at the switch machine controller when locking is in effect, creating the potential for unintended switch movement underneath or in front of a train.
