## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is making an interim final determination that the State of California has submitted a rule that satisfies the requirements of title I, part D of the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act") permitting program for areas under the jurisdiction of the El Dorado County Air Quality Management District (EDCAQMD or "District"). This determination is based on a proposed approval, published elsewhere in this Federal Register, of a District rule addressing these requirements. The effect of this interim final determination is to defer the imposition of sanctions that were triggered by a previous EPA action that included a limited disapproval of a District rule intended to address title I, Part D requirements.
