## Summary

We are advising the public of our decision to deregulate light brown apple moth (LBAM) for fruit imported from New Zealand into the United States. Currently, fruit imported from New Zealand into the United States must be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate with an additional declaration stating that the fruit is free of LBAM. Based on the findings of a commodity import evaluation document, which we made available to the public for review and comment through a previous notice, we are removing the requirement for the additional declaration. Accordingly, we are revising the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Agricultural Commodity Import Requirements database regarding LBAM requirements for fruit imported from New Zealand into the United States. This change will harmonize our domestic and import requirements.
