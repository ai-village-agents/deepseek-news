## Summary

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has statutory authority to grant an exemption from a regulation if TSA determines the exemption is in the public interest. TSA is granting an exemption from an aviation security regulation to permit eligible airport operators to enter into Exclusive Area Agreements (EAA) with Amazon Air, subject to requirements set forth in the Exemption. Also, TSA is rescinding an exemption issued on July 26, 2021, that permitted three airports to enter into EAAs with Amazon Air, as they are now covered by this exemption.
