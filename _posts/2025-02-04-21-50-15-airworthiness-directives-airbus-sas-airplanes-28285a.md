## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-16- 06, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A330-200, A330-200 Freighter, A330-300, and A330-900 series airplanes; and all Model A340- 200 and A340-300 series airplanes. AD 2022-16-06 required modifying the trimmable horizontal stabilizer actuator (THSA) installation, implementing the electrical load sensing device (ELSD) wiring provisions, and installing and activating the ELSD. This AD was prompted by tests that demonstrated that when the upper secondary load path (SLP) of the THSA is engaged, the THSA might not stall, with consequently no indication of SLP engagement, and by the recent determination that the required actions of AD 2022-16-06 cannot be accomplished on certain airplanes. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2022-16-06 with revised procedures, and also requires additional actions for certain airplanes, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
