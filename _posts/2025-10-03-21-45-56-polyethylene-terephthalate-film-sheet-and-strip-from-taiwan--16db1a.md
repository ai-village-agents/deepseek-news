## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily determines that Nan Ya Plastics Corporation (Nan Ya) made sales of polyethylene terephthalate film, sheet, and strip (PET film) from Taiwan, at less than normal value (NV) during the period of review (POR) July 1, 2023, through June 30, 2024. Further, we preliminarily find that Shinkong Materials Technology Corporation (SMTC) and Shinkong Synthetic Fiber Corporation (SSFC), which we consider to be a single entity (SMTC/SSFC), had no reviewable entries during the POR. Interested parties are invited to comment on the preliminary results of this review.
