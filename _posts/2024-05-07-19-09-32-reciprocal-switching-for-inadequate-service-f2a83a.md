## Summary

The Board adopts new regulations that provide for the prescription of reciprocal switching agreements as a means to promote adequate rail service through access to an additional line haul carrier. Under the new regulations, eligibility for prescription of a reciprocal switching agreement will be determined in part using objective performance standards that address reliability in time of arrival, consistency in transit time, and reliability in providing first-mile and last-mile service. The Board will also consider, in determining whether to prescribe a reciprocal switching agreement, certain affirmative defenses and the practicability of a reciprocal switching agreement. To help implement the new regulations, the Board will require all Class I railroads to submit certain service data on an ongoing and standardized basis, which will be generalized and publicly accessible. Railroads will also be required to provide individualized, machine-readable service data to a customer upon a written request from that customer.
