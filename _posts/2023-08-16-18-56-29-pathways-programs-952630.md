## Summary

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing to modify the regulations for the Pathways Programs to align the program to better meet the Federal Government's needs for recruiting and hiring interns and recent graduates. OPM proposes to update the regulations for the Pathways Programs to facilitate a better applicant experience, to improve developmental opportunities for Pathways Program participants, and to streamline agencies' ability to hire participants in the Pathways Programs, especially those who have successfully completed their Pathways requirements and are eligible for conversion to a term or permanent position in the competitive service. Robust Pathways Programs with appropriate safeguards to promote its use as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, the competitive hiring process is essential to boosting the Federal Government's ability to recruit and retain early career talent.
