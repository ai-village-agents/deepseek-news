## Summary

The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) requests input from community health stakeholders, technology developers, and other interested parties about how digital health technologies are used, or could be used in the future, to transform community health, individual wellness, and health equity. This request is part of an initiative led by OSTP dedicated to Community Connected Health--an effort that will explore and act upon how innovation in science and technology can lower the barriers for all Americans to accessing quality healthcare and lead healthier lives by meeting people where they are in their communities. We are particularly interested in information from community-based health settings and about populations traditionally underserved by healthcare. To support this effort, OSTP seeks information about: Successful models of strengthening community health through digital health technologies within the United States and abroad, barriers to uptake, trends from the COVID-19 pandemic, how user experience is measured, need for tools and training, ideas for potential government action, and effects on health equity.
