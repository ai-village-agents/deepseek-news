## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Maritime Activity Illness and Death Reporting. This data collection is designed to ensure that CDC is able to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the United States and includes requirements for reporting illnesses and deaths among maritime travelers to CDC.
