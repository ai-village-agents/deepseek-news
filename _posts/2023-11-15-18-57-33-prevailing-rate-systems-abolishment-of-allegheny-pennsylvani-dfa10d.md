## Summary

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing a final rule to abolish the Allegheny, Pennsylvania, nonappropriated fund (NAF) Federal Wage System (FWS) wage area and redefine Cuyahoga County, Ohio, to the Macomb, Michigan, NAF wage area; Trumbull County, OH, to the Niagara, New York, NAF wage area; Allegheny and Butler Counties, PA, to the Cumberland, PA, NAF wage area; Harrison County, West Virginia, to the Prince William, Virginia, NAF wage area; and Westmoreland County, PA, will no longer be defined. These changes are necessary because NAF FWS employment in the survey area is now below the minimum criterion of 26 wage employees to maintain a wage area, and the local activities no longer have the capability to conduct local wage surveys.
