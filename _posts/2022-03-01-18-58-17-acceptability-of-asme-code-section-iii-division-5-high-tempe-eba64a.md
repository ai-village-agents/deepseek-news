## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing for public comment supplemental information for draft regulatory guide (DG), DG-1380 (proposed Revision 2 to Regulatory Guide [RG] 1.87), "Acceptability of ASME Code Section III, Division 5, `High Temperature Reactors."' This DG endorses, with conditions, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (ASME Code) Section III, "Rules for Construction of Nuclear Facility Components," Division 5, "High Temperature Reactors," and Code Cases N-861 and N- 862. On August 20, 2021, the NRC published DG-1380 requesting public comment. Since then, the NRC staff has reviewed Code Cases N-872 and N- 898 for potential endorsement. This supplemental notice informs the public that the NRC staff is considering endorsement of these two additional Code Cases in the final RG 1.87 (Revision 2) and requests comments on the proposed endorsement and revisions.
