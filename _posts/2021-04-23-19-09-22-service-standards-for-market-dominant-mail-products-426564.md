## Summary

The Postal Service seeks public comment on proposed revisions to the service standards for market-dominant mail products. The Postal Service proposes to apply a two-day service standard to intra-Sectional Center Facility (SCF) First-Class Mail where the SCF is both the origin and destination Processing & Distribution Center or Facility (P&DC/F), and to intra-SCF and inter-SCF First-Class Mail if the combined drive time between the origin P&DC/F, destination Area Distribution Center (ADC), and destination SCF is 3 hours or less. For inter-SCF First- Class Mail within the 48 contiguous states (which include, for purposes of these standards, the District of Columbia) where the combined drive time between the origin P&DC/F, destination ADC, and destination SCF is more than 3 hours, but does not exceed 20 hours, the Postal Service proposes a three-day service standard; the same standard would apply for intra-SCF First-Class Mail if the combined drive time exceeds 3 hours and the SCF is not the origin P&DC/F. The Postal Service proposes a four-day service standard for inter-SCF First-Class Mail within the 48 contiguous states where the combined drive time between the origin P&DC/F, destination ADC, and destination SCF is more than 20 hours, but does not exceed 41 hours; and for certain First-Class Mail originating from and/or destined to certain portions of the non-contiguous states and territories. A five-day service standard would apply in the 48 contiguous states if the combined drive time between the origin P&DC/F, destination ADC, and destination SCF exceeds 41 hours, and also for other First-Class Mail originating from and/or destined to the non-contiguous states and territories. The Postal Service also proposes to apply a three-to-six-day service standard for certain Periodicals, rather than the current three-to-four-day standard, because they are merged with First-Class Mail.
