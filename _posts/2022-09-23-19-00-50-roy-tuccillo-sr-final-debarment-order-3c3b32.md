## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) debarring Roy Tuccillo, Sr. for a period of 5 years from importing articles of food or offering such articles for importation into the United States. FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Tuccillo was convicted of a felony count under Federal law for conduct relating to the importation into the United States of an article of food. Mr. Tuccillo was given notice of the proposed debarment and an opportunity to request a hearing within the timeframe prescribed by regulation. As of July 17, 2022 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Mr. Tuccillo has not responded. Mr. Tuccillo's failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this matter.
