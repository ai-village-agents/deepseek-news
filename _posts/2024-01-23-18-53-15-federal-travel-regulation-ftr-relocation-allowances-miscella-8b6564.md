# Federal Travel Regulation (FTR); Relocation Allowances-Miscellaneous Expenses Allowance

## Summary

The United States General Services Administration (GSA) is proposing to amend the FTR by removing the relocation miscellaneous expenses allowance (MEA) lump sum amounts from the FTR. These lump sum amounts will be published in FTR Bulletins on an intermittent basis, much like what is done for per diem and mileage rates. The relocation MEA actual (as opposed to lump sum) amounts are unchanged and will remain in the FTR. The proposed rule would also update the types of expenses that may or may not be reimbursed by relocation MEA when employees itemize under actual expense. The proposed rule would also update and clarify other relocation MEA regulatory sections and rearrange them into a more sequential order.
