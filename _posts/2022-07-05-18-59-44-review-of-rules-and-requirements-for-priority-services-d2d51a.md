## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) adopts changes to its priority services rules to reflect today's marketplace and governance framework and to explicitly authorize the prioritization of IP-based technologies. Specifically, it removes outdated language that may cause confusion or otherwise impede the use of IP-based technologies to support the provision of priority services for voice, data, and video communications. The Commission also amends the rules to reflect the current framework for administration of priority services by the Department of Homeland Security while eliminating burdensome and unnecessary requirements on service providers.
