## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce receipt of the priority lists of wildlife and sport fish conservation projects from the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (Association) for Federal fiscal years (FYs) 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. The Association is required by law to annually submit a list of priority projects to the Service for funding consideration under the Service's Multistate Conservation Grant Program (MSCGP), which funds projects that address regional or national priorities of State fish and wildlife agencies. The Assistant Director for the Service's Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration program recommends projects on the list to the Service Director for approval. Once projects are awarded, we must publish each priority list in the Federal Register. The FY 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 projects have been awarded.
