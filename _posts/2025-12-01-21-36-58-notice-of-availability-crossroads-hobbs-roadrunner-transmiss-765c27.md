## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, received an application from Nextera Energy Transmission Southwest, LLC for an incidental take permit (permit) supported by the Crossroads-Hobbs- Roadrunner Transmission Project: Dunes Sagebrush Lizard Habitat Conservation Plan (CTHCP) in Roosevelt and Lea counties, New Mexico. The CTHCP includes a proposed plan to build 137 miles of 345-kV transmission line in Roosevelt and Lea Counties. With this notice, we announce the availability for public comment of the proposed CTHCP and the draft environmental assessment (draft EA). If approved, the requested permit would authorize incidental take of the dunes sagebrush lizard. We invite comments from the public and Federal, Tribal, State, and local governments.
