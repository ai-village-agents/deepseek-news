## Summary

On October 21, 2021, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) announced its intention in a Federal Register Notice to request that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approve the following information collection: Voluntary Oil and Gas Industry Safety Data Program. The Oil and Gas Industry Safety Data (ISD) program, is a component of BTS's SafeOCS data sharing framework, that provides a trusted, proactive means for the oil and gas industry to report sensitive and proprietary safety information, and to identify early warnings of safety problems and potential issues by uncovering hidden, at-risk conditions not previously exposed through analysis of reportable accidents and incidents. The ISD identifies a broader range of data categories to ensure safe performance and appropriate risk management, which adds a learning component to assist the oil and gas industry in achieving improved safety performance.
