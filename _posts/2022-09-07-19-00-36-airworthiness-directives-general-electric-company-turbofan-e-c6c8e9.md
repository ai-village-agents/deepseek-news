## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain General Electric Company (GE) GEnx-1B model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by several reports of fuel leaks caused by high cycle fatigue (HCF) cracks found at the braze joints on fuel manifolds, and the subsequent manufacturer redesign of the high-pressure turbine (HPT) fuel hose variable stator vane (VSV) manifold, VSV fuel hose manifold, low-pressure turbine (LPT) fuel hose variable bleed valve (VBV) manifold, and VBV fuel hose manifold. This AD requires removal and replacement of the fuel hydraulic lines. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
