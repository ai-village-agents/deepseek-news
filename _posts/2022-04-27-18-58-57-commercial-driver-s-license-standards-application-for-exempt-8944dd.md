## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to grant an exemption from the commercial driver's license (CDL) requirements to Daimler Trucks North America (Daimler) for one of its commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers, Ms. Gesa Reimelt, a product engineer in powertrain solutions. She holds a valid German commercial license and wants to test drive Daimler vehicles on U.S. roads to better understand product requirements in "real world" environments and verify results. Under this exemption, Ms. Reimelt is exempt from the the Agency's drug and alcohol regulations in 49 CFR part 382, which apply only to CDL holders. FMCSA reviewed Ms. Reimelt's commercial license records provided by Daimler, and believes the requirements for a German commercial license, the work restrictions imposed on Daimler drivers because of nonimmigrant visa requirements, and the terms and conditions set forth below, including a Daimler-administered drug and alcohol testing program, will ensure that her operation under this exemption will likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to or greater than the level that would be obtained in the absence of the exemption.
