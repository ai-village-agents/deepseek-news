## Summary

The Rural Utilities Services (RUS or the Agency), an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), announces its Technical Assistance and Construction for Innovative Regional Wastewater Treatment Solutions (TAC-RWTS) Grant Pilot Program application window for Fiscal Year (FY) 2023. Grants may be made to eligible entities for the study, design, or construction of regional wastewater systems for historically impoverished communities in areas that have had difficulty installing traditional wastewater treatment systems due to soil conditions.

Successful applications will be selected by the Agency for funding and subsequently awarded from available funds for the TAC-RWTS Grant Pilot Program. All applicants are responsible for any expenses incurred in developing their applications.
