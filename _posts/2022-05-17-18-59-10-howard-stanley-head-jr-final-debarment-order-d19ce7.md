## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) debarring Howard Stanley Head, Jr. for a period of 5 years from importing or offering for import any drug into the United States. FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Head was convicted of one felony count under Federal law for conspiracy to import misbranded prescription drugs. The factual basis supporting Mr. Head's conviction, as described below, is conduct relating to the importation into the United States of a drug or controlled substance. Mr. Head was given notice of the proposed debarment and was given an opportunity to request a hearing to show why he should not be debarred. As of March 24, 2022 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Mr. Head had not responded. Mr. Head's failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this matter.
