## Summary

Section 106 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) made ASTM F963-07[egr]1, Standard Consumer Safety Specification for Toy Safety, a mandatory consumer product safety standard. Section 106 also provides procedures for revisions to the ASTM F963 standard. In accordance with those procedures, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) has allowed the revised standard, ASTM F963-23, to become the mandatory toy standard. This direct final rule incorporates by reference ASTM F963-23 and updates the existing notice of requirements (NOR) that provide the criteria and processes for Commission acceptance of accreditation of third-party conformity assessment bodies for testing to ASTM F963.
