## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve the regional haze state implementation plan revision submitted by Oregon on April 29, 2022, as supplemented on November 22, 2023, as satisfying applicable requirements under the Clean Air Act and the EPA's Regional Haze Rule for the program's second implementation period. The Oregon submission addressed the requirement that states must periodically revise their long-term strategies for making reasonable progress towards the national goal of preventing any future, and remedying any existing, anthropogenic impairment of visibility, including regional haze, in mandatory Class I Federal areas. The Oregon submission also addressed other applicable requirements for the second implementation period of the regional haze program. Upon final action, the Oregon submission will become part of the Oregon SIP.
