## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A330-200 series; A330-200 Freighter series; A330-300 series; A330-800 series; A330-900 series; A340-200 series; and A340-300 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of cracks found in the scroll housing assembly of Honeywell GTCP331-350 auxiliary power units (APUs). This proposed AD would require replacing each affected APU or re-identifying certain APU scroll housing assemblies, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
