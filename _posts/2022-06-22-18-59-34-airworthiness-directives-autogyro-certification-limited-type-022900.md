## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all AutoGyro Certification Limited (type certificate previously held by RotorSport UK Ltd) Model Calidus, Cavalon, and MTOsport 2017 gyroplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of rotor blade longitudinal cracking and rotor blade attachment bolt hole fretting corrosion and cracking. This AD requires reducing the life limits for the rotor systems, repetitively inspecting each rotor blade, and depending on the outcome, removing parts from service. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
