## Summary

The FAA is adding a new load condition to the design standards for transport category airplanes. The new load condition requires such airplanes to be designed to withstand the loads caused by rapid reversals of the rudder pedals, and applies to transport category airplanes that have a powered rudder control surface or surfaces. This rule is necessary because accident and incident data show that pilots sometimes make rudder reversals during flight, even though such reversals are unnecessary and discouraged by flightcrew training programs. The current design standards do not require the airplane structure to withstand the loads that may result from such reversals. If the loads on the airplane exceed those for which it is designed, the airplane structure may fail, resulting in catastrophic loss of control of the airplane. This final rule aims to prevent structural failure of the rudder and vertical stabilizer that may result from these rudder reversals.
