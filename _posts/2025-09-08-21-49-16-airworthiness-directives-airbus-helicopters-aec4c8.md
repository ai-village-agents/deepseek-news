## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model H160-B helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would require revising the existing maintenance manual or instructions for continued airworthiness and the existing approved maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, by incorporating new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
