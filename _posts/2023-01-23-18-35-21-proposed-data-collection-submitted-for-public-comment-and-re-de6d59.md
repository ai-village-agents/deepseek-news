## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Message Testing for Tobacco Communication Activities (MTTCA). The primary purpose and use of information collected under MTTCA is to inform the development and pretesting of materials for the CDC's ongoing National Tobacco Education Campaign (NTEC), and other health messages that are not specifically associated with the NTEC (e.g., Surgeon General's Reports).
