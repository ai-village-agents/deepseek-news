## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Florida, through the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), on January 23, 2020. The SIP revision seeks to update the attainment emissions inventory and the maintenance demonstration, including the projected future emissions inventories, in the maintenance plan for the Hillsborough County lead maintenance area (hereinafter referred to as the "Hillsborough Area" or "Area") for the 2008 lead national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). The SIP revision also seeks to incorporate recent changes to the air construction permit for the EnviroFocus Technologies, LLC (EnviroFocus) facility in the Area that are related to an increase in the refined lead production limit. EPA proposes to find that this SIP revision meets all relevant Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) statutory and regulatory requirements, is consistent with EPA's guidance, and is in accordance with EPA's September 11, 2018, redesignation of the Hillsborough Area from nonattainment to maintenance.
