## Summary

We are adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Fokker Services B.V. Model F28 Mark 0070 and 0100 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of fuselage bottom skin exfoliation corrosion, fuselage skin bulging and cracking, and missing fastener heads. This AD requires a detailed inspection of the fuselage bottom skin for corrosion; skin cracks or bulges; and missing, loose, or broken fasteners; and, depending on the findings, accomplishment of applicable repairs; as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. We are issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
