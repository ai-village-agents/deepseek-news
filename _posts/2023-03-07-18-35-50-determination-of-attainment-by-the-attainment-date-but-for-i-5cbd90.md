## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or "Agency") is proposing to determine that the El Paso-Las Cruces, Texas-New Mexico nonattainment area would have attained the 2015 ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) by the August 3, 2021 "Marginal" area attainment date, but for emissions emanating from outside the United States. If we finalize this action as proposed, the El Paso-Las Cruces, Texas-New Mexico ozone nonattainment area would no longer be subject to the Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements pertaining to reclassification upon failure to attain and therefore would remain classified as a Marginal nonattainment area for the 2015 ozone NAAQS. This action, if finalized as proposed, will discharge the EPA's statutory obligation to determine whether the El Paso-Las Cruces, Texas-New Mexico ozone nonattainment area attained the NAAQS by the attainment date.
