## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") proposes to amend the test procedures for dedicated-purpose pool pumps ("DPPPs") to incorporate by reference the latest version of the relevant industry standards, to codify DOE's current enforcement policy regarding the scope of the DPPP test procedure pertaining to DPPPs that cannot be appropriately tested by the current DOE test procedure, to align DOE's DPPP definitions with DOE's corresponding DPPP motor definitions, and to remove an obsolete DOE DPPP test procedure appendix. DOE is seeking comment from interested parties on the proposal.
