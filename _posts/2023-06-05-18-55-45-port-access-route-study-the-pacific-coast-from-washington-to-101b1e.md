## Summary

The Coast Guard announces the availability of the study results of the Pacific Coast Port Access Route Study. This study evaluated safe access routes for the movement of vessel traffic proceeding to or from ports or places along the western seaboard of the United States. As a result of the study data and public input, the Coast Guard recommends the establishment of voluntary shipping fairways ("fairway") for coastwise and nearshore vessel traffic to promote the safe, unobstructed navigation of vessels in the study area.
