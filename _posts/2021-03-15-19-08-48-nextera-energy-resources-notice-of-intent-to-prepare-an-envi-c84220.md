## Summary

The Rural Utilities Service (RUS) announces its intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and hold a virtual public scoping meeting in connection with possible impacts related to the Skeleton Creek Solar and Battery Storage Project (Project) proposed by NextEra Energy Resources (NextEra or Applicant). The Project will consist of a 250-megawatt (MW) solar array, plus 200-MW/800-megawatt- hour (MWh) storage facility using photovoltaic (PV) modules on private lands in Garfield County, Oklahoma. NextEra is seeking federal loan financing from RUS to support construction of the Project. RUS has determined that a loan for the Project would be a federal action and is, therefore, subject to National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review, with RUS as the lead federal agency, for preparation of the EIS.
