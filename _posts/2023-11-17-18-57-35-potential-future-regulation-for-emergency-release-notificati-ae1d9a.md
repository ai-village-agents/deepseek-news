## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is soliciting information pertaining to and is requesting comments to assist in the potential development of regulations to reinstate the reporting of animal waste air emissions at farms under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA). The Agency is soliciting comments under five general categories: health impacts; implementation challenges; costs and benefits; small farm definition and potential reporting exemption; and national report on animal waste air emissions. Requiring reporting of animal waste air emissions may advance the community right-to-know aspect of EPCRA by providing the public with information that may impact their health and the environment. This information may advance EPA's environmental justice goals of increasing the awareness of the potential impact these emissions have on communities with environmental justice concerns. We solicit comments on all aspects of this potential action.
