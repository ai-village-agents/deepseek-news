## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bell Textron Inc. Model 204B, 205A, and 205A-1 helicopters and various restricted category helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of cracked main rotor blades (MRBs). This AD requires repetitive inspections of each MRB and removing any cracked MRB from service. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
