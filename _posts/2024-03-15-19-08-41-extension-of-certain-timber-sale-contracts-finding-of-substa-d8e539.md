## Summary

The Chief of the Forest Service, Department of Agriculture, has determined that it is in the substantial overriding public interest (SOPI) to redetermine pulpwood rates and extend up to two years certain National Forest System timber sales and sale of property stewardship contracts. This finding applies to timber sale and sale of property stewardship contracts that were awarded before March 13, 2024, and, upon award, to contracts with a bid opening prior to March 13, 2024, subject to specified exceptions. Contracts with 20 percent or more of the included product listed as pulpwood with required removal will qualify for a pulpwood rate redetermination and may qualify for an extension under this SOPI finding. The SOPI determination is due to a combination of factors impacting the national economy and the pulp, paper, and chips markets. The intended effect of pulpwood rate redeterminations and extensions of certain timber and sale of property contracts is to allow timber purchasers and contractors time to navigate through the market conditions; to minimize contract defaults, mill closures, and bankruptcies; to sustain employment opportunities, and to minimize the time-consuming and often difficult process of collecting default damages. Without a vibrant forest products industry, the Forest Service cannot manage the land to meet the multiple forest management and restoration objectives nationwide as intended and funded by Congress.
