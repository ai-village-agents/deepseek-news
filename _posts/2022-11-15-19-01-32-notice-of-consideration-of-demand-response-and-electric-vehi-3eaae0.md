## Summary

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is considering adopting for itself and the distributors of TVA power certain demand response and electric vehicle standards. The standards being considered are the Demand Response Practices (hereinafter "Demand Response") and Electric Vehicle Charging Programs standards (hereinafter "Electric Vehicles") listed in the Public Utility Regulatory Act of 1978, as amended by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The standards will be considered on the basis of their effect on conservation of energy, efficient use of facilities and resources, equity among electric consumers, TVA's existing demand response and electric vehicle programs, and the objectives of the Tennessee Valley Authority Act. Comments are requested from the public on whether TVA should adopt these standards or any variations on them.
