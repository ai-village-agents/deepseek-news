## Summary

NMFS proposes regulations to implement Amendment 50 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Snapper-Grouper Fishery of the South Atlantic (FMP), as prepared and submitted by the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council). For red porgy, this proposed rule would revise the sector annual catch limits (ACLs), commercial seasonal quotas, commercial trip limits, recreational bag and possession limits, recreational fishing season, and recreational accountability measures (AMs). In addition, Amendment 50 would establish a new rebuilding plan, and revise the acceptable biological catch (ABC), annual optimum yield (OY), and sector allocations. The purpose of this proposed rule and Amendment 50 is to end overfishing of red porgy, rebuild the stock, and achieve OY while minimizing, to the extent practicable, adverse social and economic effects.
