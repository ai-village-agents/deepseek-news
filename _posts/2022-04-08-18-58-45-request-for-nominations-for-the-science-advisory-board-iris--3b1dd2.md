## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Science Advisory Board (SAB) Staff Office requests public nominations of scientific experts to form a Panel to review the draft EPA Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) Toxicological Review of Chloroform (Inhalation). The draft cancer and non-cancer assessment includes a hazard identification analysis, which summarizes the available evidence on health effects that may be associated with environmental or occupational exposure, and dose-response analysis, which characterizes the quantitative relationship between chloroform inhalation exposure and each credible health hazard. The SAB Chloroform Review Panel will consider whether the conclusions found in the EPA's draft assessment are clearly presented and scientifically supported. The Panel will also be asked to provide recommendations on how the assessment may be strengthened.
