## Summary

The Commission proposes to update its radiofrequency (RF) device marketing and importation rules in order to allow equipment manufacturers to better gauge consumer interest and prepare for new product launches. In particular, the Commission proposes limited exceptions to its requirement that RF devices receive equipment authorization prior to marketing in or importation to the United States and it seeks comment on the conditions necessary to ensure that parties who utilize such exceptions ultimately bring such devices into full compliance with the Commission's equipment authorization rules.
