## Summary

This rule adds the State of Missouri as a primary peanut- producing State under the Peanut Promotion, Research, and Information Order (Order). The Order is administered by the National Peanut Board (Board) with oversight by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). This rule also adds a producer member and alternate member to the Board to represent the State of Missouri. The Board recommended this action to ensure the Board's representation reflects changes in the geographical distribution of the production of peanuts.
