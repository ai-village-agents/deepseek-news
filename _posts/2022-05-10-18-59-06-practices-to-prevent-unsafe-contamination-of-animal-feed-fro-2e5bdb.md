The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, Agency, or we) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry #272 entitled "Practices to Prevent Unsafe Contamination of Animal Feed from Drug Carryover."

Unsafe contamination of animal feed from drug carryover can pose a risk to human and animal health.
