## Summary

On January 29, 2021, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) published a document in the Federal Register requesting public comment on a regulatory basis to support a proposed rule that would amend the NRC's regulations for the licensing of new nuclear power reactors. The public comment period was originally scheduled to close on April 14, 2021. The NRC has decided to extend the public comment period to allow more time for members of the public to develop and submit their comments.
