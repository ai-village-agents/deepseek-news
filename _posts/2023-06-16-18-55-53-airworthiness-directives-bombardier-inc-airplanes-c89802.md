## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-100-1A10 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that a design deficiency was discovered which could allow a no-back pawl to be incorrectly installed in a horizontal stabilizer trim actuator (HSTA). This AD requires a check for part number and serial numbers of the HSTA, and if necessary, inspection of the no-back pawl installation, and corrective action. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
