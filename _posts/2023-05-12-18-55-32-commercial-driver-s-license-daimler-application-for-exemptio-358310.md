## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to grant an exemption from the commercial driver's license (CDL) requirements to Daimler Truck North America LLC (Daimler) for one commercial motor vehicle (CMV) driver, Dr Andreas Gorbach, Executive Vice President and Board of Management Member for Daimler. Dr. Gorbach holds a valid German commercial license and wants to operate CMVs in interstate or intrastate commerce to support Daimler field tests designed to meet future vehicle safety and environmental requirements. FMCSA reviewed Dr. Gorbach's commercial license records provided by Daimler and believes the requirements for a German commercial license will ensure that Dr. Gorbach's operation of a CMV under this exemption will likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to or greater than the level that would be obtained in the absence of the exemption.
