## Summary

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) recently sought public comments on topics related to the study of the patent pro bono programs identified in the Unleashing American Innovators Act of 2022. This study builds on the work the USPTO has conducted for over a decade, and has scaled during the Biden Administration, to bring more people in America into the innovation ecosystem. The USPTO believes that broadening access to the intellectual property system will create more jobs, foster economic prosperity, and promote the development of solutions for societal challenges. In response to stakeholder feedback, the USPTO is extending the comment period until August 11, 2023, to give interested members of the public additional time to submit comments.
