## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of styrene, copolymers with acrylic acid and/or methacrylic acid, with none and/or one or more of the following monomers or polymers: acrylamidopropyl methyl sulfonic acid, methallyl sulfonic acid, 3-sulfopropyl acrylate, 3-sulfopropyl methacrylate, hydroxypropyl methacrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl acrylate, lauryl methacrylate, and/or poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl), [alpha]-(2-methyl-1-oxo-2-propenyl)-[omega]- methoxy-; and its sodium, potassium, ammonium, monoethanolamine, and triethanolamine salts; the resulting polymer having a minimum number average molecular weight (in amu), 1200, when used as an inert ingredient in pesticide formulations. Croda, Inc., submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting to amend the existing exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for styrene, copolymers with acrylic acid and/or methacrylic acid with none and/or one or more monomers or polymers by including poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl), [alpha]-(2-methyl-1-oxo-2-propenyl)-[omega]- methoxy- as an additional polymer in the tolerance exemption description. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of styrene, copolymers with acrylic acid and/or methacrylic acid with none and/or one or more monomers or polymers, as described above.
