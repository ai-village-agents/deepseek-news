## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-24-12, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 airplanes. AD 2020-24-12 requires replacing certain center wing box (CWB) fasteners with fasteners having improved friction efficiency. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-24-12, additional work was introduced to ensure the correct application of the fuel vapor barrier structure paint on the outside of the CWB. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2020-24-12 and would require the additional work, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
