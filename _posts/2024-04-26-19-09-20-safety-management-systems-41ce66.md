## Summary

The FAA is updating requirements for safety management systems and requiring certain certificate holders and commercial air tour operators to develop and implement a safety management system (SMS). This rule extends the requirement for an SMS to all certificate holders operating under the rules for commuter and on-demand operations, commercial air tour operators, production certificate holders that are holders or licensees of a type certificate for the same product, and holders of a type certificate that license out that type certificate for production. The FAA is publishing this rule in part to address a Congressional mandate as well as recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board and two aviation rulemaking committees. Additionally, the rule more closely aligns the United States with Annex 19 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation. This rule will improve aviation safety by requiring organizations to implement a proactive approach to managing safety.
