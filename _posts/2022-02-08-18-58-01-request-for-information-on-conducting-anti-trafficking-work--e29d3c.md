## Summary

The Department of State, on behalf of the Senior Policy Operating Group (SPOG) (see Background section below for more information on the SPOG), requests written information on how it can advance racial justice and equity to assist in SPOG agencies' individual and the SPOG's collective implementation of Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government. This request for information (RFI) is part of the SPOG's ongoing efforts to engage and collaborate with diverse communities and develop an implementation plan for integrating racial equity into U.S. government anti-trafficking efforts. The implementation plan will also highlight the importance of an intersectional approach, as racism often compounds with other forms of discrimination to affect individuals' vulnerability to human trafficking. Additionally, it will complement agencies' individual work to implement Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce by sharing information and practices for increasing diversity in the federal workforce as an integral way to strengthen agencies' anti-trafficking work. Submissions must be made in writing to the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons at the Department of State by March 15, 2022. Please refer to the Addresses, Scope of Interest, and Information Sought sections of this Notice for additional instructions on submission requirements.
