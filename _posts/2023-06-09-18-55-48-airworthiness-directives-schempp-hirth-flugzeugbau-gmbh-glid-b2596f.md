## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Schempp-Hirth Flugzeugbau GmbH (Schempp-Hirth) Model Ventus-2a and Ventus-2b gliders. This proposed AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as the uncommanded extraction of the airbrakes on one or both wings, possibly resulting in reduced control of the glider. This proposed AD would require repetitively inspecting airbrake bell cranks and airbrake drive funnels for cracking, repetitively inspecting the clearance of the airbrake control system, and taking corrective action as necessary. This proposed AD would also require modifying the airbrake system, which is terminating action for the repetitive inspections. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
