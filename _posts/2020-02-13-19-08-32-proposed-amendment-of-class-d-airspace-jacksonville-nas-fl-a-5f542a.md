## Summary

This action proposes to amend Class D airspace for Jacksonville NAS, FL, by updating the name and geographical coordinates of Jacksonville NAS, (Towers Field, previously Jacksonville NAS), and Herlong Recreational Airport (previously Herlong Airport). This action would also amend Class D airspace and Class E airspace designated as an extension to Class D or E surface area by updating geographic coordinates of Mayport NAS, and the name and geographic coordinates of Jacksonville Executive Airport at Craig, (previously Craig Municipal Airport). Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area. This action also would make an editorial change replacing the term Airport/Facility Directory with the term Chart Supplement in the legal descriptions of associated Class D and E airspace.
