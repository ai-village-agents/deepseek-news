## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled "Data Integrity for In Vivo Bioavailability and Bioequivalence Studies." The purpose of this guidance is to provide recommendations to applicants and testing site management on achieving and maintaining data integrity for the clinical and bioanalytical portions of bioavailability (BA) and bioequivalence (BE) studies submitted in support of investigational new drug applications (INDs), new drug applications (NDAs), abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), and the bioanalytical portion of clinical pharmacologic studies supporting Center for Drug Evaluation and Research-regulated biologic license applications (BLAs) as well as amendments and supplements to these applications. In addition, the recommendations in this guidance apply to the bioanalytical portion of nonclinical studies. FDA also encourages applicants and testing sites to consider these recommendations when conducting other studies, including in vitro and pharmacology and toxicology studies.
