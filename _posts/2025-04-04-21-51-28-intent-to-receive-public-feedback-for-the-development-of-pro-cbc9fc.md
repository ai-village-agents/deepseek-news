## Summary

We announce our intention to host public hearings and establish one or more negotiated rulemaking committees to prepare proposed regulations on various programs authorized under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA) (title IV, HEA programs). The Department invites public feedback, especially addressing topics which may include Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), Pay As You Earn (PAYE), Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR), or other topics that would streamline current federal student financial assistance programs.
