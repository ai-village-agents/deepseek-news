## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-16-11, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A300 F4-600R series airplanes. AD 2019-16-11 requires repetitive high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections of the aft lower deck cargo door (LDCD) frame forks; a one-time check of the LDCD clearances; a one-time detailed visual inspection of hooks, eccentric bushes, and x-stops; and corrective actions if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2019-16-11, it has been determined that the threshold for the (repetitive) HFEC inspection needs to be corrected, and the LDCD frame forks modified. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2019-16-11 and would require correcting the HFEC inspection threshold and modifying the LDCD frame forks and prohibit the installation of affected LDCDs under certain conditions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
