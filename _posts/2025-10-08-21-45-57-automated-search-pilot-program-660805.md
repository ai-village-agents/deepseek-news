## Summary

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is implementing the Automated Search Pilot Program to evaluate the impact of sharing the results of an automated search prior to examination of an original, noncontinuing, nonprovisional utility patent application. Conducting an automated search and sending an Automated Search Results Notice (ASRN) to the applicant will provide the applicant with an earlier communication regarding potential prior art issues in their application. To participate in this new pilot procedure, the applicant must file a petition accompanied by a petition fee. With this pilot program, the USPTO aims to ascertain the impact of sharing a pre- examination search report on prosecution by applicants, evaluate the scalability of generating ASRNs, and collect data to inform next steps. This notice is to inform applicants of the pilot program and to provide them with important details regarding the program, including how to participate.
