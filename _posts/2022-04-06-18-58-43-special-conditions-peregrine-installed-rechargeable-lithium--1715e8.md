## Summary

These special conditions are issued for a supplemental type certificate to install rechargeable lithium batteries in an electronic standby instrument on certain transport category airplanes. These airplanes, as modified by Peregrine, will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport category airplanes. This design feature is the installation of an electronic standby instrument supply that contains rechargeable lithium batteries. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
