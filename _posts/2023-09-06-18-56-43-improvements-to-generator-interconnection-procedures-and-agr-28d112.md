## Summary

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission or FERC) is adopting reforms to its pro forma Large Generator Interconnection Procedures, pro forma Small Generator Interconnection Procedures, pro forma Large Generator Interconnection Agreement, and pro forma Small Generator Interconnection Agreement to address interconnection queue backlogs, improve certainty, and prevent undue discrimination for new technologies. The reforms are intended to ensure that the generator interconnection process is just, reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.
