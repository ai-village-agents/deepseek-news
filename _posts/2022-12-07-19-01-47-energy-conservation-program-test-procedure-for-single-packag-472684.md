## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is publishing a final rule to amend its test procedures for single package vertical air conditioners and single package vertical heat pumps, collectively referred to as single package vertical units ("SPVUs"). DOE is incorporating by reference the most recent version of the relevant industry test standard, AHRI 390-2021, and amending certain provisions for representations for SPVUs. DOE is also establishing definitions for "single-phase single package vertical air conditioners with cooling capacity less than 65,000 Btu/h" and for "single-phase single package vertical heat pumps with cooling capacity less than 65,000 Btu/h" to distinguish such equipment from certain residential central air conditioners and heat pumps.
