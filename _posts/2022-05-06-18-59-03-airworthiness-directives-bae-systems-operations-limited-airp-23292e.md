## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2015-07-05, which applies to all BAE Systems (Operations) Limited Model BAe 146 series airplanes and Model Avro 146-RJ series airplanes. AD 2015-07-05 requires repetitive external eddy current inspections on the aft skin lap joints of the rear fuselage for cracking, corrosion, and other defects, and repair if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2015- 07-05, an inspection has been added and certain compliance times must be revised to address the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2015-07-05, at certain revised compliance times, and also require repetitive low frequency eddy current (LFEC) inspections for any cracking, corrosion, and other defects in the aft skin lap joints of the rear fuselage and in the fuselage skin panels, and repair if necessary. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
