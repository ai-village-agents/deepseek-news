## Summary

The Corporation for National and Community Service (operating as AmeriCorps) is revising regulations governing the number of terms for which AmeriCorps will fund living allowances and other benefits for AmeriCorps State and National members. Specifically, this rule increases the flexibility of the current rule by providing that AmeriCorps funding may be used for living allowances and other benefits for members for as long as it takes the members to either earn the aggregate value of two full-time Segal Education Awards or four terms, whichever is longer.
