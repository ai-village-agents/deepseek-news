# Radio Broadcasting Services; Various Locations

## Summary

This document amends the FM Table of Allotments, of the Federal Communications Commission's (Commission) rules, by designating as unreserved the FM allotment channels that are reserved for noncommercial educational ("NCE") use in various communities. The FM allotments are vacant as a result of the dismissal of an application or cancellation of the authorization or license. We classify as unreserved these NCE channels that are in the commercial band (Channels 221 to 300) by operation of law. These FM allotment channels have previously undergone notice and comment rulemaking. This action constitutes an editorial change in the FM Table of Allotments. Therefore, we find for good cause that further notice and comment are unnecessary.
