## Summary

This action amends five VHF Omnidirectional Radar (VOR) Federal airways, V-18, V-222, V-245, V-325, and V-417 in association with the VOR Minimum Operation Network (MON) project in the southeastern United States. This action is necessary due to the planned decommissioning of the following ground-based NAVAIDs: Atlanta, GA, (ATL) VOR Tactical Air Navigational System (VORTAC); Crimson, AL, (LDK) VORTAC; and Macon, GA, (MCN) VORTAC. The following airways are removed from this docket and will be addressed in a subsequent docket action at a later date: V-115, V-241, V-311, V-321, V-333, V-415, and V-463.
