## Summary

In this Notice of Inquiry, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission seeks comment on whether to revise its regulations that require a Regional Transmission Organization or Independent System Operator not to accept bids from an aggregator of retail customers that aggregates the demand response of the customers of utilities that distributed more than 4 million megawatt-hours in the previous fiscal year, where the relevant electric retail regulatory authority prohibits such customers' demand response to be bid into organized markets by an aggregator of retail customers.
