## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is requesting comment on guidance on petitions for a No Migration Variance (NMV) under the Land Disposal Restrictions (LDRs) pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Under existing regulations, persons may apply for an NMV to allow for the land placement (e.g., landfill, impoundment, waste pile) of hazardous waste that, if approved, would allow for the placement of hazardous waste in such a unit where the waste does not meet applicable LDR treatment standards. This guidance provides information to persons applying for an NMV for a waste pile temporarily located within a RCRA-permitted landfill cell.
