## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are reopening the comment period on our May 21, 2025, proposed rule to list the Fish Lake Valley tui chub (Siphateles obesus ssp.), a fish found in Esmeralda County in southwestern Nevada, as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). We are taking this action to conduct a public hearing and to allow all interested parties an additional opportunity to comment on the proposed rule. Comments previously submitted on the proposed rule need not be resubmitted and will be fully considered in our development of the final rule.
