## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is correcting a document that appeared in the Federal Register (FR) on August 15, 2025. The EPA finalized the document announcing three public hearings and comment period extensions for the following rules: Extension of Deadlines: Standards of Performance for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources and Emissions Guidelines for Existing Sources: Oil and Natural Gas Sector Climate Review Interim Final Rule; National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Integrated Iron and Steel Manufacturing Facilities; National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Coke Ovens: Pushing, Quenching, and Battery Stacks, and Coke Oven Batteries. Following publication of this document, the EPA discovered inadvertent errors in the comment period extension dates for the Oil and Natural Gas and Iron and Steel rulemakings and is correcting them in this action.
