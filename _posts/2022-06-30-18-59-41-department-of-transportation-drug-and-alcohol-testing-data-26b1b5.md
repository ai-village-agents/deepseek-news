## Summary

In March 2021, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) published a report titled "DOT Has Taken Steps to Verify and Publicize Drug and Alcohol Testing Data but Should Do More." The report examines how the Department of Transportation (DOT) uses drug and alcohol testing data, how DOT verifies that data are reliable, and whether DOT follows key actions for transparently reporting drug and alcohol testing data. The drug and alcohol testing data are primarily used by the DOT modal administrations and the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to determine the random testing rate(s) for safety-sensitive employees in each industry each year. In response to a recommendation from the GAO Report, DOT requests information from potential users in the public to determine if there is a broader audience for the public data, consistent with key actions for open government data.
