## Summary

We, NMFS, announce a 90-day finding on a petition to list the great hammerhead shark (Sphyrna mokarran) as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and to designate critical habitat. We find that the petition does not present substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted.
