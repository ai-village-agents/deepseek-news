## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA or Agency) is amending various regulations governing SBA's Disaster Loan Program in order to expand options for disaster loan recipients as well as reflect the impact of inflationary increases over time that result in higher costs. These changes, including the increase to the home loan lending limits, the extension of the deferment period and the expansion of mitigation options, are intended to increase disaster survivors' access to obtain needed disaster loan funds for the repair or replacement of a damaged property. The changes are overdue and necessary due to increased costs related to construction and labor, as well as increases in property valuations that have occurred over time.
