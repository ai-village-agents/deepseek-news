## Summary

In this final rule, NMFS prohibits the use of wire leaders in the Hawaii deep-set longline fishery, and requires the removal of fishing gear from any oceanic whitetip shark caught in all of the region's domestic longline fisheries. The rule is intended to increase post-hooking survival of threatened oceanic whitetip sharks.
