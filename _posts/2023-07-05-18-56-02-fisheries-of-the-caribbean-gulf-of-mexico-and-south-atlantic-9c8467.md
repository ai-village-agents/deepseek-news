## Summary

NMFS implements an accountability measure for recreational greater amberjack in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) reef fish fishery for the 2023-2024 fishing year through this temporary rule. NMFS has determined that Gulf greater amberjack landings are projected to reach the recreational annual catch target (ACT) for the 2023-2024 fishing year by August 25, 2023. Therefore, the recreational fishing season for greater amberjack in the Gulf exclusive economic zone (EEZ) will close on August 25, 2023, and the sector will remain closed until the start of the next recreational fishing season on August 1, 2024. This closure is necessary to protect the Gulf greater amberjack resource.
