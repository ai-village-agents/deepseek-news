## Summary

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is issuing this finding of no significant impact and accompanying environmental assessment regarding the CFPB's consideration of a proposed rule to implement a Congressional mandate to establish consumer protections for residential Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing. Based on the environmental assessment, the CFPB has concluded that there will be no significant effects on the human environment from the proposed PACE rule, and therefore, a finding of no significant impact is appropriate.
