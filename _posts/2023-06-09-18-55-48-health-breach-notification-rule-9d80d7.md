## Summary

The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC" or "Commission") proposes to amend the Commission's Health Breach Notification Rule (the "HBN Rule" or the "Rule") and requests public comment on the proposed changes. The HBN Rule requires vendors of personal health records ("PHRs") and related entities that are not covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA") to notify individuals, the FTC, and, in some cases, the media of a breach of unsecured personally identifiable health data.
