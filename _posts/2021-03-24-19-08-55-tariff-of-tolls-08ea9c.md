## Summary

The Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (GLS) and the St. Lawrence Seaway Management Corporation (SLSMC) of Canada, under international agreement, jointly publish and presently administer the St. Lawrence Seaway Tariff of Tolls in their respective jurisdictions. The Tariff sets forth the level of tolls assessed on all commodities and vessels transiting the facilities operated by the GLS and the SLSMC. The GLS is revising its regulations to reflect the fees and charges levied by the SLSMC in Canada starting in the 2021 navigation season, which are effective only in Canada. An amendment to increase the minimum charge per lock for those vessels that are not pleasure craft or subject in Canada to tolls under items 1 and 2 of the Tariff for full or partial transit of the Seaway will apply in the U.S. (See SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION.) In addition, Congress renamed the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (SLSDC) as Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (GLS) as part of the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act, signed into law on December 27, 2020. The joint regulations are being amended to reflect the name change. The Tariff of Tolls are in effect in Canada.
