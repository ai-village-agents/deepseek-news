## Summary

This action amends VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airway V-7 in the vicinity of Sheboygan, WI. The modifications are necessary due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Falls, WI, VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) navigation aid (NAVAID), which provides navigation guidance for portions of the affected air traffic service (ATS) route. The Falls VOR is being decommissioned as part of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
