## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-25- 51, which applied to all Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD- 500-1A10 and Model BD-500-1A11 airplanes. AD 2022-25-51 required revising the Limitations section of the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to include a new warning and a new limitation. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-25-51, updated primary flight control computer (PFCC) software has been developed to address the unsafe condition. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2022-25-51, requires installing the updated PFCC software, which terminates the AFM revision, and removes airplanes from the applicability. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
