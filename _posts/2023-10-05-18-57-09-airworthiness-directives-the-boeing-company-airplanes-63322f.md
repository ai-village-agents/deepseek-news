## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 767 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of cracks on the forward entry door and forward service door cutout aft lower corner fuselage skin and bear strap. This proposed AD would require repetitive inspections for cracking at the affected area, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
