U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Eric Miller from Bravo Battery, 1st Battalion, 14th Field Artillery Regiment, 75th Field Artillery Brigade, assigned to Task Force Pergalė, conducts an interview about the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System with local Lithuanian media prior to executing a live-fire exercise alongside Lithuanian partners, Feb. 3, 2026 in Klaipėda, Lithuania. The exercise marks the culminating event of the HIMARS apprenticeship program, during which the U.S. Soldiers trained Lithuanian forces in the operation, maintenance, and sustainment of the HIMARS. The event underscores Lithuanian’s investment in defense modernization, demonstrating how advanced capabilities provide credible deterrence and strengthen the Eastern Flank Deterrence Line.
