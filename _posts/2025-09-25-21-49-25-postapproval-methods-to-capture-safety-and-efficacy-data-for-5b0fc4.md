## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, Agency, or we) is announcing the availability of a draft document entitled "Postapproval Methods to Capture Safety and Efficacy Data for Cell and Gene Therapy Products; Draft Guidance for Industry." The draft guidance document discusses methods and approaches for capturing postapproval safety and efficacy data for cell and gene therapy (CGT) products. Given the potential for long-lasting effects of CGT products, and the generally limited number of participants treated in clinical trials, the collection of postapproval study data for CGT products is important for gathering data on product safety and effectiveness over time.
