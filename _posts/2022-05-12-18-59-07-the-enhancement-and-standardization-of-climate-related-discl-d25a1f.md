## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") is extending the comment period for a release proposing amendments to its rules under the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") that would require registrants to provide certain climate-related information in their registration statements and annual reports. The comment period for the release was originally scheduled to close on May 20, 2022. The new comment period will end on June 17, 2022. This action will allow interested persons additional time to analyze the issues and prepare their comments, which would benefit the Commission in its consideration of final rules.
