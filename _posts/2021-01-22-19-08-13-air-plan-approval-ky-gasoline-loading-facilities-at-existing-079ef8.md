## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the Jefferson County portion of the Kentucky State Implementation Plan (SIP), submitted by the Commonwealth of Kentucky, through the Energy and Environment Cabinet (Cabinet) on September 5, 2019. The revisions were submitted by the Cabinet on behalf of the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District (District) and include amendments related to the standards for existing gasoline loading facilities at bulk terminals and new gasoline loading facilities at bulk plants. The amendments to these standards replace a requirement for gasoline tank trucks to possess a valid Kentucky pressure vacuum test sticker with a requirement for specific vapor tightness testing and recordkeeping procedures, clarify rule applicability, and remove language stating that a pressure measuring device will be supplied by the District. EPA is proposing to approve the revisions because they are consistent with the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act).
