## Summary

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is issuing this advance notice of proposed rulemaking to obtain information regarding the procurement of controlled substances by a medical officer for emergency kits on board ocean vessels, aircraft, and certain other entities. The regulations permitting controlled substances acquired by and dispensed under the general supervision of a medical officer to be stored in and dispensed from emergency kits on board ocean vessels, aircraft, and other entities were established in 1971 and have not been significantly modified since. DEA is considering revising these regulations and seeks to gain a better understanding of the industry's current needs and practices.
