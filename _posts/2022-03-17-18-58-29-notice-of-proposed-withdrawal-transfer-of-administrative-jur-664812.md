## Summary

At the request of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and subject to valid existing rights, the Secretary of the Interior proposes to withdraw 13.50 acres of public land from appropriation under the public land laws, including location and entry under the United States mining laws, but not from leasing under the mineral and geothermal leasing laws, for 100 years, and transfer administrative jurisdiction to FWS to protect and reserve the land for management as part of the Dash Lake Waterfowl Production Area in Towner County, North Dakota. Publication of this notice temporarily segregates the land for up to 2 years from appropriation under the public land laws, including location and entry under the United States mining laws, subject to valid existing rights, but not from leasing under the mineral and geothermal leasing laws, while the application is being processed. The notice initiates a 90-day public comment period and announces an opportunity to request a public meeting on the proposed withdrawal.
