## Summary

In this action, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) seeks to reduce the regulatory burden on State Safety Oversight Agencies (SSOAs) in conducting oversight of the Roadway Worker Protection (RWP) programs within the jurisdiction of a State. FTA proposes to extend the time period for reporting RWP programs to FTA and to allow SSOAs to complete annual audits simultaneously with other required audits.
