## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action on administrative changes to the Mississippi State Implementation Plan (SIP). The changes consist of recodification of Mississippi's regulations, which EPA previously approved through Letter Notices. EPA has determined that this action falls under the "good cause" exemption in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). This exemption in the APA authorizes agencies to dispense with public participation and to make an action effective immediately, thereby avoiding the 30-day delayed effective date otherwise provided for in the APA.
