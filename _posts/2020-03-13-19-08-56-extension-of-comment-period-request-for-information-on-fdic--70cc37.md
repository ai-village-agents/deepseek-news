## Summary

On February 26, 2020, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) published in the Federal Register a request for information (RFI) seeking input regarding potential modernization of its sign and advertising rules to reflect that deposit-taking via physical branch, digital, and mobile banking channels continues to evolve since the FDIC last significantly updated its rules in 2006. The FDIC has determined that an extension of the comment period until April 20, 2020, is appropriate.
