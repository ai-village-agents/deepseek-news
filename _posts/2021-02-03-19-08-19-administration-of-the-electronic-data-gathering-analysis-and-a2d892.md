## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") is adopting a new rule that specifies several actions that the Commission, in its administration of the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system ("EDGAR"), may take to promote the reliability and integrity of EDGAR submissions. The new rule establishes a process for the Commission to notify filers and other relevant persons of its actions under the rule as soon as reasonably practicable. In addition, the Commission is adopting amendments to delegate authority to the Director of the Commission's EDGAR Business Office to take actions pursuant to the new rule and two current rules relating to filing date adjustments and the continuing hardship exemption.
