## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering issuance of an exemption in response to the March 31, 2023, request from Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company (MYAPC or Maine Yankee), for the Maine Yankee Atomic Power Station (MYAPS), located in Wiscasset, Maine. The proposed exemption from NRC regulations, if granted, would permit MYAPC to make withdrawals from a segregated account within Maine Yankee's overall nuclear decommissioning trust (NDT), on an annual basis, for spent fuel and Greater than Class C (GTCC) waste management and non-radiological site restoration without prior notification to the NRC. The NRC staff is issuing an environmental assessment (EA) and finding of no significant impact (FONSI) associated with the proposed exemption.
