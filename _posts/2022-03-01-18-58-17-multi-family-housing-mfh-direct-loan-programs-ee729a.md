## Summary

The Rural Housing Service (RHS or Agency), an agency in the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development Mission area, published a proposed rule in the Federal Register on September 23, 2020, to amend its regulations for the Multi-Family Housing Direct Loans and Grants Programs to implement changes related to the development of a sustainable plan for the Rental Assistance (RA) program. Through this action, RHS is adopting the changes as proposed. The regulation updates are intended to provide additional RA program flexibility and transparency, and to improve the efficiency of managing assets in the Direct Loan portfolio.
