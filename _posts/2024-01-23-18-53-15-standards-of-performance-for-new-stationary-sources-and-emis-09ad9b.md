## Summary

The EPA is proposing amendments to the new source performance standards (NSPS) and emission guidelines (EG) for large municipal waste combustion (MWC) units. These proposed amendments reflect the results from a reevaluation of the maximum achievable control technology (MACT) floor levels, a 5-year review, and the removal of startup, shutdown and malfunction exclusions and exceptions. These proposed amendments also streamline regulatory language, revise recordkeeping and electronic notification and reporting requirements, re-establish new and existing source applicability dates, clarify requirements for certain air curtain incinerators, close a 2007 proposed reconsideration action, correct certain typographical errors, make certain technical corrections, and clarify certain provisions in the NSPS and EG. These proposed amendments would revise all emission limits in the EG, except for carbon monoxide (CO) limits for two subcategories of combustors, and all nine emission limits in the NSPS. The EPA is reevaluating the MACT floors in response to the EPA's voluntary remand of the large MWC rules following a petitioner's request that the EPA review the MACT floors for large MWC units in consideration of a D.C. Circuit Court decision on MACT floor issues. The 5-year review is required by the Clean Air Act (CAA). The proposed amendments would result in an estimated 14,000 tons per year reduction in regulated pollutants.
