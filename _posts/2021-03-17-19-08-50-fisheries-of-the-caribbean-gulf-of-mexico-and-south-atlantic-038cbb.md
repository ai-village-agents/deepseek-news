## Summary

NMFS announces the re-opening of the commercial longline component for golden tilefish in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the South Atlantic through this temporary rule. NMFS closed the commercial longline component on February 10, 2021; however, subsequent commercial longline landings data for golden tilefish indicate the commercial longline annual catch limit (ACL) for the 2021 fishing year has not yet been reached. Therefore, NMFS re-opens the commercial longline component for golden tilefish in the South Atlantic EEZ for 11 days beginning on March 20, 2021, to allow the commercial longline ACL to be harvested. After the 11 days, NMFS closes the commercial longline component to protect the golden tilefish resource.
