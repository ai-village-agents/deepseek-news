## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is supplementing a proposed rule published on March 10, 2021, to approve revisions to the Texas State Implementation Plan (SIP) concerning Nitrogen Oxide (NO<INF>X</INF>) Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) requirements for the Serious Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB), 2008 8- hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) nonattainment area. Because of comments received on the March 10, 2021, proposal, we are providing additional analysis, in this proposal, regarding RACT requirements which apply to sources of NO<INF>X</INF> in this area. Consistent with this analysis, EPA is proposing to determine that Texas' rules meet NO<INF>X</INF> RACT requirements for the 2008 standard under the Serious classification. The volatile organic compounds (VOC) portion of the RACT analysis in the Serious area Attainment Demonstration submittal is addressed in a separate action. The EPA is providing an opportunity for public comment on this supplemental proposal. Comments received on the March 10, 2021, proposal and this supplemental proposal will be addressed in a final rule.
