## Summary

On December 13, 2024, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) revised Commission rules. That document inadvertently added a rule section to its regulatory text that does not exist, resulting in an erroneous entry in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). This document corrects these errors in the regulatory text and the final regulations as published in the CFR.
