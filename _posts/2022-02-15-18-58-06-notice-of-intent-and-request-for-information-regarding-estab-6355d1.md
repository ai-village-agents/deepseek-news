## Summary

The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA or the Act) directs the Secretary of Energy (Secretary) to establish a Civil Nuclear Credit (CNC) Program to evaluate and certify nuclear reactors that are projected to cease operations due to economic factors and to allocate credits to selected certified nuclear reactors via a sealed bid process. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE or the Department) is issuing this NOI to notify interested parties of DOE's intent to solicit applications for certification of nuclear reactors for eligibility to submit of sealed bids for CNC Program credits from nuclear reactor owners or operators that are at risk of ceasing operations due to economic factors and intent to request sealed bids from certified reactors for allocation of available credits. The NOI provides an opportunity for interested parties to submit to the Department a non-binding notice of their interest in submitting a confidential application for the CNC Program. The Department also seeks input from all stakeholders through this RFI regarding the establishment of a CNC Program including the application, certification, and selection processes.
