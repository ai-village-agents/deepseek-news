## Summary

This action proposes special conditions for the Boeing Commercial Airplanes (Boeing) Model 737-800 airplane. This airplane, as modified by Haeco Cabin Solutions (Haeco), will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport category airplanes. This design feature is structure-mounted airbags designed to protect each occupant from serious head injury in the event of an emergency landing. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These proposed special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
