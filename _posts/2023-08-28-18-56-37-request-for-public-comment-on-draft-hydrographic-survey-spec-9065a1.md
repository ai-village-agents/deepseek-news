## Summary

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) Office of Coast Survey (OCS) requests public comment from all interested parties on a draft of the newly-revised Hydrographic Survey Specifications and Deliverables document (HSSD). The HSSD has been rewritten to be more forward looking with respect to new and developing technologies, best facilitate the use of automated tools, and better integrate with the S-100 based products and the National Bathymetric Source (NBS), which is the OCS database for best-available bathymetry. Additionally, the revised HSSD will better accommodate the increasing amounts of hydrographic data obtained from external sources, with metadata tags to denote data quality and universal data licenses to define terms of use, which will result in more streamlined, standardized workflows. Numerous subject matter experts collaborated to modernize the HSSD so that it best supports OCS as a data-driven organization.
