## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to grant a request from the Governor of Texas to reclassify the San Antonio, Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW), and Houston-Galveston Brazoria (HGB) ozone nonattainment areas from Moderate to Serious for the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The EPA is also herein outlining its interpretation that following reclassification, a state is no longer required to submit SIP revisions addressing the following requirements related to the prior reclassification level for an ozone nonattainment area: a demonstration of attainment by the prior attainment date; a Reasonably Available Control Measures (RACM) analysis tied to the prior attainment date; and contingency measures specifically related to the area's failure to attain by the prior attainment date. The EPA is also proposing deadlines for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ or State) to submit revisions to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) addressing the Serious area requirements and for the first transportation control demonstrations for these areas. The EPA is also proposing deadlines for implementation of new Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) rules and for any new or revised Enhanced vehicle Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) programs.
