## Summary

As further discussed below, the Department of Labor (Department) and United States Postal Service (USPS), working with states, plan to provide an in-person option for conducting the identity verification states perform in administering Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits (the "Project"). In this notice, the Department recognizes that for purposes of conducting in-person identity verification in connection with UI benefits, pursuant to a signed Interagency Agreement ("IAA") with the Department, the USPS has in place safeguards adequate to satisfy the requirements of section 303(a)(1), SSA. As a result, including the safeguards and security requirements, do not apply to disclosures of confidential unemployment compensation (UC) information by state UC agencies to the Department, for redisclosure to USPS, for the limited purposes set forth herein.
