## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH Model MBB-BK 117 C-2 and Model MBB-BK 117 D-2 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that a life limit for the adapter forward (FWD) of the outboard load system, repetitive inspections of other components of that system, and for certain helicopters, a modification of the outboard load system, are necessary to address the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would require a modification of the outboard load system for certain helicopters, repetitive inspections of the outboard load system and its components for any defect (including cracking, damage, corrosion, and incorrect installation) and applicable corrective actions, and implementation of a new life limit for the FWD adapter, as specified in a European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
