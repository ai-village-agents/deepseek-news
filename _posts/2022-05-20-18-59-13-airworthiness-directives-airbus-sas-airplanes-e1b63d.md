## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2016-26-05 and AD 2019-21-02, which apply to certain Airbus SAS Model A330-200, A330-200 Freighter, and A330-300 series airplanes. AD 2016- 26-05 and AD 2019-21-02 require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2016-26- 05 and AD 2019-21-02, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary, and new airplanes have been added to the applicability. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2019-21-02 and require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate additional new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
