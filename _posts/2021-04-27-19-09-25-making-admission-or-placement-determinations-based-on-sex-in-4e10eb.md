## Summary

In accordance with the Presidential directive as expressed in the memorandum of January 20, 2021 from the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff, entitled "Regulatory Freeze Pending Review," HUD is reviewing all its pending proposed rules to determine which should move forward. HUD has identified a proposed rule, "Making Admission or Placement Determinations Based on Sex in Facilities Under Community Planning and Development Housing Programs" that is inconsistent with the Executive Order entitled "Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government" and the Executive Order entitled "Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation." This document informs the public that HUD has determined not to pursue this proposed rule previously published in the Federal Register. HUD will proceed to formally withdraw the rule from HUD's upcoming Spring 2021 Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions.
