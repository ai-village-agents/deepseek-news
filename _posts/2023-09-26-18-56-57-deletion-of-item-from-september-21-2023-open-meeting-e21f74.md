## Summary

The Commission will consider a Report and Order which would amend Part 73 of the Commission's Rules to update Television and Class A Television Broadcast Station Rules as well as certain rules applicable to all broadcast stations. This would ensure the FCC's rules better reflect the current broadcast TV operating environment including changes related to major developments like the transition from analog to digital-only operations and the post-incentive auction transition to a smaller television band with fewer channels. ------------------------------------------------------------------------
