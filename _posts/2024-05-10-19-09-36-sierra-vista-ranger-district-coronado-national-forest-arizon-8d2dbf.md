## Summary

The USDA Forest Service, Coronado National Forest, is preparing an environmental impact statement (EIS) to evaluate and disclose the potential environmental effects from the proposed Hermosa Critical Minerals Exploration and Mine Plan of Operations, submitted by South32 Hermosa Inc. (proponent), to occupy and use National Forest System lands for operations associated with an expansion of an underground polymetallic development. The proposed mine plan of operations (MPO) may also require an amendment to the 2018 Coronado National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (forest plan) to include site-specific exceptions to plan direction to accommodate the proposed exploration and mining operations. The Forest Service is providing this public scoping opportunity to gather information to inform the environmental review and decision-making process.
