## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary moving safety zone to surround nearshore operations conducted by a cable laying barge. Cable lay and burial operations will create navigational hazards moving along a corridor from shore extending seaward 12 NM. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters near Virginia Beach, Virginia. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from entering the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Sector Virginia or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
