## Summary

The Safer Choice program in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is accepting submissions for its 2023 Safer Choice Partner of the Year Awards. EPA developed the Partner of the Year Awards to recognize the leadership contributions of Safer Choice partners and stakeholders who have shown achievement in the design, manufacture, selection, and use of products with safer chemicals, that further outstanding or innovative source reduction. Similar achievement in the design, manufacture, selection, and use of Design for the Environment (DfE) -certified products will also make an organization eligible for the Partner of the Year Awards. EPA especially encourages submission of award applications that show how the applicant's work in the design, manufacture, selection, and use of those products promotes environmental justice, bolsters resilience to the impacts of climate change, results in cleaner air or water, improves drinking water quality, or advances innovation in packaging.
