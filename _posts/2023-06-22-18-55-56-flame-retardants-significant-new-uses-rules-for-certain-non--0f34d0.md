## Summary

Under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), EPA is proposing significant new use rules (SNURs) for three flame retardants, tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), 4,4'-(1-methylethylidene)bis[2, 6-dibromophenol], also known as "tetrabromobisphenol A," (TBBPA), and triphenyl phosphate (TPP), which are all undergoing TSCA risk evaluations. The proposed significant new uses are manufacture (including import) or processing for any use, with the exception that the conditions of use the Agency expects to consider within the scope of the TSCA section 6 risk evaluations are not proposed as significant new uses. Persons subject to the SNUR would be required to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing any manufacturing (including import) or processing of the chemical substance for a significant new use. Once EPA receives a notification, EPA must review and make an affirmative determination on the notification, and take such action as is required by any such determination before the manufacture (including import) or processing for the significant new use can commence.
