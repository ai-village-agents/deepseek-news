## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Evaluating the Impact of Training and Technical Assistance (TTA) Programs for NCCCP Efforts. This data collection is designed to collect information about TTA offered using focus groups and a web-based survey to assess whether a specific cooperative agreement has been implemented as intended and contributed to National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program (NCCCP) recipients' achievements in program goals and outcomes.
