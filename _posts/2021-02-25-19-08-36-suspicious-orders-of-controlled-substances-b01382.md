## Summary

On November 2, 2020, the Drug Enforcement Administration published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) soliciting comments on the proposed revisions relating to the suspicious orders of controlled substances. The NPRM provided for a comment period ending on January 4, 2021, and the opportunity to comment ended accordingly. DEA has determined that a reopening of the comment period from February 25, 2021 until March 29, 2021 is appropriate as registrants who would be primarily affected by this rule are uniquely preoccupied with mitigating the global pandemic caused by COVID-19. Accordingly, this reopening will permit additional time to prepare and submit comments.
