## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to deny the exemption application from Western Area Career and Technology Center (WACTC). WACTC requested an exemption from the theory and behind-the-wheel (BTW) instructor requirements contained in the entry-level driver training (ELDT) regulations for one prospective instructor. FMCSA analyzed the exemption application and public comments and determined that the application lacked evidence that would ensure a level of safety equivalent to or greater than would be achieved absent such exemption.
