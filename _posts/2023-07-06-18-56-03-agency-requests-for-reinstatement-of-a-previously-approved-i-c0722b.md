## Summary

The Department of Transportation (DOT) invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection is necessary for the administration of discretionary grant funding, under the ``Local and Regional Project Assistance Program,'' established by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 (November 15, 2021, ``Bipartisan Infrastructure Law'' or ``BIL''), referred to as the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) program. We are required to publish this notice in the Federal Register by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
