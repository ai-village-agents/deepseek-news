## Summary

Nationwide Permits (NWPs) authorize certain activities under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. The NWPs help protect the aquatic environment and the public interest by providing incentives to reduce impacts on jurisdictional waters and wetlands while effectively authorizing activities that have no more than minimal individual and cumulative adverse environmental effects. In this final rule, the Corps is reissuing and modifying 12 existing NWPs and issuing four new NWPs. For these 16 NWPs, the Corps is also reissuing and modifying the NWP general conditions and definitions. The Corps is not reissuing or modifying the remaining 40 existing NWPs or finalizing proposed new NWP E at this time. Those 40 remaining NWPs continue to be in effect under the January 6, 2017, final rule and the existing general conditions and definitions in the 2017 final rule continue to apply to those permits.
