## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to modify the operating schedule that governs the Lansing Island Bridge across Grand Canal, mile 0.7 at Indian Harbour Beach, FL. A request was made to the Coast Guard to allow the drawbridge to remain closed to navigation and untended during the overnight hours due to a lack of requested openings. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
