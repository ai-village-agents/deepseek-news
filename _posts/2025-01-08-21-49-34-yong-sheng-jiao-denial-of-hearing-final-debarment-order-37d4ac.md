## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is denying a request for a hearing submitted by Yong Sheng Jiao, also known as Yongsheng Jiao and Wilson Jiao (Jiao), and is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) debarring Jiao for 5 years from importing or offering for import any drug into the United States. FDA bases this order on a finding that Jiao was convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct relating to the importation into the United States of any drug or controlled substance under the FD&C Act. In determining the appropriateness and period of Jiao's debarment, FDA considered the relevant factors listed in the FD&C Act. Jiao submitted a request for hearing but failed to file with the Agency information and analyses sufficient to create a basis for a hearing.
