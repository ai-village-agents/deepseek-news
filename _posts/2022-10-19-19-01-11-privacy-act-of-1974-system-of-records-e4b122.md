## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention is giving notice that it proposes to modify the Federal Lead-Based Paint Program (FLPP) System of Records pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. To perform Lead-Based Paint or Renovation, Repair, and Painting (RRP) Activities in target housing and child-occupied facilities, EPA requires firms to be certified, individuals to be trained/certified, trainers to be accredited, and individuals to adhere to certain work practice requirements. In addition, firms must notify EPA prior to commencement of lead-based paint abatement activities and accredited training providers must notify EPA with information regarding courses scheduled and provided. The Agency uses the FLPP Database to manage and store information related to the application process for the accreditation of training providers and the certification of firms and individuals who perform abatement and renovation repair and painting activities.
