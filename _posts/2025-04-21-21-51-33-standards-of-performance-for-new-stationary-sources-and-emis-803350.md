## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is closing the reopened comment period on the proposed Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources and Emission Guidelines for Existing Sources: Large Municipal Waste Combustors Voluntary Remand Response and 5-Year Review. The original proposed rule was published on January 23, 2024, with a 60-day comment period closing March 25, 2024. This comment period was reopened on January 16, 2025, for an additional 6 months. The EPA is providing notice that the comment period for this rule will now close on May 30, 2025. We believe that a 6.5-month comment period in total is sufficient for interested stakeholders to submit comments and additional data.
