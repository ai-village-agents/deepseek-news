# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus SAS Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A321-211, -231, and -232 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of false drill starts found around the latch hook mounting holes of certain door frames of the fuselage due to erroneous manufacturing processes. This proposed AD would require a one-time inspection of the area around the latch hook mounting holes of the forward and aft door frames to detect damage from false drill starts, and repair if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
