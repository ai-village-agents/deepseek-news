## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry and FDA entitled "Technical Considerations for Demonstrating Reliability of Emergency- Use Injectors Submitted under a BLA, NDA or ANDA." For injectable drug or biological products that are intended to treat emergent, life- threatening conditions, it is essential to ensure that the emergency- use injector will reliably deliver the drug or biological product as intended. This is particularly critical for drugs when failure of the injector may prevent adequate delivery of a life-saving drug to a patient. The draft guidance describes the technical considerations for demonstrating reliability of emergency-use injectors under a biologics license application (BLA), new drug application (NDA), or abbreviated new drug application (ANDA).
