## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-10-20, which applies to certain ATR-GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42-500 and ATR72-212A airplanes. AD 2021-10-20 requires revising the existing aircraft flight manual (AFM) and applicable corresponding operational procedures to update a systems limitation, limiting dispatch with certain equipment inoperative, performing an operational test of a certain contactor and an electrical test of a certain battery toggle switch, and performing corrective actions if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-10-20, new procedures for modifying the wiring and replacing the battery toggle switch have been developed that would terminate the AD requirements. This proposed AD would continue to require certain actions in AD 2021- 10-20, and would require modifying the battery toggle switch wiring and replacing the battery toggle switch, and would revise the applicability to include additional airplanes, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
