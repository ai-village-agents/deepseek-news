## Summary

The purpose of this modified system of record is to combine SORN 132VAOSDBU with this SORN, 181VAOSDBU, to reflect the merging of the system interfaces. The combined system's purpose is fourfold: To gather and maintain information on small businesses owned and controlled by Veterans, including service-disabled Veterans; provide VA personnel with access to resources that allow them to perform market research upon Veteran Owned Small Businesses (VOSBs) and Service- Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs); provide a platform for registration and announcement of Direct Access Program (DAP) events; and allow Federal, State, and local government personnel and the general public, including private sector companies and corporate entities, the ability to locate potential Veteran entrepreneur resources through searches of the Vendor Information Pages (VIP). This combined system provides the mechanism that enables Veteran owned businesses to compete effectively for Federal contracts. It also provides the Office of Small & Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) with the data and reports needed to manage their responsibilities under the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act of 1999, as amended. VA personnel may utilize the VIP database to counsel and assist Veteran entrepreneurs in starting a small business or expanding an existing small business.
