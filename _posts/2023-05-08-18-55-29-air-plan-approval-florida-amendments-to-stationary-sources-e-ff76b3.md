## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a portion of a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Florida through the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (Department or FL DEP) on April 1, 2022. The portion of the SIP revision proposed for approval seeks to modify a stationary source emission standard applicable to certain fossil fuel steam generators by making several changes to provisions that regulate emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>), nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>), and visible emissions, and by removing certain emission limits that are either obsolete or otherwise regulated by more stringent federally enforceable conditions elsewhere. The portion of the SIP revision also seeks to modify requirements for major stationary sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and NO<INF>X</INF> by removing unnecessary language and certain emission limits that are obsolete. EPA is proposing to approve these changes pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act).
