## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-02- 14, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. AD 2020-02-14 required a one-time inspection of the oxygen containers and adjacent panels and applicable corrective actions. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-02-14, it was determined that additional airplanes may be affected by the same unsafe condition. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2020-02-14 and expands the applicability to include additional airplanes. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
