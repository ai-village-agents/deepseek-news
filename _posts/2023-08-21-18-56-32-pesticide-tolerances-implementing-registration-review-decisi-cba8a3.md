# Pesticide Tolerances; Implementing Registration Review Decisions for Certain Pesticides; Aluminum tris (O-ethylphosphonate), Carbon disulfide, et al.; Technical Correction

## Summary

EPA issued a final rule in the Federal Register of July 19, 2023, finalizing several tolerance actions under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) that the Agency determined were necessary or appropriate during the registration review conducted under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). That document inadvertently instructed the Federal Register to designate a tolerance for ginseng as time-limited, with an expiration date, but used an incorrect footnote number and neglected to include the expiration date. Elsewhere, an instruction to redesignate a paragraph was not clearly stated. This technical correction to the final rule will address these errors.
