# Airworthiness Directives; Viking Air Limited (Type Certificate Previously Held by Bombardier Inc. and de Havilland, Inc.) Airplanes

**Published:** February 05, 2026 18:58 UTC
**Source:** Federal Register
**Original Published:** February 18, 2022 00:00 UTC
**Document Number:** 2022-03459

## Summary

The FAA is correcting a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that published in the Federal Register. The NPRM proposed to issue an airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to all Viking Air Limited Model DHC-2 Mk. I, DHC-2 Mk. II, and DHC-2 Mk. III airplanes. As published, the docket number referenced throughout is incorrect. This document corrects that error. In all other respects, the original document remains the same; however, for clarity, the FAA is publishing the entire proposed rule in the Federal Register.
