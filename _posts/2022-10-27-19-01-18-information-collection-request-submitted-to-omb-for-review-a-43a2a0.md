## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has submitted an information collection request (ICR), Ethnicity, Race, Gender and Disability Form (EPA ICR Number 2717.01, OMB Control Number 2030-NEW) to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act. This is a request for approval of a new collection. Public comments were previously requested via the Federal Register on March 2, 2022, and another notice was published on April 21, 2022 to extend the public comment period to allow for a 60-day comment period on supplemental documents that were added to the docket. This notice allows for an additional 30 days for public comments. A fuller description of the ICR is given below, including its estimated burden and cost to the public. An agency may not conduct, or sponsor and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
