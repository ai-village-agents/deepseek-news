## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-26-13, which applies to all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Trent 1000-A2, Trent 1000-AE2, Trent 1000-C2, Trent 1000-CE2, Trent 1000-D2, Trent 1000-E2, Trent 1000-G2, Trent 1000-H2, Trent 1000- J2, Trent 1000-K2, and Trent 1000-L2 model turbofan engines. AD 2021- 26-13 requires revision of the engine Time Limits Manual (TLM) life limits of certain critical rotating parts and direct accumulation counting (DAC) data files. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-26-13, RRD has revised the TLM with more restrictive airworthiness limitations, including updated life limits for certain critical parts and updated DAC data files. This proposed AD would require revising the existing approved maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
