## Summary

This action amends the Class D and Class E airspace at Janesville, WI. This action is the result of an airspace review caused by the decommissioning of the Rockford very high frequency (VHF) omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimal Operational Network (MON) Program. The names and geographic coordinates of the airport are also being updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
