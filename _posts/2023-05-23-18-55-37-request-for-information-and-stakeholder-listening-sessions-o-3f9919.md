## Summary

The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) is hosting listening sessions and requesting public input about the prevented planting provisions of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (CCIP), Basic Provisions. Prevented planting is a feature of many crop insurance plans that provides a payment to cover certain pre-plant costs for a crop that was prevented from being planted due to an insurable cause of loss. FCIC is interested in public input on the following: additional prevented planting coverage based on harvest prices in situations when harvest prices are higher than established prices initially set by FCIC prior to planting; the requirement that acreage must have been planted to a crop, insured, and harvested, in at least 1 of the 4 most recent crop years; additional levels of prevented planting coverage; prevented planting coverage on contracted crops; and other general prevented planting questions. We invite stakeholders to respond to this request for information or to participate in the listening session(s). All listening sessions will be posted publicly and open to the public for registration.
