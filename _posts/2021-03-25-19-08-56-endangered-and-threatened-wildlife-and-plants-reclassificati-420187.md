## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to reclassify (downlist) the Hawaiian stilt (Himantopus mexicanus knudseni) from endangered to threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). After a review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that the subspecies' status has improved such that it is not currently in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range, but that it is still likely to become so in the foreseeable future. We also propose a rule under section 4(d) of the Act that provides for the conservation of the Hawaiian stilt. Additionally, we also recognize the name "aeo" as an alternative common name.
