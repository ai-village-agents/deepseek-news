## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Safran Helicopter Engines, S.A. (Safran Helicopter Engines) Arriel 1B, Arriel 1C, Arriel 1C2, Arriel 1D1, Astazou XIV B, and Astazou XIV H model turboshaft engines. This AD was prompted by the detection of positive segregation (freckles) on Stage 2 high-pressure turbine (HPT) disks and Stage 3 turbine wheels. This AD requires removal from service of certain Stage 2 HPT disks for Safran Helicopter Engines Arriel 1B, 1C, 1C2, and 1D1 model turbofan engines and affected Stage 3 turbine wheels for Safran Helicopter Engines Astazou XIV B and XIV H model turbofan engines. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
