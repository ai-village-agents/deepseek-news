## Summary

As part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, FinCEN invites comments on the proposed renewal, without change, of a currently approved information collection found in existing Bank Secrecy Act regulations. Specifically, the regulations authorize the Secretary of the Treasury, as appropriate, to promulgate regulations requiring specified financial institutions to file reports with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of certain transactions with designated foreign financial agencies. Although no changes are proposed to the information collection itself, this request for comments covers a future expansion of the scope of the annual hourly burden and cost estimate associated with these regulations. This request for comments is made pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
