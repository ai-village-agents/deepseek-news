## Summary

A Federal Register notice published on November 2, 2022, detailed and sought public comment on recommendations under development by the Bright Futures Pediatric Implementation Program (Bright Futures Program), regarding updates to the HRSA-supported preventive services guidelines for infants, children, and adolescents in the Bright Futures Periodicity Schedule. The proposed updates are specifically related to increasing the upper age limit for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) screening. The Bright Futures Program convenes health professionals to develop draft recommendations for HRSA's consideration. Ten comments were received and considered as detailed below. On December 30, 2022, HRSA accepted as final the Bright Future Program's recommended update to the HIV screening guideline. Under applicable law, non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance issuers offering non- grandfathered group and individual health insurance coverage must include coverage, without cost sharing, for certain preventive services, including those provided for in the HRSA-supported preventive services guidelines for infants, children, and adolescents. The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and the Treasury have previously issued regulations, which describe how group health plans and health insurance issuers apply the coverage requirements.
