## Summary

This final rule amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by adding fourteen entities to the Entity List. These fourteen entities have been determined by the U.S. Government to be acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. These fourteen entities will be listed on the Entity List under the destinations of Germany, Russia, and Switzerland. This rule also corrects six existing entries to the Entity List, one under the destination of Germany and the other five under the destination of China.
