## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of thymol (5-methyl-2-isopropyl-1-phenol) in or on all food commodities when used in accordance with good agricultural practices. Sci Reg, Inc., on behalf of Eden Research PLC, 6 Priory Ct., Priory Court Business Park, Poulton, Cirencester, GL7 5JB, United Kingdom, submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of thymol when used in accordance with this exemption.
