## Summary

The FDIC invites comments on a proposed Statement of Policy (SOP) on Bank Merger Transactions (Proposed SOP) that is relevant to all insured depository institutions (IDIs). The Proposed SOP would replace the FDIC's current SOP on Bank Merger Transactions (Current SOP) and proposes a principles-based overview that describes the FDIC's administration of its responsibilities under the Bank Merger Act (BMA). The Proposed SOP focuses on the scope of transactions subject to FDIC approval, the FDIC's process for evaluating merger applications, and the principles that guide the FDIC's consideration of the applicable statutory factors as set forth in the BMA. The Supplementary Information section below contains explanatory content, including historical data, to provide additional context for the Proposed SOP.
