## Summary

As part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, FinCEN invites comments on the proposed renewal, without change, of a currently approved information collections found in existing Bank Secrecy Act regulations. Specifically, the regulations require dealers in foreign exchange and brokers or dealers in securities to secure and maintain a record of the taxpayer identification number for individuals for whom a transaction or brokerage account is opened, or for whom a line of credit is extended, subject to certain exceptions. The regulations also require that the dealers in foreign exchange and brokers or dealers in securities retain originals or copies of specified documents relating to account and transaction records. Although no changes are proposed to the information collections themselves, this request for comments covers a future expansion of the scope of the annual hourly burden and cost estimate associated with these regulations. This request for comments is made pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
