## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is conducting an administrative review of the countervailing duty (CVD) order on glycine from India for the period of review (POR) January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020. Commerce preliminarily determines that countervailable subsidies are being provided to producers and exporters of glycine from India. In addition, we are also rescinding this review with regard to seven companies for which the request for review was timely withdrawn by interested parties. The preliminary net subsidy rates are listed below in the section titled "Preliminary Results of Administrative Review." Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.
