## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) determines that imports of aluminum wire and cable (AWC) completed in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (Vietnam) using certain AWC inputs manufactured in the People's Republic of China (China) are not covered by the scope of the antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on AWC from China. In addition, Commerce determines that AWC completed in Vietnam using certain AWC inputs manufactured in China are circumventing the AD and CVD orders on AWC from China.
