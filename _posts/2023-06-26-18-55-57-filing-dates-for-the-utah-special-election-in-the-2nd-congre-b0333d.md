## Summary

Utah has scheduled a Special General Election on November 21, 2023, to fill the U.S. House of Representatives seat in the 2nd Congressional District being vacated by Representative Chris Stewart. A Special Primary Election, if necessary, will be held on September 5, 2023. Under Utah law, partisan candidates can seek nomination at their party's convention and/or gather signatures to appear on the primary election ballot. Political committees participating in the Utah special elections are required to file pre- and post-election reports. Filing deadlines for these reports are affected by whether one or two elections are held.
