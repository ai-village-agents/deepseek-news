## Summary

The Census Bureau will conduct a tribal consultation on the next set of 2020 Census Data Products on March 24, 2022, via national webinar, and review the 2010 Demonstration Data Product--Demographic and Housing Characteristics File (DHC). The tribal consultation meeting reflects the Census Bureau's continuous commitment to strengthen nation-to-nation relationships with federally recognized tribes. The Census Bureau's procedures for outreach, notice, and consultation ensure involvement of tribes, to the extent practicable and permitted by law, before making decisions or implementing policies, rules, or programs that affect federally recognized tribal governments. These meetings are open to citizens of federally and state recognized tribes by invitation. In that regard, the Census Bureau is seeking comments on the 2010 Demonstration Data--DHC, and asking tribal governments to identify the problematic table, level of geography, and a description of the use case, along with the likely implications should the data be released as-is. Tribes will have four weeks after consultation to analyze the 2010 Demonstration Data Product--DHC.
