## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving revisions to the Washington State Implementation Plan (SIP) that were submitted by the Department of Ecology (Ecology) in coordination with the Yakima Regional Clean Air Agency (YRCAA). In 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2020, the EPA approved revisions to the General Regulations for Air Pollution Sources promulgated by Ecology in the Washington Administrative Code (WAC). In this action, the EPA is approving an update to the SIP for YRCAA's jurisdiction to reflect these changes to the WAC. We are also approving updates to certain YRCAA regulations currently in the SIP, removing obsolete regulations, and approving a small set of YRCAA regulations to replace or supplement the corresponding WAC regulations for sources in YRCAA's jurisdiction.
