## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD- 500-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports that, during instrument landing system (ILS) approaches, the flight control system reverted from primary flight control computer (PFCC) normal mode operating in autopilot to remote electronics unit (REU) direct mode, and then, after a period of time, to PFCC direct mode. This proposed AD would require installation of a PFCC software update; and a records review or detailed inspection to identify pre-existing repairs or damage within certain limits to certain structures, and obtaining and following additional instructions if necessary; as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
