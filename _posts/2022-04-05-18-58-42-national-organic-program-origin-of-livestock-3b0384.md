## Summary

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) amends the origin of livestock requirements for dairy animals under the USDA organic regulations with this final rule. AMS is taking this action to increase uniformity in origin of livestock production practice for organic dairy animals, and reduce variance between the approaches taken by certifying agents. The policy choices in this rule align with practices that many certifiers and most organic operations already follow, and align with the public comments on the rule. This rule specifies that organic milk and milk products must be from animals that have been under continuous organic management from the last third of gestation onward, with an exception for newly certified organic livestock operations.
