## Summary

This action proposes to establish Class D airspace for Craig Field, Selma, AL, as a new air traffic control tower will service the airport. This action would also amend Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface by updating the radius and geographic coordinates of the airport. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.
