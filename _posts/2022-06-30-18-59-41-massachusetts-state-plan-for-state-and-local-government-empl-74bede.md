## Summary

The Massachusetts Department of Labor Standards (the DLS) has submitted a developmental State Plan for occupational safety and health, applicable only to State and local Government employment (workers of the State and its political subdivisions) (Massachusetts State Plan), for determination of initial approval under Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (the OSH Act). In this notification, OSHA proposes to grant the Massachusetts State Plan initial approval based on its preliminary assessment that the Massachusetts State Plan meets, or will meet within three years, OSHA's State Plan approval criteria, and that Massachusetts has provided adequate assurances that it will be at least as effective as Federal OSHA in protecting the safety and health of Massachusetts state and local government workers. OSHA proposes to fund initial approval of the Massachusetts State Plan from the State Plan funding available in the Department of Labor's Fiscal Year 2022 budget.
