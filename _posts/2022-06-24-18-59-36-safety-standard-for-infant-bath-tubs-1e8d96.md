## Summary

In March 2017, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) published a consumer product safety standard for infant bath tubs under section 104 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA). The standard incorporated by reference the 2017 ASTM voluntary standard for infant bath tubs that was in effect at the time. The CPSIA sets forth a process for updating mandatory standards for durable infant or toddler products that are based on a voluntary standard, when the voluntary standards organization revises the standard. Consistent with the CPSIA's update process, the Commission issued a direct final rule in October 2018, that revised the incorporation by reference for the mandatory standard for infant bath tubs to reflect ASTM's revised 2018 voluntary standard. Also consistent with the CPSIA's update process, this direct final rule again updates the mandatory standard for infant bath tubs to incorporate by reference ASTM's 2022 version of the voluntary standard.
