## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) enables Uncrewed Aircraft System (UAS) operators to access dedicated spectrum for control-related communications. Specifically, this document adopts service rules under new rule part 88 that provide operators the ability to obtain direct frequency assignments in a portion of the 5030-5091 MHz band for non-networked operation. Under these rules, one or more dynamic frequency management systems (DFMSs) will manage and coordinate access to the spectrum and enable its safe and efficient use, by providing requesting operators with temporary frequency assignments to support UAS control link communications with a level of reliability suitable for operations in controlled airspace and other safety-critical circumstances. To address concerns regarding the impact of these aeronautical operations on adjacent services, this document locates these operations, for now, in the central part of the band, with substantial separation from the bands adjacent to the 5030- 5091 MHz band.
