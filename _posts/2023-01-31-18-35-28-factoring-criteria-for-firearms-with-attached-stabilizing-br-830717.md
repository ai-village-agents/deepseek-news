## Summary

The Department of Justice ("Department" or "DOJ") is amending the regulations of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives ("ATF") to clarify when a rifle is designed, made, and intended to be fired from the shoulder. Specifically, under the Gun Control Act of 1968 ("GCA") and the National Firearms Act of 1934 ("NFA") the definition of "rifle" shall include a weapon that is equipped with an accessory, component, or other rearward attachment (e.g., a "stabilizing brace") that provides surface area that allows the weapon to be fired from the shoulder, provided other factors, as described in this preamble and in the amended regulations, indicate that the weapon is designed, made, and intended to be fired from the shoulder.
