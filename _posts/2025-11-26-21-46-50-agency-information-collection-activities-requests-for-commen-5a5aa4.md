## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on May 22, 2025. The information collected on the FAA Form 8120-11 is reported voluntarily by manufacturers, repair stations, aircraft owner/operators, air carriers, and the general public who wish to report the discovery of, and potential use or possession of aircraft suspected unapproved parts to the FAA for review. The report information is collected and evaluated by the FAA, Aviation Safety Hotline Program Office, and used to determine if an unapproved part investigation is warranted.
