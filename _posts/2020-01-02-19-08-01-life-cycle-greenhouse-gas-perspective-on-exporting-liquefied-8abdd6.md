## Summary

On September 19, 2019, the Office of Fossil Energy (FE) of the Department of Energy (DOE) gave notice of the availability of a study entitled, Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Perspective on Exporting Liquefied Natural Gas from the United States: 2019 Update (LCA GHG Update or Update), in the above-referenced proceedings and invited the submission of public comments on the Update. DOE commissioned the LCA GHG Update to inform its decision on pending and future applications seeking authorization to export domestically produced liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the lower-48 states to countries with which the United States does not have a free trade agreement (FTA) requiring national treatment for trade in natural gas, and with which trade is not prohibited by U.S. law or policy (non-FTA countries). The LCA GHG Update includes three principal updates to DOE's 2014 LCA GHG Report. In this document, DOE responds to the seven public comments received on the LCA GHG Update and summarizes its conclusions on the Update. The LCA GHG Update and the public comments are posted on the DOE website at: https://fossil.energy.gov/app/ docketindex/docket/index/21.
