## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), correct the information provided in the "Where listed" column of the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife (List) for eight species listed as endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Errors introduced into the List may be interpreted as indicating that only some populations of these species are listed. We are correcting the List to clarify that protections apply to these species wherever found.
