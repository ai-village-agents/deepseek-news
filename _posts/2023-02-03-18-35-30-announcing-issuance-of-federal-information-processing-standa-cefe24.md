## Summary

This notice announces the Secretary of Commerce's approval of Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 186-5, Digital Signature Standard (DSS). FIPS 186-5 specifies three techniques for the generation and verification of digital signatures that can be used for the protection of data: the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) Algorithm, the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), and the Edwards Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA). The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), specified in prior versions of this standard, is retained only for the purposes of verifying existing signatures.
