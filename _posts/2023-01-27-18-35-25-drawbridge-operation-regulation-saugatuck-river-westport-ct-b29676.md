## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to modify the operating schedule that governs the Metro-North (SAGA) Bridge, across the Saugatuck River, mile 1.1, at Westport, CT. The bridge owner, Metro-North (MNR), submitted a request on May 5, 2022 to modify the regulation to align with the Metro-North "WALK" Bridge train schedule and avoid bridge openings during peak transit hours. It is expected that this change to the regulations will better serve the needs of the community while continuing to meet the reasonable needs of navigation. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
