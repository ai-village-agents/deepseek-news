## Summary

This action proposes to remove Class E airspace in Honesdale, PA, as Spring Hill Airport has been abandoned, and controlled airspace is no longer required. This action would also amend Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface for Cherry Ridge Airport, and update the airport's geographic coordinates to coincide with the FAA's database. This action would enhance the safety and management of controlled airspace within the national airspace system.
