## Summary

On August 12, 2020, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published the final National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP): Miscellaneous Organic Chemical Manufacturing Residual Risk and Technology Review. Subsequently, the Agency received and granted petitions for reconsideration on two issues, specifically, the use of the EPA's 2016 Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) value for ethylene oxide in assessing cancer risk for the source category and the use of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) risk value for ethylene oxide as an alternative risk value to the EPA's IRIS value. Here, the EPA is addressing these two issues and is also requesting public comment. The EPA is seeking comment only on the two identified petition issues. The EPA will not respond to comments addressing any other issues or any other provisions of the final rule.
