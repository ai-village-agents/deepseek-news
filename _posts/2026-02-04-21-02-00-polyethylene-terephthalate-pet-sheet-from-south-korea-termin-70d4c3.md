## Summary

The Commission instituted the subject five-year review on August 1, 2025 to determine whether revocation of the antidumping duty order on Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) Sheet from South Korea would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury. Due to the lapse in appropriations and Federal Government shutdown, on November 14, 2025, the Department of Commerce ("Commerce") tolled all deadlines in administrative proceedings by 47 days. Additionally, due to a backlog of documents that were electronically filed via Enforcement and Compliance's Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Centralized Electronic Service System (ACCESS) during the Federal Government shutdown, on November 24, 2025, Commerce tolled all deadlines in administrative proceedings by an additional 21 days. On January 12, 2026, Commerce published notice in the Federal Register that it was revoking the order effective January 12, 2026, because no domestic interested party filed a timely notice of intent to participate. Accordingly, the subject review is terminated.
