## Summary

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) invites public comment on one currently-approved Information Collection Request (ICR), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number 1652-0074, abstracted below, that we will submit to OMB for an extension in compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). On October 26, 2022, OMB approved TSA's request for an emergency approval of this collection to address the ongoing cybersecurity threat to surface transportation and associated infrastructure. TSA is now seeking to renew the collection, which expires on April 30, 2023, with incorporation of the subject of the emergency request. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected burden. The collection allows TSA to address the ongoing cybersecurity threat to surface transportation systems and associated infrastructure.
