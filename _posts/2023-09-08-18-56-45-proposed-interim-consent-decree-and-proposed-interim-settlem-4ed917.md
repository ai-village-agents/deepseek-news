## Summary

In accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator's March 18, 2022, memorandum regarding "Consent Decrees and Settlement Agreements to resolve Environmental Claims Against the Agency," notice is hereby given of a proposed interim consent decree and proposed interim settlement agreement in Northwest Environmental Advocates v. EPA, No. 19-01537 (W.D. Wash.). On September 26, 2019, Plaintiff Northwest Environmental Advocates filed a complaint alleging that EPA failed to perform duties mandated by the Clean Water Act (CWA) regarding Washington's obligation to develop Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) to address waters identified on the state's impaired waters list and that EPA's inaction was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), among other claims. EPA seeks public input on a proposed interim consent decree and proposed interim settlement agreement prior to its final decision-making regarding entering into the proposed documents.
