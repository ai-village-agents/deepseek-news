## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) established the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program (EBB Program) to support broadband services and devices to help low-income households. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (CAA) established an Emergency Broadband Connectivity Fund of $3.2 billion in the Treasury of the United States for the fiscal year 2021, to remain available until expended. The CAA directed the Commission to use the fund to establish the EBB Program, under which eligible low-income households may receive a discount off the cost of broadband service and certain connected devices during an emergency period related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
