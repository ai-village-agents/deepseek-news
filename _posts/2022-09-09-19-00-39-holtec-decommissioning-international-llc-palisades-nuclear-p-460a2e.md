## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is correcting a notice that was published in the Federal Register (FR) on August 26, 2022, regarding the post-shutdown decommissioning activities report (PSDAR) for the Palisades Nuclear Plant (Palisades). This notice provided receipt of the Palisades PSDAR and made it available for public comment, including the details of a public meeting in the vicinity of the Palisades site to discuss and collect comments on the PSDAR. This action is necessary to correct the time zone listed in association with the public meeting. The original notice lists the Palisades PSDAR public meeting time as 6 p.m. until 8 p.m. central time (CT), but the meeting will take place from 6 p.m. until 8 p.m. eastern time (ET), which is the local time zone for the Palisades site.
