## Summary

The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) is announcing the initiation of the annual review of the eligibility of the sub-Saharan African countries to receive the benefits of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). The AGOA Implementation Subcommittee of the Trade Policy Staff Committee (AGOA TPSC Subcommittee) is developing recommendations for the President on AGOA country eligibility for calendar year 2023 and requests comments for this review. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the AGOA TPSC Subcommittee will foster public participation via written submissions rather than an in-person hearing. This notice includes the schedule for submission of comments and responses to questions from the AGOA TPSC Subcommittee related to this review.
