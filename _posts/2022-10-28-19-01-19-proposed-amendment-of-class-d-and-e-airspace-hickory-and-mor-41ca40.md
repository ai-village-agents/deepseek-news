## Summary

This action proposes to amend Class D airspace and Class E surface airspace for Hickory Regional Airport, Hickory, NC, as runways one and nineteen have been permanently closed. This action would also amend Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface for Foothills Regional Airport, Morganton, NC, by updating the airport's name and geographic coordinates and removing Grace Hospital from the description. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.
