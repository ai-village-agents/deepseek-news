## Summary

The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is amending the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by removing three (3) persons from the Unverified List (UVL). The three persons are removed from the UVL on the basis that BIS was able to verify their bona fides (i.e., legitimacy and reliability relating to the end use and end user of items subject to the EAR) through successful end-use checks.
