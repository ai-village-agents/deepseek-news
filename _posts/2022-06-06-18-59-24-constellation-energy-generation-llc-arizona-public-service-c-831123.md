## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued four exemptions in response to requests from Arizona Public Service Company; Constellation Energy Generation, LLC; and Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC. The exemptions will allow the licensees to deviate from the requirements for the MAGNASTOR[supreg] storage cask system in Certificate of Compliance No. 1031, Amendment No. 7 and Amendment No. 9, by utilizing storage cask lids that were not fabricated in accordance with the requirements of two codes issued by the American Concrete Institute. The NRC is issuing a single notice to announce the issuance of these exemptions because these are nearly identical.
