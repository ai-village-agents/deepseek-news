## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), located within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has determined that a modification to the attenuated, excluded strain Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV) TC-83 has been shown to increase its virulence. The modified VEEV strain TC-83(A3G) demonstrated increased pathogenicity and lethality. Therefore, the modified VEEV strain TC-83(A3G) is not an excluded strain but is a select agent and is subject to regulation.
