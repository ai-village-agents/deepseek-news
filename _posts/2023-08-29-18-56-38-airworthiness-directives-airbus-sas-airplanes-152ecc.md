## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-10- 08, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A320-214, -251N, and - 271N airplanes. AD 2022-10-08 required a one-time detailed inspection of the affected passenger seats and corrective actions if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-10-08, it was determined that additional passenger seats are affected. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2022-10-08, and also requires inspecting additional affected passenger seats; as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
