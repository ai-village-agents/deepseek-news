## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its spent fuel storage regulations by revising the TN Americas LLC NUHOMS[supreg] EOS Dry Spent Fuel Storage System listing within the "List of approved spent fuel storage casks" to include Amendment No. 1 to Certificate of Compliance No. 1042. Amendment No. 1 makes the following changes: Adds a new basket type (Type 4) to allow for the loading of intact, damaged, or failed fuel; adds another new basket type (Type 5) with low conductivity poison basket plates and low emissivity coated steel basket plates; accepts fuel assemblies with a minimum two-year cooling time, in selected locations within the basket; adds the NUHOMS[supreg] MATRIX design as an alternative to the EOS horizontal storage module design for the storage of spent fuel; and makes additional revisions to the certificate of compliance and the technical specifications for consistency and clarity.
