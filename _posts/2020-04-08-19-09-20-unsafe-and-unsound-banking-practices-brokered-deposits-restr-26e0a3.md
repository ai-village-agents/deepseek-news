## Summary

On February 10, 2020, the FDIC published in the Federal Register a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) entitled "Unsafe and Unsound Banking Practices: Brokered Deposits Restrictions," proposing revisions to its regulations relating to the brokered deposits restrictions that apply to less than well capitalized insured depository institutions. The NPR provided for a 60-day comment period, which would have closed on April 10, 2020. The FDIC has determined that an extension of the comment period until June 9, 2020, is appropriate. This action will allow interested parties additional time to analyze the proposal and prepare comments.
