## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-12- 08, which applied to all BAE Systems (Operations) Limited Model BAe 146-100A, -200A, and -300A airplanes; and Model Avro 146-RJ70A, 146- RJ85A, and 146-RJ100A airplanes. AD 2017-12-08 required revising the maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or revised structural inspection requirements. This AD requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. This AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
