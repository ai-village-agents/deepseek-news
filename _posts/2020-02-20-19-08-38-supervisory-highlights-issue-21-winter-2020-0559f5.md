The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) is issuing its twenty first edition of Supervisory Highlights. In this issue of Supervisory Highlights, we report examination findings in the areas of debt collection, mortgage servicing, payday lending and student loan servicing that were completed between April 2019 and August 2019. The report does not impose any new or different legal requirements, and all violations described in the report are based only on those specific facts and circumstances noted during those examinations.
