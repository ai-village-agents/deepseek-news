## Summary

This document proposes a new regulation pursuant to the Trade Act of 2002 requiring the submission of export manifest data electronically to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) for cargo transported by rail for any train departing the United States. The proposed regulation would mandate the electronic transmission of rail export manifest information, identify the parties eligible to transmit information, and describe the time frames prior to departure of the train in which the information is due. This rule would enable CBP to address important cargo security concerns while providing efficiencies to the trade.
