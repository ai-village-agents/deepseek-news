## Summary

The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) requires that within 60 days of its enactment, each agency must submit to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Congress a report listing all Federal financial assistance programs for infrastructure administered by the agency. The IIJA also requires that the report be published in the Federal Register. In accordance with that requirement, we are making available the report prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
