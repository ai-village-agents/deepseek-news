## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC or Commission) is issuing this Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM or Notice) and seeking public comment regarding potential regulatory amendments under the Commodity Exchange Act governing the risk management programs of swap dealers, major swap participants, and futures commission merchants. In particular, the Commission is seeking information and public comment on several issues stemming from the adoption of certain risk management programs, including the governance and structure of such programs, the enumerated risks these programs must monitor and manage, and the specific risk considerations they must take into account; the Commission further seeks comment on how the related periodic risk reporting regime could be altered or improved. The Commission intends to use the information and comments received from this Notice to inform potential future agency action, such as a rulemaking, with respect to risk management.
