## Summary

NMFS received a request from Carnival Corporation & GHD (Carnival) for the renewal of their currently active incidental harassment authorization (IHA) to take marine mammals incidental to pile driving for the Long Beach Cruise Terminal improvement project at the Port of Long Beach, California. These activities are nearly identical to those covered through the current authorization. Pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act, prior to issuing the original IHA, NMFS requested comments on both the proposed IHA and the potential for renewing the initial authorization if certain requirements were satisfied. The renewal requirements have been satisfied, and NMFS is now providing an additional 15-day comment period to allow for any additional comments on the proposed renewal not previously provided during the initial 30-day comment period.
