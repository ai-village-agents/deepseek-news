## Summary

This notice advises the public that the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is seeking comments for the proposed revision of Voluntary Product Standard (PS) 20-20, "American Softwood Lumber Standard." This standard, prepared by the American Lumber Standard Committee, serves the procurement and regulatory needs of numerous Federal, State, and local government agencies by providing for uniform, industry-wide grade-marking and inspection requirements for softwood lumber. The implementation of the standard also allows for uniform labeling and auditing of treated wood and, through a Memorandum of Understanding with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, labeling and auditing of wood packaging materials for international trade. As part of a five-year review process, NIST is seeking public comment and invites interested parties to review the revised standard and submit comments.
