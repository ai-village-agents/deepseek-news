## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to provisionally renew a United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) exemption from various provisions of the mandate to use electronic logging devices (ELD). FMCSA previously granted the exemption to allow (1) all motor carriers and drivers that use portable, driver-based ELDs to record engine data only when the driver is in a commercial motor vehicle (CMV) and the engine is powered, and (2) all motor carriers to configure an ELD with a yard- move mode that does not require a driver to re-input yard-move status every time the tractor is powered off. The Agency has determined that renewal of the temporary exemption would not have an adverse impact on safety, and that a level of safety equivalent to or greater than that provided by the regulation would be maintained. The exemption renewal is for 5 years.
