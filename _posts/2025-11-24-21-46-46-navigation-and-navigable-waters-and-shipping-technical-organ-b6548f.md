## Summary

This final rule makes non-substantive, technical, organizational, and conforming amendments to existing Coast Guard regulations. This represents a continuation of our practice of periodically issuing rules to keep our regulations up-to-date and accurate. This final rule is deregulatory in nature due to the discontinuation of the Information Collection Request (ICR), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Control Number 1625-0068. In all other respects, this final rule will have no substantive impact on the regulated public.
