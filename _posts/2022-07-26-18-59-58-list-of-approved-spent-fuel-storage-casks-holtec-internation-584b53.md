## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its spent fuel storage regulations by revising the Holtec International HI-STORM Flood/Wind Multipurpose Canister Storage System listing within the "List of approved spent fuel storage casks" to include Amendment No. 8 to Certificate of Compliance No. 1032. Amendment No. 8 revises the description in the certificate of compliance for the Holtec International HI-STORM Flood/Wind system to clearly indicate that only the portions of the components that contact the pool water need to be made of stainless steel or aluminum. Amendment No. 8 also incorporates other minor editorial corrections.
