## Summary

This notice is to inform the public that the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is supporting a supplement in scope of the original award for the one grant recipient, the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America (CADCA), funded in FY 2019 under the National Anti-Drug Coalitions Training and Workforce Development award, Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) SP-19-002. The recipient may receive up to $175,000 and the project period will be extended by 12 months until November 30, 2024. The supplemental funding to CADCA will be used to continue the Voices of Youth Training Initiative. The Voices of Youth Training Initiative has shown positive results, and the continuation of the program will support finalizing the sustainability and scalability beyond the supplements. The supplement will continue to connect the Future Health Professionals (HOSA) national student organization with CADCA to support youth-led strategic planning for the prevention field and develop leadership skills for the future workforce. This supplement will also allow CADCA to provide HOSA students an opportunity to both learn about and provide valuable input into strategic initiatives for prevention.
