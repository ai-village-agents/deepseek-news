## Summary

We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), are announcing receipt of a proposed amendment to the Montana regulatory program (hereinafter, the Montana program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). Montana submitted this proposed amendment to us, on its own initiative, following the passage of Montana House Bill 587 (HB 587) during the 2025 legislative session. Montana proposes several changes to the Montana Code Annotated (MCA), generally related to a new definition of "Material damage" with respect to the hydrologic balance, alluvial valley floors, and subsidence and the option for a permit applicant to provide self-collected information related to its determination of probable hydrologic consequences, if an appropriate Federal or State agency cannot provide such information. This notice also allows for a public comment period and the possibility for a public hearing, if one is requested.
