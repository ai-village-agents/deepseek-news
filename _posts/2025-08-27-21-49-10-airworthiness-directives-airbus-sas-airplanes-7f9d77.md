## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A318-111, -112, -121, and -122 airplanes; A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, -133, -151N, -153N, and - 171N airplanes; A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, -233, -251N, - 252N, -253N, -271N, -272N, and -273N airplanes; and A321-111, -112, - 131, -211, -212, -213, -231, -232, -251N, -252N, -253N, -271N, -272N, - 251NX, -252NX, -253NX, -253NY, -271NX, and -272NX airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that new airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new airworthiness limitations. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
