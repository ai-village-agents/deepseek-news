## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain ATR--GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42 and ATR72 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that a flight deck emergency escape hatch was difficult to open due to the hose ends being connected to the hatch with incorrect parts and/or installed collars with a too- small diameter that would not permit the drain hose to slide inside. This AD requires inspection of the flight deck emergency escape hatch drain hose for discrepancies and applicable corrective actions, and prohibits accomplishment of maintenance actions using the instructions of certain maintenance tasks, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
