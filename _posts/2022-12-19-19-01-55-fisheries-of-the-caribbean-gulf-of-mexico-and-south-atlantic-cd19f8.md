## Summary

NMFS issues this temporary rule to extend the expiration date of emergency measures implemented for the greater amberjack stock in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf). As requested by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council), NMFS published a temporary rule for emergency action on July 25, 2022, to modify the greater amberjack recreational fixed closed season for the 2022-2023 fishing year in the Gulf exclusive economic zone (EEZ) to be August 1 through 31, 2022, and November 1, 2022, through July 31, 2023 (open September 1, 2022, through October 31, 2022). The purpose of this rulemaking is to extend the measures implemented in the emergency action while the Council develops long term management measures to reduce overfishing of Gulf greater amberjack.
