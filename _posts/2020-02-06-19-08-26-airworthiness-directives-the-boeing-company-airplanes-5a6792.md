## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-15- 04, which applied to certain The Boeing Company Model 787-8 and 787-9 airplanes. AD 2017-15-04 required replacement of affected electromechanical actuators (EMAs). This AD retains the requirements of AD 2017-15-04; expands the applicability to include all The Boeing Company Model 787 series airplanes; and adds a new requirement to identify, for certain airplanes, the part number of EMAs and to replace affected EMAs. This AD was prompted by wire harness chafing on the EMAs for certain spoilers due to insufficient separation with adjacent structure. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
