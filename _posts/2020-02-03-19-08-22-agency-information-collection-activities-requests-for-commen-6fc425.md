## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on November 7, 2019. The collection involves the voluntary submission of application information for persons applying to become designated representatives of the FAA Administrator under 14 CFR part 183. The information to be collected will be used by the FAA to screen and select designees who will act as representatives of the FAA Administrator in performing various certification and examination functions under Title VI of the Federal Aviation Act. This notice corrects information in the 60-day notice stating the collection applies only to DER applicants using FAA Form 8110-4. The collection applies to all applicants for designation under 14 CFR part 183 and includes four (4) forms in total. Additionally, the FAA is introducing the Designee Management System (DMS), a web-based application to provide for electronic information submission by applicants.
