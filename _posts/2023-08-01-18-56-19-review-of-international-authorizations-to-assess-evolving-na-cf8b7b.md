## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (Commission) takes another important step to protect the nation's telecommunications infrastructure from threats in an evolving national security and law enforcement landscape by proposing comprehensive changes to the Commission's rules that allow carriers to provide international telecommunications service. The Commission proposes rules that would require carriers to renew, every 10 years, their international authorizations. In the alternative, the Commission seeks comment on adopting rules that would require all international authorization holders to periodically update information enabling the Commission to review the public interest and national security implications of those authorizations based on that updated information. Through these proposals, the Commission seeks to ensure that the Commission is exercising appropriate oversight of international authorization holders to safeguard U.S. telecommunications networks.
