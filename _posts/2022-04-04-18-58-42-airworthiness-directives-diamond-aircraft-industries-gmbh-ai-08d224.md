## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-18- 10, which applied to certain Diamond Aircraft Industries GmbH (DAI) Model DA 42, DA 42 M-NG, and DA 42 NG airplanes. AD 2017-18-10 required modifying the flap control system, repetitively inspecting the flap bell crank, and replacing the flap bell crank as necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2017-18-10, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) superseded its mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) to correct an unsafe condition on these products. This AD retains the actions required by AD 2017-18-10, expands the applicability, and prohibits the installation of certain flap bell cranks. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
