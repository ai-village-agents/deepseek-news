## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing an order approving the direct transfer of operating authority for Renewed Facility Operating License No. DPR-20 for the Palisades Nuclear Plant (PNP) and the general license for the Palisades Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI) from the current holder, Holtec Decommissioning International, LLC (HDI), to Palisades Energy, LLC (OPCO). Holtec Palisades, LLC, will remain the licensed owner of PNP and the PNP ISFSI. The NRC is also issuing a conforming amendment to the facility operating license for administrative purposes to reflect the license transfer from HDI to OPCO. This license transfer is part of the regulatory approvals necessary to reauthorize power operations at PNP.
