## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or the Commission) received and is considering approval of a request to amend three licenses. The request is for Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1, 2, and 3. For each license amendment, the NRC proposes to determine that it involves no significant hazards consideration (NSHC). Because the amendment request contains sensitive unclassified non- safeguards information (SUNSI), the NRC is issuing an order imposing procedures to obtain access to SUNSI for contention preparation by persons who file a hearing request or petition for leave to intervene.
