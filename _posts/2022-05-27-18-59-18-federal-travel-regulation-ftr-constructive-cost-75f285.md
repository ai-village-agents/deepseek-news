## Summary

GSA proposes to amend the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) to clarify the concept of "constructive cost" as it relates to temporary duty travel, and clarify a section regarding what mode of transportation agencies should compare privately owned vehicle costs to when preparing a cost construction. These clarifications are intended to produce better estimates for decision makers.
