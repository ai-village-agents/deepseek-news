## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-21- 05, which applied to certain Saab AB Model 340A (SAAB/SF340A) and SAAB 340B airplanes. AD 2017-21-05 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate airworthiness limitations, including new inspection tasks for the drag brace support fitting of the main landing gear (MLG) and tasks related to the corrosion prevention and control program (CPCP). This AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2017-21-05 and requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference (IBR). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
