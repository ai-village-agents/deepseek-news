## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Schempp-Hirth Flugzeugbau GmbH Model Duo Discus and Duo Discus T gliders. This AD was prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as cracks in the connecting tube of the elevator U-bracket of the horizontal tail, which could compromise the stiffness of the elevator control system and of the attachment of the horizontal tail. This AD requires repetitively inspecting the elevator U-bracket for cracks and broken weld seams, the rear connection between the horizontal tail and the rear attachment on the fuselage for play and softness, and the foam support for compression between the vertical and horizontal tail, and replacing or repairing damaged parts as applicable. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
