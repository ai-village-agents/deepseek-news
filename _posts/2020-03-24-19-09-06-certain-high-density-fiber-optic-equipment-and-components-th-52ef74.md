## Summary

Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on February 21, 2020, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of Corning Optical Communications LLC of Charlotte, North Carolina. Supplements to the complaint were filed on March 2, 2020, March 11, 2020, and March 13, 2020. The complaint, as supplemented, alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain high-density fiber optic equipment and components thereof by reason of infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 9,020,320 ("the '320 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 8,712,206 ("the '206 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 10,120,153 ("the '153 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 10,094,996 ("the '996 patent"); and U.S. Patent No. 10,444,456 ("the '456 patent"). The complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The complainant requests that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a general exclusion order, or in the alternative a limited exclusion order, and cease and desist orders.
