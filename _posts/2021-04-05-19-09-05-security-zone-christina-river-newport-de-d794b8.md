## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a security zone for the protection of Very Important Persons (VIPs) as they transit by vehicle on the route 141 bridge over the Christina River near Newport, Delaware. The security zone will be enforced intermittently and only during times of a protected VIP transit over the bridge and will restrict vessel traffic while the zone is being enforced. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from entering or remaining within the security zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Delaware Bay or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
