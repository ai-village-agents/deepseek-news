## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the Northern Sierra Air Quality Management District (NSAQMD or "District") portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). This revision concerns the District's demonstration regarding reasonably available control technology (RACT) requirements for the 2015 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS or "standards") in the Western Nevada County ("Western Nevada") ozone nonattainment area (NAA), which is under the jurisdiction of the NSAQMD. We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
