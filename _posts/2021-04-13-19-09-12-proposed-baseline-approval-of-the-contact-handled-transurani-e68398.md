## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) is announcing the availability of, and soliciting public comments on, the proposed "baseline" approval of the contact-handled (CH) transuranic (TRU) debris waste characterization program implemented by the Central Characterization Program (CCP) at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Savannah River Site (SRS), in Aiken, South Carolina. The inspections supporting this proposed baseline approval took place from November 30 through December 2, 2020, remotely and at SRS. The EPA identified no findings or concerns and proposes to approve the SRS CH TRU debris waste characterization program. The EPA's report documenting the inspection results and proposed baseline approval is available for review in the public docket listed in the ADDRESSES section of this document. Until the Agency finalizes its baseline approval decision, the DOE Carlsbad Field Office may not certify SRS' waste characterization program and the site may not ship transuranic waste to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant for disposal.
