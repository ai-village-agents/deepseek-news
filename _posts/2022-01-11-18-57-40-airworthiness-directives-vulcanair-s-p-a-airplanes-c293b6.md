## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain km, Vulcanair S.p.A. Model P.68C, P.68C-TC, P.68 "OBSERVER," P.68 OBSERVER 2, P.68R, and P.68TC OBSERVER airplanes. This AD was prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as a damaged stabilator trim control cable. This AD requires inspecting the stabilator trim control cables and replacing if necessary. This AD also requires reporting the results of each inspection to Vulcanair S.p.A. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
