# Energy Conservation Program: Test Procedure for Dehumidifiers

## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") proposes to amend the test procedure for dehumidifiers. The proposed amendments would reference the current version of an applicable industry standard; allow the rating test period to be 2 or 6 hours; permit the use of a sampling tree in conjunction with an aspirating psychrometer for testing a dehumidifier with a single process air intake grille; and specify for dehumidifiers with network capabilities that all network functions must be disabled throughout testing. DOE is seeking comment from interested parties on the proposal.
