## Summary

This document contains final regulations concerning the election under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 to treat the amount of certain tax credits as a payment of Federal income tax. The regulations describe rules for the elective payment of these credit amounts in a taxable year, including definitions and special rules applicable to partnerships and S corporations and regarding repayment of excessive payments. In addition, the regulations describe rules related to a required IRS pre-filing registration process. These regulations affect tax-exempt organizations, State and local governments, Indian tribal governments, Alaska Native Corporations, the Tennessee Valley Authority, rural electric cooperatives, and, in the case of three of these credits, certain taxpayers eligible to elect the elective payment of credit amounts in a taxable year.
