# Pacific Island Fisheries; 2022-2025 Annual Catch Limits and Accountability Measures for Main Hawaiian Islands Deepwater Shrimp and Precious Coral Fisheries

## Summary

NMFS proposes to implement annual catch limits (ACL) and accountability measures (AM) for main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) deepwater shrimp and precious coral for each fishing year in the time period between 2022 and 2025. As a post-season AM, if NMFS determines that the most recent three-year average total catch exceeded an ACL in a fishing year, we would reduce the ACL for the following fishing year by the amount of the overage. This proposed rule supports the long-term sustainability of MHI deepwater shrimp and precious coral.
