## Summary

NMFS announces the approval of three fishery management plan (FMP) amendments: Amendment 19 to the FMP for Coastal Pelagic Species (CPS FMP), Amendment 7 to the FMP for the West Coast Highly Migratory Species (HMS FMP), and Amendment 22 to the FMP for Pacific Coast Salmon Fisheries (Salmon FMP) (collectively Amendments). These Amendments modify language in the CPS, HMS, and Salmon FMPs to more clearly describe and align the FMPs with the way bycatch is currently reported in the fisheries managed by the Council. These Amendments ensure conformance with national guidance for compliance with the standardized bycatch reporting methodology (SBRM) requirement in the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA).
