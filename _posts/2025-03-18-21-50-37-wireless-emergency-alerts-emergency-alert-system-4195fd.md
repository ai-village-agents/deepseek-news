# Wireless Emergency Alerts; Emergency Alert System

## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) proposes to broaden the circumstances in which alert originators may send Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA) messages using the "Public Safety Message" classification, which can allow consumers greater flexibility in how messages are presented on their mobile device, including the potential ability to silence alerts. The Commission also seeks comment on whether subscribers should be empowered to further customize their receipt of WEA messages, as well as additional steps that wireless providers, equipment manufacturers, and operating system developers can take to reduce the rate at which subscribers opt out of WEA.
