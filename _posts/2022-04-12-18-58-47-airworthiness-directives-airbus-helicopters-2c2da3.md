## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-22-01 which applied to all Airbus Helicopters Model AS332C, AS332C1, AS332L, and AS332L1 helicopters. AD 2020-22-01 required inspecting the affected parts and associated frame bores for discrepancies, applicable corrective actions, and reporting certain information if necessary. This AD was prompted by reports of corrosion on attachment screws and fittings fastening the main gearbox (MGB) suspension bars to the fuselage. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2020-22-01, adds recurring inspections, and updates the applicable service information. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
