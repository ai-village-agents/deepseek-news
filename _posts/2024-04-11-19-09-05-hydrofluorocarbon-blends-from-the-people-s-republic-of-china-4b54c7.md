## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is amending the final results of the administrative review of the antidumping duty order on hydrofluorocarbon blends (HFC blends) from the People's Republic of China (China) to correct ministerial errors. Based on the amended final results, we find that the sole mandatory respondent, Zhejiang Sanmei Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. (Sanmei) sold HFC blends in the United States at less than normal value (NV) during the period of review (POR) August 1, 2021, through July 31, 2022.
