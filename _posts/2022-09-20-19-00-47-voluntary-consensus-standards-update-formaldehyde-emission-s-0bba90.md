## Summary

On March 29, 2022, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed to update of the incorporation by reference of several voluntary consensus standards in the Agency's formaldehyde standards for composite wood products regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Two additional voluntary consensus standards that are incorporated by reference in the existing regulations were updated by the issuing standards organization after the public comment period for the March 29, 2022, proposed rule ended. EPA is now proposing to update the incorporation by reference of the two additional voluntary consensus standards in the formaldehyde standards for composite wood products regulations.
