## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-1A10 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report indicating that during installation, a fuel pipe bracket assembly on the intermediate rib in the center fuel tank was mislocated, resulting in an offset between the fitting assembly and the refuel/defuel tube assembly. This proposed AD would require modification of the fuel pipe bracket assembly, including all related investigative actions and corrective actions, if necessary; and performing an operational test of the refuel and defuel system. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
