## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is making an interim final determination that the California Air Resources Board (CARB) has submitted a revised rule on behalf of the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) that corrects deficiencies in its Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) state implementation plan (SIP) provisions concerning ozone nonattainment requirements for controlling volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) from refinery flares. This determination is based on a proposed approval, published elsewhere in this Federal Register, of SCAQMD Rule 1118 regulating that source category. The effect of this interim final determination is that the imposition of sanctions that were triggered by a previous disapproval by the EPA in 2022 is now deferred. If the EPA finalizes its approval of SCAQMD's submission, relief from these sanctions will become permanent.
