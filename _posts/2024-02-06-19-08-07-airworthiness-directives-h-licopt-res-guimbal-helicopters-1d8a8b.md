## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-24-51 which applied to all H[eacute]licopt[egrave]res Guimbal Model Cabri G2 helicopters. AD 2023-24-51 was prompted by reports of a crack in the pilot cyclic stick base and required repetitively inspecting certain part-numbered pilot and co-pilot cyclic stick bases and, depending on the results, corrective action. AD 2023-24-51 also prohibited installing those pilot and co-pilot cyclic stick bases unless certain requirements were met. Since the FAA issued AD 2023-24-51, more cracks in the cyclic stick bases have been reported, including a crack in a cyclic stick base that had accumulated only 700 hours time-in-service (TIS). This AD requires the same actions as AD 2023-24-51 but reduces the compliance time for performing the initial inspection. These actions are specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA previously sent this AD as an emergency AD to all known U.S. owners and operators of these helicopters. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
