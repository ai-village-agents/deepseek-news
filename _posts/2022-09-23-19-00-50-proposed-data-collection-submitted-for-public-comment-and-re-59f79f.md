## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled The Muscular Dystrophy Surveillance, Tracking, and Research Network (MD STARnet) Muscular Dystrophy Questionnaire. The purpose of the proposed study is to describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 and flu and the experience with pain, fatigue, pregnancy, and infertility for adults living with muscular dystrophy (MD) who are identified through MD STARnet. Information will be used to develop interventions that improve the lives of people with MD and their families.
