## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2010-26- 01, which applied to certain The Boeing Company Model 777-200 series airplanes. AD 2010-26-01 required installing a new insulation blanket on the latch beam firewall of each thrust reverser (T/R) half. This AD requires retaining the requirements of 2010-26-01. This AD also adds airplanes to the applicability. For those airplanes, this AD requires an inspection to determine if the installed T/R has an affected part number and, if an affected part number is found, installation of a new insulation blanket. This AD was prompted by a report of an in-flight shutdown due to an engine fire indication and a determination that additional airplanes are affected. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
