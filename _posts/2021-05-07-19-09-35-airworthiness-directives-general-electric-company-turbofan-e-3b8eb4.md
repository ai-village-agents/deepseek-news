# Airworthiness Directives; General Electric Company Turbofan Engines

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all General Electric Company GE90-110B1 and GE90-115B model turbofan engines. This proposed AD was prompted by an in-service occurrence of loss of engine thrust control resulting in uncommanded high thrust. This proposed AD would require initial and repetitive replacement of the full authority digital engine control (FADEC) integrated circuit (MN4) microprocessor. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
