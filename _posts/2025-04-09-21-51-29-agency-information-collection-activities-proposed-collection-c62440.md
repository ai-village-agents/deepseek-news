## Summary

We are proposing to request an extension from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) of two currently approved information collections. The first information collection is used by former Federal civilian employees or other authorized individuals to request information from or copies of documents in Official Personnel Files (OPF) or Employee Medical Files (EMF). The second information collection is used to connect veterans and Schedule A-eligible applicants with an opportunity for noncompetitive employment. Information will be collected from people who are interested in these opportunities to consider them for the positions and match them with possible jobs. The collection includes approval of a form, NARA Employment Interest Questionnaire, NA Form 3102. We invite you to comment on these information collections up for renewal.
