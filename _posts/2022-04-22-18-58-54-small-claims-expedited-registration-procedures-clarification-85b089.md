## Summary

The U.S. Copyright Office is amending its regulations to clarify the rules governing the expedited registration option under the Copyright Alternative in Small-Claims Enforcement Act of 2020. The amendment clarifies that when a Copyright Claims Board proceeding cannot continue because a registration is still pending, the Board may hold proceedings in abeyance at any point before a final determination is issued. The rule also describes the process for the Board to receive registration certificates when they are issued while a proceeding is pending, allows parties to request expedited registration before a proceeding becomes active, and corrects non-substantive typographical errors.
