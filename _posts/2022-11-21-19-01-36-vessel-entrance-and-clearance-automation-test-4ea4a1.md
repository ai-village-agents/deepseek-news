## Summary

This document announces that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will conduct the Vessel Entrance and Clearance Automation Test. This test will allow participants to submit certain vessel entry and clearance data and requests to CBP electronically through the Vessel Entrance and Clearance System (VECS), instead of submitting paper forms, as currently required by CBP regulations. Specifically, this test will allow participants to submit the data required on CBP Forms 26, 226, 1300, 1302, 1303, 1304, and 3171 electronically through VECS prior to arrival or departure from designated ports. This notice describes the test, sets forth the eligibility requirements for participation, and invites public comment on any aspect of the test.
