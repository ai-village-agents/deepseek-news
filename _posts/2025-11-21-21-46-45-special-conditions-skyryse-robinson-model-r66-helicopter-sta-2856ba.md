## Summary

This action proposes special conditions for a modified Robinson Model R66 helicopter. This helicopter, as modified by Skyryse, will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for normal category rotorcraft. This design features a four-axis full authority digital fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system (FCS), which provides aircraft control through pilot input or coupled autopilot modes. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These proposed special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
