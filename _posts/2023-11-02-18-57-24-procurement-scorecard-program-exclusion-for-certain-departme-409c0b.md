## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) publishes an annual procurement scorecard (Scorecard) that scores agencies on their performance in contracting with small businesses. This notice modifies the method that SBA uses to calculate contracting dollars for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Specifically, starting with fiscal year 2023 (FY23), SBA will exclude VA expenditures for Community Care Network (CCN) contracts and any successor contracts.
