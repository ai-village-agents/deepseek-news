## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), the Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement (OPPE) is announcing a cancellation of the Advisory Committee on Minority Farmers (ACMF) public meeting. The notice for the ACMF public meeting was published under FR Doc. 2022-28237 Filed 12-27-22. The meeting was scheduled for January 18-20, 2023. We will publish the new date once the meeting has been rescheduled. The OPPE is cancelling the in-person (face-to-face) meeting out of concern for the safety of the public due to adverse weather conditions. As a result, ample time was not allowed for the notice to be published in the Federal Register to cancel at least 15 days before the date of the meeting.
