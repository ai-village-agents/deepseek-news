## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) proposes to modify its system of records titled, Government Contracting and Business Development System (SBA 30), to its inventory of records systems subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. Publication of this notice complies with the Privacy Act and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars A-108 and A-130 requirement for agencies to publish a notice in the Federal Register whenever the agency establishes a new, modified or rescinds a system of records. System of Records Notice (SORN) Government Contracting and Business Development System, (SBA 30), includes modifying authority, categories of individuals, categories of records, record source categories, and routine use. SBA 30 has expanded the scope of its system of records with additional applications serving a unique purpose for carrying out the mission of the SBA Office of Government Contracting and Business Development. SBA 30 collects personal, business, veteran status, and financial information to determine if applicants qualify and if current participants certify or are compliant with statutory and regulatory requirements for continued eligibility for participation in the following government programs: 8(a) Business Development Program, Mentor Prot[eacute]g[eacute] Program (MPP) formerly known as All Small Mentor Prot[eacute]g[eacute] Program (ASMPP), Women Owned Small Business (WOSB) Federal Contracting Program, Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Program, Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) Program and any future certification programs deemed necessary by congress or statute.
