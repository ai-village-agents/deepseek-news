## Summary

In this document, the Commission adopts rules to implement the TRACED Act and require voice service providers to better police their networks. Specifically, the Commission requires voice service providers to meet certain affirmative obligations and to better police their networks against illegal calls. Second, the Commission expands its existing call blocking safe harbor to cover network-based blocking of certain calls that are highly likely to be illegal. Third, the Commission adopts rules to provide greater transparency and ensure that both callers and consumers can better identify blocked calls and ensure those that are wanted are un-blocked, consistent with the TRACED Act. Finally, the Commission broadens its point-of-contact requirement to cover caller ID authentication concerns under the TRACED Act.
