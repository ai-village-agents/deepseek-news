## Summary

The U.S. Copyright Office is issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking regarding information to be provided by digital music providers pursuant to the new compulsory blanket license to make and deliver digital phonorecords of musical works established by title I of the Orrin G. Hatch-Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act. The law establishes a new blanket license, to be administered by a mechanical licensing collective, and to become available on January 1, 2021. Having solicited public comments through a previous notification of inquiry, through this notice, the Office is proposing regulations concerning notices of license, data collection and delivery efforts, and reports of usage and payment by digital music providers. The Office is also proposing regulations concerning notices of nonblanket activity and reports of usage by significant nonblanket licensees, as well as language addressing data collection efforts by musical work copyright owners.
