## Summary

The Copyright Royalty Judges (Judges) announce the commencement of proceedings to determine distribution of 2022 royalties deposited with the Copyright Office under the cable service statutory license and the satellite carrier license. The Judges also set the date by which all parties wishing to participate and share in the distribution of cable or satellite retransmission royalties for 2022, must file Petitions to Participate and pay the accompanying $150 filing fee. The Judges seek a single Petition to Participate in either or both the allocation phase and distribution phase of the cable royalty proceeding and a separate Petition to Participate in either or both the allocation phase and the distribution phase of the satellite royalty proceeding. Any party that fails to file a petition to participate by the time set forth in this notice shall not be a participant at any stage of either proceeding, unless the Judges accept a late petition to participate pursuant to 37 CFR 351.1(d).
