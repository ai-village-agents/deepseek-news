## Summary

In accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), the OCC, the Board, and the FDIC (the agencies) may not conduct or sponsor, and the respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. On October 4, 2019, the agencies, under the auspices of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), requested public comment for 60 days on a proposal to revise and extend the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Reports) (FFIEC 031, FFIEC 041, and FFIEC 051) and the Regulatory Capital Reporting for Institutions Subject to the Advanced Capital Adequacy Framework (FFIEC 101), which are currently approved collections of information. The comment period for the October 2019 notice ended on December 3, 2019. As described in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section, after considering the comments received on the proposal, the agencies are proceeding with the proposed revisions to the reporting forms and instructions for the Call Reports and the FFIEC 101 (except for the reporting changes arising from the proposed total loss absorbing capacity holdings rule that has not yet been finalized), but with certain modifications. In general, the modifications relate to the disclosure of an institution's election of the community bank leverage ratio framework, a change in the scope of the FFIEC 031 Call Report, and the reporting of home equity lines of credit that convert from revolving to non-revolving status. The reporting revisions that implement various changes to the agencies' capital rule would take effect in the same quarters as the effective dates of the capital rule changes, i.e., primarily as of the March 31 and June 30, 2020, report dates. Call Report revisions applicable to operating lease liabilities and home equity lines of credit would take effect in the first quarter of 2020 and 2021, respectively. In addition, the agencies are giving notice they are sending the collections to OMB for review.
