## Summary

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is proposing to prohibit covered financial institutions from charging fees, such as nonsufficient funds fees, when consumers initiate payment transactions that are instantaneously declined. Charging such fees would constitute an abusive practice under the Consumer Financial Protection Act's prohibition on unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices.
