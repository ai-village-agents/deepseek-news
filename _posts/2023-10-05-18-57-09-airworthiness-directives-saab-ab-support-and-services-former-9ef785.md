## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Saab AB, Support and Services Model SAAB 2000 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a review of the anti-skid system revealed the possibility of inadvertently connecting the inboard harness to the outboard channel (and vice versa) of the wheel speed transducers in the main landing gear (MLG) wheel axles. This proposed AD would require installing color markings on the harnesses and the wheel axles, to ensure proper installation and connection of the anti-skid harnesses, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
