## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model EC 130 B4 and EC 130 T2 helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of heavy damage on the fenestron due to the loss of the tail rotor (TR) blade, which broke at the TR hub tension- torsion bar (tension-torsion bar). This AD requires inspecting the tension-torsion bar and, depending on the inspection results, replacing the part with a serviceable part. This AD also prohibits performing maintenance using certain maintenance manuals. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
