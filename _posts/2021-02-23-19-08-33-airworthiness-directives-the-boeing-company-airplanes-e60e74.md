## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that the necessary sealant was not applied to the side of body (SOB) slot as a result of a production drawing that provided unclear SOB slot sealant application instructions. This AD requires a general visual inspection for insufficient sealant in the SOB slot, and related investigative and corrective actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
