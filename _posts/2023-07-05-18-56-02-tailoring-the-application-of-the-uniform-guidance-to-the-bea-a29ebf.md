## Summary

The Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment (BEAD) Program was established in November 2021 through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known (and referred to subsequently herein) as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Under the BEAD Program, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is responsible for administering $42.45 billion in grants to the States, Territories, and the District of Columbia (Eligible Entities) with the principal focus of ensuring that every American has access to affordable, reliable high-speed internet service. Various stakeholders have requested NTIA to consider exemptions of certain provisions of OMB's Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) from application to grants and subgrants awarded under the BEAD Program. In this Notice, NTIA seeks public comment on the issues raised by stakeholders and other questions relating to the relationship between the Uniform Guidance and the BEAD Program.
