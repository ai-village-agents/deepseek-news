## Summary

In a notice of final disposition published in the Federal Register on March 21, 2023, FMCSA announced its decision to exempt 15 individuals from the requirement in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) that interstate commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers have "no established medical history or clinical diagnosis of epilepsy or any other condition which is likely to cause loss of consciousness or any loss of ability to control a CMV." The exemptions enable these individuals who have had one or more seizures and are taking anti-seizure medication to operate CMVs in interstate commerce. The notice was inadvertently published indicating the incorrect expiration date of the exemptions granted. This notice corrects that error.
