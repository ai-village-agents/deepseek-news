## Summary

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is considering removing all 49 Division 1.1 explosive chemicals of interest from Appendix A of the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) regulations. Currently, both CISA and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) regulate facilities possessing these chemicals for security concerns. Removing these chemicals of interest from coverage under CFATS would reduce regulatory requirements for facilities currently covered by both CFATS and ATF's regulatory frameworks and relieve compliance burdens for a small number of affected facilities.
