## Summary

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) invites public comment on one currently-approved Information Collection Request (ICR), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number 1652-0056, abstracted below, that we will submit to OMB for an extension in compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). On July 29, 2022, OMB approved TSA's request for an emergency revision of this collection to address the ongoing cybersecurity threat to pipeline systems and associated infrastructure. TSA is now seeking to renew the collection, which expires on January 31, 2023, with incorporation of the subject of the emergency revision. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected burden. The collection allows TSA to assess the current security practices in the pipeline industry through TSA's Pipeline Corporate Security Review (PCSR) program and allows for the continued institution of mandatory cybersecurity requirements under the TSA Security Directive (SD) Pipeline 2021-02 series. The PCSR program is part of the larger domain awareness, prevention, and protection program supporting TSA's and the Department of Homeland Security's missions. The updated ICR reflects changes to collection requirements based on TSA's update to the TSA SD 2021-02 series, released on July 21, 2022.
