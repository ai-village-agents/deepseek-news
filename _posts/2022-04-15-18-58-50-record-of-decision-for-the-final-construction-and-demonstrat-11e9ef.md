## Summary

The DoD, acting through the Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO), is issuing this Record of Decision (ROD) for the Final Construction and Demonstration of a Prototype Mobile Microreactor Environmental Impact Statement (Final EIS). SCO has decided to implement the Proposed Action (the preferred alternative) as described in the Final EIS. The Proposed Action is to fabricate the prototype mobile microreactor and reactor fuel at existing off-site commercial facilities and demonstrate the microreactor at the Department of Energy's (DOE's) Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Site. The analysis in the EIS demonstrates that implementing the Proposed Action would have small environmental consequences that would not require mitigation outside of practices required by regulations, permits, or agreements.
