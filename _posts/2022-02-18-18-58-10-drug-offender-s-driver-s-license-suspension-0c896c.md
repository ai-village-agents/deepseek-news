## Summary

FHWA proposes to amend its regulations governing each State's certification of whether they choose to enact and enforce drug offender's driver's license requirements or choose to oppose enacting or enforcing the drug offender's driver's license requirement. The regulations apply to each State and specify the steps that States must take to avoid the withholding of Federal-aid highway funds for noncompliance with the certification requirements. Highway Safety is the top priority of both DOT and FHWA. The changes that FHWA has proposed to the regulations will not negatively impact safety, efforts to combat substance abuse, or the substantive protections provided by the State certification requirements. Rather, they simply update the regulations to align with the wording of relevant statutes, increase clarity, and reduce administrative burden on States. Reducing fatalities and serious injuries resulting from impairment will continue to be a top priority of the Department and FHWA.
