## Summary

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended, authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to grant approval to states to operate their underground storage tank (UST) programs in lieu of the Federal program. The Commonwealth of Kentucky (Commonwealth or State) applied to the EPA for final approval to its UST Program on October 7, 2019, and on September 16, 2020, the EPA published a final determination and approval of the Commonwealth's UST Program. This action proposes to codify the EPA's prior approval of the Commonwealth's UST Program and to incorporate by reference approved provisions of the Commonwealth's statutes and regulations.
