## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation (Gulfstream) Model GV and GV-SP airplanes. This AD was prompted by the omission of a life limit in the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the maintenance manual for a certain main landing gear (MLG) trunnion pin. This AD requires revising the ALS of the existing instructions for continued airworthiness (ICA) or inspection program for the airplane to establish a life limit for the affected MLG trunnion pin. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
