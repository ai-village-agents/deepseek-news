## Summary

This action proposes to amend restricted areas R-3004A, R- 3004B, and R-3004C at U.S. Army Installation Management Command (IMCOM) Fort Gordon, GA. The proposed amended airspace would align the lateral boundaries to encompass the majority of the training complex and amend the vertical divisions for better management to activate only the airspace required to support the Army's training. It would also remove restrictions on aircraft operations on weekends, flight above 12,000 feet above ground level (AGL), and the requirement that weather minima exceed standard Visual Flight Rules (VFR) criteria.
