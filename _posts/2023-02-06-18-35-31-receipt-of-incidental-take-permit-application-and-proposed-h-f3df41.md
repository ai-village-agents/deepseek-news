## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, have received an application from Great Pathfinder Wind LLC (applicant), for an incidental take permit (ITP) under the Endangered Species Act. If approved, the ITP would be for a 6-year period and would authorize the incidental take of two endangered species, the Indiana bat and the northern long-eared bat. The applicant has prepared a habitat conservation plan (HCP) in support of their application. We have made a preliminary determination that the HCP and permit application are eligible for categorical exclusion under the National Environmental Policy Act. We invite comments from the public and Federal, Tribal, State, and local governments.
