## Summary

Through this notification, HUD announces changes to the Demonstration to Assess the National Standards for the Physical Inspection of Real Estate and Associated Protocols (NSPIRE). This demonstration allows HUD to test the NSPIRE standards and protocols as the means for assessing the physical conditions of HUD-assisted and HUD-insured housing. Through this notification, HUD is informing Demonstration participants who are subject to HUD's Multifamily Housing program that Demonstration participants will receive an inspection of record through the NSPIRE demonstration unless they opt out of the demonstration, in which case they will receive an inspection of record through the Uniform Physical Condition Standards (UPCS). HUD is also revising this demonstration so that the demonstration ends on the effective date of the NSPIRE final rule.
