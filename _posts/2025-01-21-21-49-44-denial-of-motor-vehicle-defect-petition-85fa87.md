## Summary

This notice sets forth the reasons for the denial of defect petition DP22-002, submitted on April 29, 2022, by Mr. Sergio Betancourt (the petitioner) to NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation (ODI). The petition requests that the Agency investigate alleged "wrong-sized wrist pins" in Mercedes-Benz vehicles equipped with the M274 engine (including the Metris minivan, GLC300, and C300). After conducting a technical review of the petitioner's submissions, information provided by Mercedes-Benz in response to the Agency's Information Request, and data within its own files, NHTSA has concluded that there is insufficient evidence to warrant further action at this time. Accordingly, the Agency has denied the petition.
