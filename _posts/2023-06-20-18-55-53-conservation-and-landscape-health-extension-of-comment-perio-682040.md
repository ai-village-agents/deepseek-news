## Summary

On April 3, 2023, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) published in the Federal Register a proposed rule that, pursuant to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), as amended, and other relevant authorities, would advance the BLM's mission to manage the public lands for multiple use and sustained yield by prioritizing the health and resilience of ecosystems across those lands. To ensure that health and resilience, the proposed rule provides that the BLM will protect intact landscapes, restore degraded habitat, and make wise management decisions based on science and data. The BLM has determined that it is appropriate to extend the comment period for the docket until July 5, 2023, to allow for additional public comment.
