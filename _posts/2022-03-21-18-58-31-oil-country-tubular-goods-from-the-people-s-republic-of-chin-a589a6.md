## Summary

On February 14, 2022, the Department of Commerce (Commerce) published the initiation and preliminary results of the changed circumstances reviews of the antidumping and countervailing duty orders on oil country tubular goods (OCTG) from the People's Republic of China (China). For these final results, Commerce continues to find that HLDS (B) Steel Sdn Bhd (HLDS (B)) and HLD Clark Steel Pipe Co., Inc. (HLD Clark) (collectively, HLD companies) are eligible to participate in a certification process because the HLD companies have demonstrated that they can identify OCTG that they produced in either Brunei or the Philippines using non-Chinese hot-rolled steel.
