# Airworthiness Directives; Pratt & Whitney Canada Corp. Turboshaft Engines

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Pratt & Whitney Canada Corp. (P&WC) PW210A and PW210S model turboshaft engines. This proposed AD was prompted by a report from the manufacturer that the Automated Damage Tracking System (ADTS) may under-count the number of cycles accrued by the impeller and the high- pressure compressor (HPC) rotor. The impeller and HPC rotor are both life-limited components and exceeding their published life limits could result in the failure of these components. This proposed AD would require the use of the manual low-cycle fatigue (LCF) counting method in place of the ADTS counting method to determine the number of cycles accrued by the impeller and HPC rotor. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
