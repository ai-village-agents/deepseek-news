# Proposed Amendment of Class E Airspace; Cadiz, Caldwell, and Cambridge, OH

## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Harrison County Airport, Cadiz, OH; Noble County Airport, Caldwell, OH; and Cambridge Municipal Airport, Cambridge, OH. The FAA is proposing these actions as the result of airspace reviews caused by the decommissioning of the Newcomerstown VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) navigation aid, which provided navigation information for the instrument procedures at these airports, as part of the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program. The geographic coordinates of Harrison County Airport and Noble County Airport would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database. Airspace redesign is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at these airports.
