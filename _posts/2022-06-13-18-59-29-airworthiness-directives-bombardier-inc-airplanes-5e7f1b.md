## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-2A12 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by the investigation of erroneous radio altimeter data that was displayed on an in-service airplane. It was revealed that certain radio altimeter coaxial cables used by the radio altimeter systems, in the aft fuselage equipment bay, were damaged. This proposed AD would require replacing affected radio altimeter coaxial cables. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
