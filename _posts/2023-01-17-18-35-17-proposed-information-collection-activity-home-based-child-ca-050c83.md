## Summary

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation (OPRE) is proposing a new primary data collection to examine the experiences, strengths, resources, and strategies used by home-based child care providers to serve and support equitable outcomes for children and families. The Home-Based Child Care Practices and Experiences study will explore the experiences of a particular group of home-based child care providers who are legally exempt from state licensing or other state regulations that apply to non-custodial care of children in the provider's own home; these providers are commonly referred to as family, friend, and neighbor providers.
