## Summary

As part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, FinCEN invites comment on a renewal, without change, of existing information collection requirements relating to reports of transactions in currency. Under Bank Secrecy Act regulations, financial institutions are required to report transactions in currency of more than $10,000 using FinCEN Form 112 (the currency transaction report, or CTR). This request for comments is made pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA).
