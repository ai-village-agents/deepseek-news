## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (AHD) Model MBB-BK 117 C-2 helicopters. This AD was prompted by reports of excessively worn bolts that connect the cardan-pivot joint with the piston rod of the tail rotor actuator (TRA) assembly. This AD requires repetitively inspecting certain TRA assemblies, and depending on the results, replacing or repairing parts, or accomplishing additional inspections. This AD also prohibits installing an affected TRA assembly unless it passes required inspections. Lastly, this AD provides terminating actions for certain inspections, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
