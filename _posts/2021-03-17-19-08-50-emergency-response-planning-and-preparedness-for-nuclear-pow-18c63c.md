## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing for public comment a draft regulatory guide (DG), DG-1357, "Emergency Response Planning and Preparedness for Nuclear Power Reactors." This DG is proposed Revision 6 of Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.101, "Emergency Response Planning and Preparedness for Nuclear Power Reactors." This proposed revision endorses Revision 0 of the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) white paper, "Implementing a 24-Month Frequency for Emergency Preparedness Program Reviews," issued November 2019. In addition, this proposed revision includes guidance found in previous revisions of RG 1.101, updated NRC guidance documents, and other documents previously endorsed by the NRC to consolidate the list of these guidance documents into a single revision of the RG.
