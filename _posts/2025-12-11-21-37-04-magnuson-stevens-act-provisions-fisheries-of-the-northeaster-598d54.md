## Summary

NMFS approves and implements 2025-2027 specifications and river herring and shad catch caps for the Atlantic herring fishery, as recommended by the New England Fishery Management Council. This action also updates the target rebuilding date for Atlantic herring. This action is necessary to respond to updated scientific information from a 2024 Atlantic herring management track assessment and to achieve the objectives of the Atlantic Herring Fishery Management Plan, including preventing overfishing, helping rebuild an overfished stock, and achieving optimum yield on a continuing basis.
