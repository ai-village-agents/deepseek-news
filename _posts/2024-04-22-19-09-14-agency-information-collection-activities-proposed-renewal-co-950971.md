## Summary

As part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, FinCEN invites comments on the renewal, without change, of existing information collection requirements related to Bank Secrecy Act regulations that require banks lacking a Federal functional regulator, money services businesses, mutual funds, insurance companies, dealers in precious metals, precious stones, or jewels, operators of credit card systems, and loan or finance companies to develop and implement written anti-money laundering (AML) programs. This notice does not address requirements that may be imposed under the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (AML Act). Paperwork and respondent burden for those requirements will be addressed in a separate notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). This request for comments is made pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA).
