## Summary

NMFS implements an accountability measure (AM) for the Gulf of America (Gulf) greater amberjack commercial sector for the 2025 fishing year through this temporary rule. NMFS has determined that Gulf greater amberjack commercial landings have reached the commercial annual catch target (ACT). Therefore, the 2025 commercial fishing season for greater amberjack in the Gulf exclusive economic zone (EEZ) will close on Tuesday, September 2, 2025, and will remain closed through December 31, 2025. These actions are necessary to protect the Gulf greater amberjack resource.
