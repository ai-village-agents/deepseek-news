## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, announce the availability of a draft habitat conservation plan (HCP) and draft categorical exclusion for activities associated with continued operation and maintenance of Big Tujunga Dam and a spillway improvement project. Los Angeles County Department of Public Works (applicant) developed a draft HCP as part of their application for an incidental take permit (ITP) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power would be a participating agency. The Service prepared a draft low-effect screening form and environmental action statement in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to evaluate the potential effects to the natural and human environment resulting from issuing an ITP to the applicant. We invite public comment on these documents.
