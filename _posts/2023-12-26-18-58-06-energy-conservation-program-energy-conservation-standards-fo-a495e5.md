## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to establish enforcement procedures for its energy conservation standards for manufactured housing. DOE recently amended the compliance date for these standards in a final rule to delay compliance. DOE delayed the compliance date to allow DOE more time for this rulemaking to establish enforcement procedures that provide clarity for manufacturers and other stakeholders regarding DOE's expectations of manufacturers and DOE's plans for enforcing the standards.
