## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to modify the Longview anchorage by reducing its size to allow completion of the Longview Channel realignment project. This action is necessary to provide commercial vessels with the space needed to safely transit the navigational channel by maximizing the available height clearance of the Lewis and Clark bridge in Longview, WA. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
