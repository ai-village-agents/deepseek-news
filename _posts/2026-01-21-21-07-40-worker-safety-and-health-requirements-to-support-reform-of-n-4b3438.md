## Summary

The Department of Energy (DOE or the Department) proposes to amend its regulations for worker safety and health to expedite the review, approval, and deployment of advanced reactors under DOE's jurisdiction including qualified test reactors in DOE's reactor pilot program, consistent with a recent Executive order. The revisions would ensure that DOE's worker safety and health program continues to protect workers, while incorporating lessons learned from decades of operating experience and fostering nuclear innovation and technologies to the benefit of the United States. Additionally, the proposed rule would make minor updates to these regulations to improve clarity.
