## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Hamilton Sundstrand Corporation (Hamilton Sundstrand) Model 14SF-7, 14SF-15, and 14SF-23 propellers. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of an auxiliary motor and pump failing to feather a propeller in flight. This proposed AD would require replacement of a certain auxiliary motor and pump. This proposed AD would also prohibit installation of a certain auxiliary motor and pump on any propeller. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
