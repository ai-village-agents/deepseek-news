## Summary

This final rule amends the uniform procedures implementing the State Highway Safety Grant Program to waive, for Fiscal Year (FY) 2025, the requirement that targets for the common performance measures be identical to targets in the State Highway Safety Improvement Program. This final rule makes a corresponding change to a similar requirement in the FHWA's performance management regulation.
