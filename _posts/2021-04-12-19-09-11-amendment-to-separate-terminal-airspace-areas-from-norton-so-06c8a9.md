# Amendment To Separate Terminal Airspace Areas From Norton Sound Low, Woody Island Low, Control 1234L, and Control 1487L Offshore Airspace Areas; Alaska

## Summary

This action amends the following Offshore Airspace Areas in Alaska: Norton Sound Low, Woody Island Low, Control 1234L, and Control 1487L. The FAA found an error with the Offshore Airspace Legal Descriptions containing airspace descriptions not related to the need to apply IFR en route Air Traffic Control services in international airspace. This action corrects that error by removing terminal airspace, airspace associated with geographic coordinates, and airspace associated with NAVAIDs from the Offshore Airspace legal descriptions.
