## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) finds that revocation of the countervailing duty (CVD) order on certain cold-drawn mechanical tubing of carbon and alloy steel (cold-drawn mechanical tubing) from India would be likely to lead to the continuation or recurrence of countervailable subsidies at the levels indicated in the "Final Results of Sunset Review" section of this notice.
