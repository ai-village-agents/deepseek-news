## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing a final finding of no significant impact (FONSI) and accompanying supplement to the NRC staff's environmental assessment (EA) for the license renewal of the Crow Butte Resources, Inc. (CBR) in situ uranium recovery (ISR) facility located Dawes County, Nebraska. Based on the analysis in the EA supplement, the NRC staff has concluded that there will be no significant impacts to cultural resources from the renewal of CBR's license and, therefore, a FONSI remains appropriate.
