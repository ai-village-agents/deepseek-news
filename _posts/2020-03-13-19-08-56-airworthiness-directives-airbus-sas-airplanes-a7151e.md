## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A330-200 Freighter, A330-200, A330-300, A340-200, and A340-300 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports that elevator skin panels were found disbonded as a result of water ingress. This AD requires repetitive detailed inspections of skin panels on both elevators, and corrective actions if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
