## Summary

We, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce receipt of an application from Angie Harbin, Director--Natural Resources, Rincon Consultants, Inc., on behalf of Comstock Homes (applicant) for an incidental take permit (ITP) under the Endangered Species Act. The applicant requests the ITP to take the federally listed coastal California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica californica) incidental to residential development in the City of Moorpark, in Ventura County, California. We request public comment on the application, which includes the applicant's proposed habitat conservation plan (HCP), and on the Service's preliminary determination that the proposed permitting action may be eligible for a categorical exclusion pursuant to the Council on Environmental Quality's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations, the Department of the Interior's (DOI) NEPA regulations, and the DOI Departmental Manual. To make this preliminary determination, we prepared a low-effect screening form. The HCP and low-effect screening form are available for public review. We invite comment from the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies.
