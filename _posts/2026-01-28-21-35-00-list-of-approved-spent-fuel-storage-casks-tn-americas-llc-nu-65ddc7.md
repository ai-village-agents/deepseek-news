## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its spent fuel storage regulations by revising the TN Americas LLC, NUHOMS[supreg] Extended Optimized Storage (EOS) Dry Spent Fuel Storage System listing within the "List of approved spent fuel storage casks" to include Amendment No. 5 to Certificate of Compliance (CoC) No. 1042. Amendment No. 5 revises the CoC to add a new heat load zone configuration (HLZC) for the EOS-37PTH canister, increasing the maximum heat load to 54 kW per dry shielded canister (DSC) for storage in the EOS-Horizontal Storage Module (HSM) and transfer using EOS-Transfer Casks (TC)125/135; clarifies acceptance criteria for minor surface imperfections on high strength low-alloy (HSLA) basket plates in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR); and makes editorial updates to the UFSAR and Technical Specification (TS) revisions to align with Amendment No. 4, improve readability, and correct code references.
