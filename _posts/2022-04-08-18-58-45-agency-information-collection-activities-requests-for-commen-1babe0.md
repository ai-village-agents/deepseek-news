## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for a new information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on June 8, 2021. The collection involves entities that voluntarily follow the guidance in FAA Advisory Circular (AC) 120-119, Voluntary Safety Management System (SMS) for Other Regulated Entities Transporting Dangerous Goods by Air, on how to use the SMS principles included in FAA regulations, as a basis to develop and implement a voluntary SMS program and how to submit such a voluntary program to the FAA's Office of Hazardous Materials Safety (AXH) for acceptance. Information received from the first collection will be used to determine consistency with FAA SMS regulations. With the exception of a one-time submission of an implementation plan, the data will not be submitted to the FAA. The records for Safety Policy, Safety Risk Management, and Safety Assurance processes, training, and communications are kept under Safety Promotion and will be kept by the organization and used in its SMS.
