## Summary

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO or Office) amends the rules of practice in patent cases and the rules regarding the representation of others before the USPTO to eliminate provisions regarding voluntary continuing legal education (CLE) certification for registered patent practitioners and individuals granted limited recognition to practice in patent matters before the USPTO. After rules were published on August 3, 2020, providing that registered patent practitioners and persons granted limited recognition to practice in patent matters before the USPTO would be permitted to voluntarily certify completion of CLE to the Director of the Office of Enrollment and Discipline (OED Director) and that the OED Director could publish whether such persons had voluntarily certified, the USPTO indefinitely delayed implementation of the voluntary CLE certification. After receiving and considering stakeholder feedback on the certification process and possible details regarding implementation, the USPTO has determined that it will not implement the voluntary CLE certification program at this time.
