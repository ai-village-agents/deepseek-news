## Summary

On May 19, 2022, HUD published a notice in the Federal Register entitled, "Changes in Certain Office of Healthcare Programs Insurance Premiums." The notice contained a chart showing FHA Office of Health Care Facilities Insurance Premiums by Rate & Category. That chart incorrectly listed current upfront capitalized mortgage insurance premium (MIP) basis points for some of the listed programs. Additionally, the chart contained an incorrect note related to MIPs. Today's notice corrects the chart and associated note in the notice published on May 19, 2022.
