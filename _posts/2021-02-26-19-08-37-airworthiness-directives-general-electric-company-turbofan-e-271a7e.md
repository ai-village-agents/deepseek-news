# Airworthiness Directives; General Electric Company Turbofan Engines

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain General Electric Company (GE) GEnx-2B67, GEnx-2B67/P, and GEnx-2B67B model turbofan engines. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a crack in the lower fuel manifold causing fuel leakage. This proposed AD would require an ultrasonic inspection (USI) or a fluorescent penetrant inspection (FPI) of the lower fuel manifold. Depending on the results of the USI or FPI, this proposed AD would require replacement of the lower fuel manifold with a part eligible for installation. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
