## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC, Commission, or Agency) has modified an existing system of records, FCC/OMD-2, Labor Relations and Employee Performance Files, subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. This action is necessary to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act to publish in the Federal Register notice of the existence and character of records maintained by the Agency. The records in this system contain information on Commission employees that the Human Resources Management (HRM) in the Office of Managing Director (OMD) uses for purposes such as litigation, law enforcement, congressional inquiries, labor organization inquiries, and government- wide program oversight.
