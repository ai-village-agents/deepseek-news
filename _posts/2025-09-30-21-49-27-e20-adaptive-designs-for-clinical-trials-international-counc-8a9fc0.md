The draft guidance is intended to provide a transparent and harmonized set of recommendations for clinical trials with an adaptive design. The draft guidance focuses on principles for the planning, conduct, analysis, and interpretation of clinical trials with an adaptive design that aim to confirm the efficacy and support the benefit-risk assessment of a treatment. The draft guidance emphasizes principles that are critical for ensuring clinical trials produce reliable and interpretable results and that involve specific considerations with use of an adaptive design.
