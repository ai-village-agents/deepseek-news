## Summary

NMFS is opening directed fishing for sablefish with fixed gear managed under the Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) Program and the Community Development Quota (CDQ) Program. The season will open 1200 hours, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), March 20, 2025, and will close 1200 hours, A.l.t., December 7, 2025. This period is the same as the 2025 commercial halibut fishery opening dates adopted by the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC), except the hours are not the same. The IFQ and CDQ halibut season dates are the same as specified by a separate publication in the Federal Register of annual management measures, which should be referenced for the halibut specific open and closure times.
