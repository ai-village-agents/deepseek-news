## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Delaware into Delaware's existing SIP-approved public notice requirements for certain permits authorized under Delaware regulation 1102. The revisions Delaware made to its underlying regulation standardize the public notices requirements across various permits under Delaware regulation 1102 to be consistent with EPA's October 18, 2016 final rule amendments to the notice and comment requirements for Title V, new source review and outer continental shelf (OCS) permit programs. This action is being taken under the Clean Air Act (CAA).
