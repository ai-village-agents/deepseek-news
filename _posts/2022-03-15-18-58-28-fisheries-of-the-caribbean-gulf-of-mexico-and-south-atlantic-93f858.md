## Summary

NMFS implements an accountability measure for the commercial longline component for golden tilefish in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the South Atlantic. Commercial longline landings for golden tilefish are projected to reach the longline component's commercial quota by March 16, 2022. Therefore, NMFS closes the commercial longline component of golden tilefish in the South Atlantic EEZ on March 16, 2022, at 12:01 a.m. local time. This closure is necessary to protect the golden tilefish resource.
