## Summary

With this final rule, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), which it maintains, by revising license requirements for certain cameras, systems, and related components. These revisions will better align controls with technological and commercial developments, such as the items' global commercial availability, while recognizing the cooperative strategic relationship the United States has with our closest allies. In addition to these changes, BIS is adding controls on certain cameras that are not already controlled by either export control classification number (ECCN) 6A003 or 6A203. These new controls are detailed under new ECCN 6A293, which is a classification for temporary controls for which BIS is seeking multilateral agreement.
