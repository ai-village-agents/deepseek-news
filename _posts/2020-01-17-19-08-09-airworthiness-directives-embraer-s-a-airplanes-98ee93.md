## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Embraer S.A. Model ERJ 170 airplanes and Model ERJ 190-100 STD, -100 LR, -100 ECJ, -100 IGW, -200 STD, -200 LR, and -200 IGW airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that certain main landing gear (MLG) aft pintle pins repaired using a sulphamate nickel plating have a life limit that is less than the certified life limit. This proposed AD would require a one-time records review and a general visual inspection (GVI) of the MLG aft pintle pins to determine if certain repairs were done, and replacement of certain MLG aft pintle pins with serviceable MLG aft pintle pins, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) Brazilian AD, which will be incorporated by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
