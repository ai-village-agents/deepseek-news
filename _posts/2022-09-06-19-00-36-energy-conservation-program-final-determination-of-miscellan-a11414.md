## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") has determined that miscellaneous gas products ("MGPs"), which are comprised of decorative hearths and outdoor heaters, qualify as covered products under Part A of Title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended ("EPCA"). DOE has determined that coverage of MGPs is necessary and appropriate to carry out the purposes of EPCA, and that the average U.S. household energy use for MGPs is likely to exceed 100 kilowatt-hours per year.
