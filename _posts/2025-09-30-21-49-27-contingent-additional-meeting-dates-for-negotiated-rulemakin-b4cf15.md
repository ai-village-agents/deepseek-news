## Summary

The Department of Education announced in the Federal Register on July 25, 2025, that it will host a meeting for the RISE Rulemaking Committee from September 29 to October 3, 2025. In this notice, the Department announces the addition of contingent virtual meeting dates of October 15-17, 2025, for the RISE Negotiated Rulemaking Committee in the event of an appropriation lapse that prevents the Committee from meeting in-person at the U.S. Department of Education on October 1-3, 2025. This rulemaking is necessary to implement recent statutory changes to the Title IV, Higher Education Act programs in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Trump signed into law on July 4, 2025, as well as to implement other Administration priorities.
