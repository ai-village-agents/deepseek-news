## Summary

The Coast Guard announces the availability of a Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the proposed replacement of the BNSF Railway Bridge across the Missouri River between Bismarck and Mandan, North Dakota. This was prepared in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and Council on Environmental Quality implementing regulations, and the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). This final EIS evaluates the potential environmental consequences of permitting the replacement of the existing BNSF Railway Bridge across the Missouri River between the cities of Bismarck and Mandan, ND, or the construction of a bridge adjacent to the existing bridge. The applicant proposes to remove the existing structure, which is eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. The Coast Guard analyzed proposed alternatives, through the NEPA and NHPA processes, which included alternatives to construct the new bridge while retaining the existing bridge. The Coast Guard is making the final EIS available to the public on this docket. Section 4.0 of the final EIS identifies the preferred alternative, which is to construct a new bridge with 200-foot spans, and piers 20 feet upstream of the existing bridge, and to remove the existing structure.
