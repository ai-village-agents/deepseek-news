## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Leonardo S.p.a. (Leonardo) Model AB139 and AW139 helicopters. This AD requires removing certain forward facing center seats (seats). This AD was prompted by a design deficiency that affects seats on certain main cabin floor installations. The actions of this AD are intended to address an unsafe condition on these products.
