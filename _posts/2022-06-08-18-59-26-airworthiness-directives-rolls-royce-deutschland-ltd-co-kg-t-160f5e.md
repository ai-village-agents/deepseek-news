## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Trent 7000-72 and Trent 7000- 72C model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by in-service experience showing that certain high-pressure turbine (HPT) blades may prematurely deteriorate to an unacceptable condition when managed in accordance with the inspection intervals in the Time Limits Manual (TLM). This AD requires initial and repetitive on-wing borescope inspections (BSIs) of the HPT blades to detect axial cracking and, depending on the results of the inspections, replacement of the HPT blade set, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference (IBR). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
