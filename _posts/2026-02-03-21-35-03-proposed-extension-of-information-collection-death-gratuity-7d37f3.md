## Summary

The Department of Labor, as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, conducts a pre-clearance request for comment to provide the general public and Federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on proposed collections of information in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This request helps to ensure that: requested data can be provided in the desired format; reporting burden (time and financial resources) is minimized; collection instruments are clearly understood; and the impact of collection requirements on respondents can be properly assessed. Currently, the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, Division of Federal Employees' Compensation, (OWCP/DFEC) is soliciting comments on the information collection for the Death Gratuity, Form CA-40, Designation of a Recipient of the Federal Employees' Compensation Act Death Gratuity Payment under 5 U.S.C. 8102a; CA-41, Claim for Survivor Benefits under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act Section 8102a Death Gratuity; and CA-42, Official Notice of Employees' Death for Purposes of FECA Section 8102a Death Gratuity.
