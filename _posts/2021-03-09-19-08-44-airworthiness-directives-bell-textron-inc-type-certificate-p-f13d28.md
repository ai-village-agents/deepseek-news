## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Bell Textron Inc. (Bell) Model 205B helicopters. This AD was prompted by flight testing and fatigue analysis results. This AD requires reducing the life limit of certain tail rotor (T/R) blades and re- identifying them with a new part number (P/N). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
