# Aviation Maintenance Technician Schools; Withdrawal

**Published:** February 05, 2026 18:59 UTC

## Summary

The FAA is withdrawing a previously published notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that would have modernized and reorganized the required curriculum subjects for certificated Aviation Maintenance Technician Schools (AMTS), relocated course content items from the appendices into each school's operations specifications, and updated curriculum requirements to meet current industry needs. The FAA is also withdrawing the subsequently published supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) that would have expanded the scope of the NPRM to allow competency-based training and satellite training locations and replaced the national passing norms specified in the quality of instruction requirements with a standard pass rate. The FAA is withdrawing these regulatory actions because they have been superseded by the Aircraft Certification, Safety, and Accountability Act.
