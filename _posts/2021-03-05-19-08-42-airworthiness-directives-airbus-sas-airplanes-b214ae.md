## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and A350-1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports that suitable corrosion protection treatment had not been applied to certain areas of the seat track. This AD requires a one-time detailed inspection of the seat tracks between certain frames for suitable corrosion protection or presence of corrosion, and on- condition actions if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
