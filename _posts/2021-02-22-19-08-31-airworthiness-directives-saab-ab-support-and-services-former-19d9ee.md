## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Saab AB, Support and Services Model SAAB 2000 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of inadvertently reversed connections of the outboard and inboard channel harnesses of the wheel speed transducers in the main landing gear (MLG) wheel axles. This AD requires an inspection for correct installation of the MLG anti-skid system harnesses and corrective actions if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
