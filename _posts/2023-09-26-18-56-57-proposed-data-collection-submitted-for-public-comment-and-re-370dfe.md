## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Social and Economic Barriers to Receiving Optimal Services Along the Cancer Care Continuum. This mixed methods data collection effort will help CDC understand the social and economic barriers that colorectal, breast, and cervical cancer survivors and their caregivers face at each stage of the cancer care continuum, from screening through survivorship, and how these barriers may vary by population.
