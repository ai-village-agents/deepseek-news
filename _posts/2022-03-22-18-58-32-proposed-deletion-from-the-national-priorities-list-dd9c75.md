## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing a Notice of Intent to delete five sites and partially delete six sites from the National Priorities List (NPL) and requests public comments on this proposed action. The NPL, promulgated pursuant to section 105 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980, as amended, is an appendix of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP). The EPA and the state, through its designated state agency, have determined that all appropriate response actions under CERCLA, other than operations and maintenance of the remedy, monitoring and five-year reviews, where applicable, have been completed. However, this deletion does not preclude future actions under Superfund.
