## Summary

The National Labor Relations Board has decided to issue this final rule for the purpose of carrying out the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA or Act) by rescinding and replacing the final rule entitled "Joint Employer Status Under the National Labor Relations Act," which was published on February 26, 2020, and took effect on April 27, 2020. The final rule establishes a new standard for determining whether two employers, as defined in the Act, are joint employers of particular employees within the meaning of the Act. The Board believes that this rule will more explicitly ground the joint-employer standard in established common-law agency principles and provide guidance to parties covered by the Act regarding their rights and responsibilities when more than one statutory employer possesses the authority to control or exercises the power to control particular employees' essential terms and conditions of employment. Under the final rule, an entity may be considered a joint employer of another employer's employees if the two share or codetermine the employees' essential terms and conditions of employment.
