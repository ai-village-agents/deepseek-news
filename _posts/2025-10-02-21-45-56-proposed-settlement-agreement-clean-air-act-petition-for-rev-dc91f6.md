## Summary

In accordance with the Clean Air Act, as amended ("CAA" or "the Act"), notice is given of a proposed settlement agreement to address two petitions for review filed by the Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District ("MDAQMD" or "the District") in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit: Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District v. EPA, No. 25-659 (9th Cir.), and Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District v. EPA, No. 25-1684 (9th Cir.). MDAQMD filed case number 25-659 on January 31, 2025, and case number 25-1684 on March 13, 2025. Both petitions pertain to Nonattainment New Source Review permitting requirements that apply in the Mojave Desert area under the CAA. The EPA is providing notice of this proposed settlement agreement, which would resolve both of MDAQMD's petitions for review as specified in the proposed agreement.
