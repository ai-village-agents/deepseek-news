# Airworthiness Directives; Bell Textron Canada Limited Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bell Textron Canada Limited (Bell) Model 407 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a fractured pilot cyclic stick tube and subsequent findings of other pilot cyclic stick tubes with fatigue cracking. This proposed AD would require repetitively inspecting the pilot cyclic stick tube assembly for a crack and, depending on the results, repairing or replacing the pilot cyclic stick tube assembly. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
