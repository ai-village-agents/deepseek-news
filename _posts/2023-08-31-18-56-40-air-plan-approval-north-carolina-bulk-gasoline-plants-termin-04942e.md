## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a final rule in the Federal Register on August 9, 2023, titled "Air Plan Approval; North Carolina; Bulk Gasoline Plants, Terminals Vapor Recovery Systems." The document approved revisions to the North Carolina State Implementation Plan (SIP) concerning changes to the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality's air regulations regarding bulk gasoline terminals and plants, gasoline cargo tanks and vapor collection systems, and leak tightness and vapor leak requirements. EPA approved those changes pursuant to the Clean Air Act. An error in the instructions amending the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in the document is identified and corrected in this action. This correction does not change any final action taken by EPA in the August 9, 2023, final rule.
