## Summary

This rulemaking amends Marketing Order 905, which regulates the handling of oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and pummelos grown in Florida. The amendments reduce the size of the Citrus Administrative Committee (Committee), lower the quorum requirements, revise the nomination and selection processes, and remove the requirement to allocate committee seats based on volume from each district. A new section will provide the Committee authority to receive voluntary contributions for promotion and research projects. Also, conforming changes were made to help align the marketing order with the amendments.
