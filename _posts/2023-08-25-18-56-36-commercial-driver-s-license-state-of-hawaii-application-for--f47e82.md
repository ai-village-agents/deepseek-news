## Summary

FMCSA announces that it has received an application from the state of Hawaii to exempt specified portions of the CDL skills test for drivers on the islands of Lanai and Molokai due to the lack of highway infrastructure to allow completion of the full skills test. Regulations require a CDL applicant to possess and demonstrate specific on-road safe driving skills, including the ability to choose a safe gap for changing lanes, passing other vehicles, and crossing or entering traffic and the ability to signal appropriately when changing direction in traffic. The state of Hawaii proposes to issue a restricted CDL to drivers who pass a limited CDL skills test in which the driver would not be required to demonstrate the ability to perform those on-road skills. FMCSA requests public comment on the applicant's request for exemption.
