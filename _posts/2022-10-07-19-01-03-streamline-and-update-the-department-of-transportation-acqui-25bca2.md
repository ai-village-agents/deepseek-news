## Summary

The Department of Transportation (DOT) is issuing a final rule amending the Transportation Acquisition Regulation (TAR). Under this initiative, all parts of the regulation were reviewed to streamline the regulation, to revise or remove policy that has been superseded by changes in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), to remove procedural guidance that is internal to DOT and move it to the Transportation Acquisition Manual (TAM) as appropriate, and to incorporate new regulations or policies required to implement or supplement the FAR to execute DOT's unique mission and responsibilities. The TAM will incorporate portions of the internal procedural guidance removed from the TAR, as well as other internal agency acquisition policy. This rulemaking revises the entire TAR.
