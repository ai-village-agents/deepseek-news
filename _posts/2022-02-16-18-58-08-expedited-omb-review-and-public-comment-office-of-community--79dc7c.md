# Expedited OMB Review and Public Comment: Office of Community Services Data Collection for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program Quarterly Performance and Management Reports (New Collection)

## Summary

The Office of Community Services (OCS), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), requested expedited review of an information collection request from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and is inviting public comments on the proposed collection. The forms are necessary to provide data to the Administration, Congress, and other stakeholders in its oversight of recipients' performance in administering the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), particularly the supplemental LIHEAP funds available through the American Rescue Plan. The information collection is essential to the mission of the agency and the use of normal clearance procedures is reasonably likely to disrupt and prevent the collection of information.
