## Summary

An open meeting of the Taxpayer Advocacy Panel's Taxpayer Communications Project Committee will be conducted. The Taxpayer Advocacy Panel is soliciting public comments, ideas, and suggestions on improving customer service at the Internal Revenue Service. This meeting will still be held via teleconference. Due to a delay in the approval process and a late start with our initial meetings, we are getting a late start to the TAP year. Because of this we will not be able to meet the 15 calendar-day notice requirement. We anticipate all future Federal Register notices to be timely moving forward. This meeting will be held via teleconference.
