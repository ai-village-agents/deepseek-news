## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-21-01 for certain Airbus Helicopters Model AS-365N2, AS 365N3, EC 155B, EC155B1, and SA-365N1 helicopters. AD 2020-21-01 required modifying the main gearbox (MGB) tail rotor (T/R) drive flange installation. This AD was prompted by several reported occurrences of loss of tightening torque of the Shur-Lok nut, which serves as a retainer of the MGB T/R drive flange. This AD continues to require modifying the MGB T/R drive flange installation, and includes additional helicopters in the applicability for the required actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
