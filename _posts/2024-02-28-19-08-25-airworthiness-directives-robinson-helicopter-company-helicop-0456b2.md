## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Robinson Helicopter Company Model R44 and R44 II helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of a fractured clutch shaft forward yoke (yoke) on the main rotor (M/R) drive due to fatigue cracking. This proposed AD would require visually inspecting a certain part-numbered flex plate assembly (flex plate) and certain part- numbered yokes, including each yoke bolt, and depending on the inspection results, removing an affected part from service and replacing an affected part with an airworthy part. This proposed AD would also require removing a certain part-numbered yoke from service after accumulating a certain number of hours time-in-service (TIS) or a certain number of years, or as an alternative to removing the part from service, performing a 10X or higher power magnification visual inspection and, if needed, a magnetic particle inspection. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
