## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-19-02, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A330-200, -200 Freighter, and -300 series airplanes; and Model A330-841 and A330-941 airplanes. AD 2022-19-02 requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-19- 02, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would continue to require certain actions in AD 2022-19-02 and would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
