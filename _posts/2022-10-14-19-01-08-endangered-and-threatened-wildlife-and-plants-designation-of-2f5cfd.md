## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to designate critical habitat for Sideroxylon reclinatum ssp. austrofloridense (Everglades bully), Digitaria pauciflora (Florida pineland crabgrass), Chamaesyce deltoidea ssp. pinetorum (pineland sandmat), and Dalea carthagenensis var. floridana (Florida prairie- clover) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. In total, approximately 179,680 acres (72,714 hectares) for Everglades bully, 177,879 acres (71,985 hectares) for Florida pineland crabgrass, 8,867 acres (3,588 hectares) for pineland sandmat, and 179,300 acres (72,560 hectares) for Florida prairie-clover in Monroe, Collier, and Miami-Dade Counties, Florida, fall within the boundaries of the proposed critical habitat designations. If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would extend the Act's protections to the species' critical habitats. We also announce the availability of a draft economic analysis (DEA) of the proposed designations of critical habitat for these four plant species.
