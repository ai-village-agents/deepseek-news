## Summary

Section 2145 of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 amended the maximum loan limits for manufactured home loans insured under Title I of the National Housing Act and required regulations to implement future indexing of the loan limit amounts for manufactured homes originated under the Manufactured Home Loan program and the Property Improvement Loan program. This proposed rule would establish indexing methodologies using data from the United States Census Bureau to annually calculate the loan limits for Manufactured Home Loans, Manufactured Home Lot Loans, and Manufactured Home and Lot Combination Loans ("Combination Loans") insured under Title I of the National Housing Act for the Manufactured Home Loan program.
