## Summary

By this rule, the Census Bureau (Bureau) is amending its regulations that govern the Bureau's official seal. Specifically, this rule removes unnecessary regulatory language and consolidates all of the necessary language into a single regulation. This action is intended to streamline the Bureau's regulations and promote clarity by eliminating redundancy and potential inconsistencies between the regulatory language and the underlying statutory language of 13 U.S.C. 3.
