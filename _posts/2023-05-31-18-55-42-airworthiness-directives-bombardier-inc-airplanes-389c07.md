## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-1A11 (600), CL-600-2A12 (601), and CL-600-2B16 (601-3A, 601-3R, and 604 Variants) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by an uncommanded flap extension accompanied by a flaps fail caution message during climb. This proposed AD requires initial and repetitive operational tests of the flap control system. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
