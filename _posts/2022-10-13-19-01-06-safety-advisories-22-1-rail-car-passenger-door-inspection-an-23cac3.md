## Summary

The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) is issuing Safety Advisory 22-1 (SA 22-1) to recommend that State Safety Oversight Agencies (SSOAs) direct Rail Transit Agencies (RTAs) that operate Rail Fixed Guideway Public Transportation Systems in their jurisdictions to evaluate the sufficiency of rail car passenger door inspection and function testing procedures. FTA is issuing Safety Advisory 22-2 (SA 22-2) to recommend that SSOAs direct RTAs that operate Rail Fixed Guideway Public Transportation Systems in their jurisdictions to consider signal system safety and train control as part of the RTA's Safety Risk Management (SRM) process. In addition, FTA recommends SSOAs incorporate SA 22-2 into their oversight activities. FTA SA 22-1 "Rail Car Passenger Door Inspection and Functional Testing" and SA 22-2 "Signal System Safety and Train Control" are available in their entirety on the agency's public website: (https://www.transit.dot.gov/regulations-and-guidance/safety/ fta-safety-advisories).
