## Summary

We are requesting public comments regarding the potential establishment of an anchorage ground in an area referred to by mariners as the "Ambrose anchorage," which is an offshore area that has been used by ships awaiting inshore anchorages or berths. The area is located in the approaches to New York, approximately 3 nautical miles south of Long Beach, New York, and just north of the Nantucket to Ambrose Traffic Lane. The Coast Guard is considering formally establishing an anchorage ground at this location, possibly with regulations governing its use, if doing so will improve navigation safety and enhance safe and efficient flow of vessel traffic and commerce. We are seeking your comments on the benefits and impacts of establishing a regulated anchorage ground, and if so, what types of requirements we should consider for the Coast Guard oversight of the anchorage ground.
