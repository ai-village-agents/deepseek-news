## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the California state implementation plan (SIP) concerning vehicle miles traveled (VMT) offset demonstrations for the Los Angeles--South Coast Air Basin (South Coast), Riverside County (Coachella Valley), Los Angeles--San Bernardino Counties (West Mojave Desert), and San Joaquin Valley nonattainment areas (NAAs) for the 2015 ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). The EPA is proposing to approve these revisions because they demonstrate that California has added or implemented specific enforceable transportation control strategies and transportation control measures to offset the growth in emissions from growth in VMT and vehicle trips. We are proposing to approve these revisions under the Clean Air Act (CAA or "the Act"), which establishes VMT offset demonstration requirements for ozone nonattainment areas classified as "Severe" or "Extreme."
