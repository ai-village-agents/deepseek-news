## Summary

The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) authorizes FDA to award priority review vouchers to sponsors of approved rare pediatric disease product applications that meet certain criteria. FDA is required to publish notice of the award of the priority review voucher. FDA has determined that VEOPOZ (pozelimab-bbfg), manufactured by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., meets the criteria for a priority review voucher.
