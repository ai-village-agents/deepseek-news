## Summary

The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations on the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program under 34 CFR 685.219 to exclude employers that engage in activities that have a substantial illegal purpose. The proposed regulations would prevent taxpayer-funded PSLF benefits from being improperly provided to individuals who are employed by organizations that engage in activities that have a substantial illegal purpose. These proposed changes are intended to improve the administration of the PSLF program and provide protection for taxpayers.
