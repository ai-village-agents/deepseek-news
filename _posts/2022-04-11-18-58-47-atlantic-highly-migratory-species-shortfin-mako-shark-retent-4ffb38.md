## Summary

NMFS is proposing to implement a flexible shortfin mako shark retention limit with a default limit of zero in commercial and recreational Atlantic highly migratory species (HMS) fisheries. NMFS proposes to leave the default limit of zero in place unless and until changed. Changes to the retention limit could only be made based on regulatory criteria and only if consistent with an allowable retention determination made by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) pursuant to Recommendation 21-09. This action is necessary to implement the binding recommendation of ICCAT adopted in 2021, as authorized under the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (ATCA), and to achieve domestic management objectives under the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act).
