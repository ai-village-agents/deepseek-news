## Summary

We, NMFS, are issuing a proposed rule to change the status of pillar coral (Dendrogyra cylindrus) on the Federal List of Threatened and Endangered Species from threatened to endangered as recommended in the recent 5-year review of the species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973. We propose this action based on population declines and susceptibility to a recently emerged coral disease.
