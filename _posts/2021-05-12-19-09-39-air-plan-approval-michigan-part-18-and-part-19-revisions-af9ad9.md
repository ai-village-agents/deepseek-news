## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) promulgated revisions to its Part 18 Prevention of Significant Deterioration of Air Quality rule and the Part 19 New Source Review for Major Sources Impacting Nonattainment Areas rule. The revisions made to Parts 18 and 19 were adopted to ensure consistency with Federal rule language and other parts of the Michigan air quality rules. The proposed rule changes are administrative and are intended to provide clarity to the already approved rule language.
