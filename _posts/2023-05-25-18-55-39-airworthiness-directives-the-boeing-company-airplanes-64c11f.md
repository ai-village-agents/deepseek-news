## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of a loss of water pressure during flight and water leaks that affected multiple pieces of electronic equipment. This AD requires a detailed visual inspection of all door 1 and door 3 lavatory and galley potable water systems for any missing or incorrectly installed clamshell couplings, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
