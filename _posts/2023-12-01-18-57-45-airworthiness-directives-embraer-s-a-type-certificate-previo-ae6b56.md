## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Embraer S.A. Model ERJ 190-300 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of unexpected wear on the wing hinge bearing assembly of the aileron surfaces found during the functional test of the aileron control system backlash. This AD requires repetitive inspections of the press-fitted bushings of the wing ailerons for migration and broken sealant, measurements of the distance between the aileron surfaces and hinge fittings, functional checks of the backlash of the wing aileron control system, and all applicable related investigative and corrective actions, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
