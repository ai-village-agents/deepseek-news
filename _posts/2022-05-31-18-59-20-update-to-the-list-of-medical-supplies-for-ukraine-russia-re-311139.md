## Summary

The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is publishing the list of items defined as medical supplies and generally licensed for exportation or reexportation to the Crimea region of Ukraine. The List of Medical Supplies (the "List") has previously existed as a companion document to Ukraine-/Russia- related General License 4, which OFAC has incorporated into its Ukraine-/Russia-Related Sanctions Regulations. Accordingly, OFAC is amending the List to replace the reference to General License 4 with a reference to the location of the general license in the Ukraine-/ Russia-Related Sanctions Regulations. OFAC is making several technical corrections to items on the List, but is not making any substantive changes to the List, which was last updated on August 12, 2016.
