## Summary

As a result of the determinations by the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) orders on raw flexible magnets from the People's Republic of China (China) and Taiwan, and revocation of the countervailing duty (CVD) order on raw flexible magnets from China would likely lead to the continuation or recurrence of dumping, countervailable subsidies, and material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation of the AD orders and the CVD order.
