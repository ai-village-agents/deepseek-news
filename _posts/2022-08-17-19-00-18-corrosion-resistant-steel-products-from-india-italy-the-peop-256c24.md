## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) determined in their five-year (sunset) reviews that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) orders on corrosion-resistant steel products (CORE) from India, Italy, the People's Republic of China (China), the Republic of Korea (Korea), and Taiwan and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on CORE from India, Italy, China, and Korea would likely lead to a continuation or recurrence of dumping and net countervailable subsidies, and material injury to an industry in the United States. As a result, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation of these AD and CVD orders.
