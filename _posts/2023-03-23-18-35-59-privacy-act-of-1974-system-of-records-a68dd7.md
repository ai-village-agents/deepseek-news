## Summary

The Customer User Provisioning System (CUPS) is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that provisions mainframe accounts. It is used for requesting and monitoring user access to the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) computer resources. CUPS uses functional tasks to provide access to computer systems, data files, and other software tools. CUPS is available 24/7, allowing field facility CUPS Points of Contact (POC) to register employees by entering Infrastructure and Operations (IO) System Access Request (e9957), at any time. CUPS processes requests immediately, registering employees for access to specific computer systems and data in real time, seven days a week. CUPS System Managers of Record (SMR), and SMR designees, use CUPS to monitor registration activity. The business owner of CUPS is the VA Data Center Operations (DCO), AITC.
