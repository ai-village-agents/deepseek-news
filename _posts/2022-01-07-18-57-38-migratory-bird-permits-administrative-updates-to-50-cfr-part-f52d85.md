# Migratory Bird Permits; Administrative Updates to 50 CFR Parts 21 and 22

## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are renumbering, renaming, and rearranging certain subparts and sections in our regulations. These changes will provide users a more organized road map of the Service's migratory bird and eagle permit processes and improve readability of the regulations. These changes necessitate updating cross-references to the affected section numbers in other parts of our regulations. In addition, we are making several nonsubstantive, editorial revisions to correct misspellings, update internet addresses, update applicable Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control numbers, and add or update relevant family and scientific names. This rule is a purely administrative action; it does not change the species protected by, the permit requirements of, or any other requirements of the regulations.
