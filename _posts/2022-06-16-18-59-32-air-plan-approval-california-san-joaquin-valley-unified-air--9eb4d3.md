## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a revision to the San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District (SJVUAPCD or the "District") portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). This revision concerns emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) and particulate matter (PM) from agricultural open burning. We are approving additional local restrictions on such burning under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act).
