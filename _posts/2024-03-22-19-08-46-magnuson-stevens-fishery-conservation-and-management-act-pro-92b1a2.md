## Summary

This action proposes to approve and implement Framework Adjustment 66 to the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan. This rule proposes to set catch limits for 8 of the 20 multispecies stocks, modify the accountability measure trigger for Atlantic halibut, and make a temporary modification to the accountability trigger for the scallop fishery for Georges Bank yellowtail flounder. This action is necessary to respond to updated scientific information and to achieve the goals and objectives of the fishery management plan. The proposed measures are intended to help prevent overfishing, rebuild overfished stocks, achieve optimum yield, and ensure that management measures are based on the best scientific information available.
