## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a revision to the San Diego County Air Pollution Control District's (SDCAPCD or "District") portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). This revision concerns a negative declaration for the 2008 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) in the ozone nonattainment area under the jurisdiction of the SDCAPCD and one volatile organic compound (VOC) rule covering transfer of organic compounds into mobile transport trucks. We are approving a local rule to regulate these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or "the Act") and the negative declaration. We are also correcting sections in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) to reflect the current status of certain provisions of the California SIP.
