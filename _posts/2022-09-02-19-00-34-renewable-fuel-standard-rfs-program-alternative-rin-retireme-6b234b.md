## Summary

EPA is finalizing an optional alternative renewable identification number (RIN) retirement schedule for small refineries under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program for the 2020 compliance year. Small refineries that elect to use the alternative RIN retirement schedule will have to fully comply with their 2020 RFS obligations-- including any RIN deficits from 2019 carried forward into the 2020 compliance year--by February 1, 2024. EPA is taking this action because small refineries may need more time to plan for compliance with their RFS obligations given EPA's delay in deciding small refinery exemption (SRE) petitions and setting the associated compliance deadlines.
