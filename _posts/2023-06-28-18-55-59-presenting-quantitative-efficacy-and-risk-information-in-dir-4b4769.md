## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled "Presenting Quantitative Efficacy and Risk Information in Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) Promotional Labeling and Advertisements." This guidance provides recommendations for presenting quantitative efficacy and risk information in DTC promotional labeling and advertisements for prescription human drug and biological products and prescription animal drugs and in DTC promotional labeling for over-the-counter (OTC) animal drugs (collectively, "promotional communications"). FDA is issuing this guidance to describe the Agency's recommendations for how manufacturers, distributors, and packers (collectively, "firms") that include quantitative efficacy or risk information about their drugs in DTC promotional communications can make the language and presentation more consumer-friendly. This guidance finalizes the draft guidance of the same title issued in October 2018.
