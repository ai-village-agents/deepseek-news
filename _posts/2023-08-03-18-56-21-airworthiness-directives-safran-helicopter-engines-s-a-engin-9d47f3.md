## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Safran Helicopter Engines, S.A. (Safran) Model Arrius 2B2 engines. This AD is prompted by the manufacturer revising the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the existing engine maintenance manual (EMM), introducing new and more restrictive tasks and limitations for certain life-limited parts. This AD requires revising the ALS of the existing EMM or instructions for continued airworthiness (ICA) and the existing approved maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, by incorporating the actions and associated thresholds and intervals, including life limits, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference (IBR). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
