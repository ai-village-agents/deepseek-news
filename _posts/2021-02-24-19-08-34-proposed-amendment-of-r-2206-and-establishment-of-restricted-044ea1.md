# Proposed Amendment of R-2206 and Establishment of Restricted Areas R-2206B, R-2206C, R-2206D, R-2206E, R-2206F, and R-2206G; Clear, AK

## Summary

This action proposes to rename the established restricted areas R-2206 to R-2206A and establish six new restricted areas R-2206B, R-2206C, R-2206D, R-2206E, R-2206F, and R-2206G, over the Clear Air Force Station (Clear AFS) at Clear, AK. The United States Air Force (USAF) on behalf of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) requested this action to protect aircraft from hazardous High-Intensity Radiated Field (HIRF) produced by the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) at Clear AFS. LRDR contributes to the MDA's mission of developing and deploying a layered Department of Defense (DoD) Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to defend the United States from ballistic missile attacks of all ranges in all phases of flight. The proposed restricted areas are necessary to protect aviation from the hazardous HIRF and segregate non-participating aircraft.
