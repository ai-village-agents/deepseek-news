## Summary

In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), this notice announces that the Information Collection Request (ICR) summarized below will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval. This document describes a collection of information for which NHTSA intends to seek a revision to an OMB-approved collection titled, "Drivers' Use of Camera-Based Rear Visibility Systems Versus Traditional Mirrors" identified by OMB Control Number 2127-0756. The collection is currently approved through July 31, 2025, and supports research addressing safety-related aspects of drivers' use of camera-based rear visibility systems designed to replace or supplement vehicle rearview mirrors. This collection is necessary to inform next steps on an ANPRM NHTSA published in response to two petitions requesting revision of FMVSS No. 111 to permit such camera-based systems as an alternative compliance option for certain current requirements specifying rearview mirrors. This revision includes changes in respondents and thus a change in burden hours and requests an extension to continue data collection. A Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following information collection was published on May 16, 2025. No comments were received. A summary of comments and responses to them is provided below.
