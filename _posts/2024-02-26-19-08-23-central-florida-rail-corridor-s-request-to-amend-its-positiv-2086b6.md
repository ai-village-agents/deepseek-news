## Summary

This document provides the public with notice that, on February 15, 2024, the Central Florida Rail Corridor (CFRC) submitted a request for amendment (RFA) to its FRA-certified positive train control (PTC) system in order to temporarily disable its PTC system between Milepost (MP) 749.60 and MP 755.4 to perform infrastructure upgrades to better facilitate vehicular travel across a crossing. As this RFA may involve a request for FRA's approval of proposed material modifications to an FRA-certified PTC system, FRA is publishing this notice and inviting public comment on CFRC's RFA to its PTC system.
