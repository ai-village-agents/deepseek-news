## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Canada Limited Partnership (ACLP) Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500- 1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a design review of aircraft structural and stress reports that resulted in a revision of operational loads for some aircraft flight phases. This AD requires using a certain version of the aircraft structural repair manual (ASRP) and a review and disposition of repairs based on previous versions, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
