## Summary

The Maritime Administration (MARAD) invites public comments on our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The information to be collected will be used to aid in identifying oceangoing vessels that may be both useful and available to the Department of Defense for deploying U.S. military equipment (such as tanks and other tracked and wheeled vehicles) and the full range of supplies (including petroleum products and fuel) necessary to sustain a force in a foreign theater of operations. We are required to publish this notice in the Federal Register by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
