# Reporting Requirements for Commercial Television Broadcast Station Blackouts

## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission proposes a reporting framework for TV station blackouts occurring on video service platforms offered by cable operators, satellite TV providers, and other multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs). The proposed rule would require notification to the Commission when broadcast programming is disrupted for over 24 hours as a result of an inability to obtain a broadcast station's consent to retransmit its signal. The proposed reporting framework would require MVPDs to publicly report to the Commission the beginning and end of any qualifying blackout of a commercial broadcast television station, or stations, and disclose either publicly or confidentially the number of subscribers affected by the blackout. Timely notification of these blackouts via a Commission-hosted reporting portal would ensure that the Commission and the public receive prompt and accurate information about critical MVPD service disruptions involving broadcast stations when they occur.
