## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") is publishing this concept release to solicit comments on whether to amend the asset-level disclosure requirements for residential mortgage-backed securities in Item 1125 of Regulation AB and whether to revise generally the definition of "asset-backed security" and/or other definitions in Item 1101 of Regulation AB. The Commission is considering these steps to expand issuer and investor access to the registered asset-backed securities markets and facilitate enhanced capital formation and liquidity while maintaining appropriate investor protections.
