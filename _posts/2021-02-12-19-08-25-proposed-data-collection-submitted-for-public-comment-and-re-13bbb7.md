## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies to take this opportunity to comment on proposed and/or continuing information collections, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled National Center for Health Statistics' Research and Development Survey (RANDS) during COVID-19-- Round 3. The Research and Development Survey (RANDS) is designed to quickly obtain and disseminate information about selected population health characteristics during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, and to provide documentation supporting the validity of pandemic-related survey questions, including questions, such as those on telehealth access and use, that will continue to be important for public health after the pandemic.
