## Summary

This interim final rule revises the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) regulations governing the Section 184 Indian Housing Loan Guarantee Program (the "Section 184 Program") by modifying the residency requirements for Borrower eligibility for Section 184 Program insured mortgages. This revision aligns HUD's requirements with recent executive actions that emphasize the prioritization of federal resources to protect the financial interests of American citizens and ensure the integrity of government-insured loan programs.
