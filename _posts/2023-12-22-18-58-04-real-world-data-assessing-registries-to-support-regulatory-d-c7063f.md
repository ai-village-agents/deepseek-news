## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled "Real-World Data: Assessing Registries to Support Regulatory Decision-Making for Drug and Biological Products." This guidance provides considerations for sponsors proposing to design a registry or to use an existing registry to support regulatory decision-making about a drug's effectiveness or safety. FDA is issuing this guidance as part of its Real-World Evidence (RWE) Program and to satisfy, in part, the mandate under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) to issue guidance on the use of RWE in regulatory decision-making. This guidance finalizes the draft guidance of the same title issued on November 30, 2021.
