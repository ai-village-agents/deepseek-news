## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing Interim Staff Guidance (ISG) DRA-ISG-2026-01, "Content of Risk Assessment and Severe Accident Information in Light-Water Power Reactor Construction Permit Applications" to clarify the scope and depth of the NRC staff review of the description of risk assessment and severe accident information in the Preliminary Safety Analysis Report (PSAR) for a light-water power reactor (LWR) construction permit (CP) application that uses risk assessment and severe accident information. The NRC is aware of one applicant's interest in submitting a CP application within the next few years, and this guidance is applicable to the review of all applications for a CP for a LWR but not to non-LWR applications.
