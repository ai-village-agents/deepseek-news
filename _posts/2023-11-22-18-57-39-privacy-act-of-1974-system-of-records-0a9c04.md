## Summary

The Federal Communication Commission (FCC or Commission, or the Agency) proposes to modify an existing system of records, FCC/OMD- 25, Financial Operations Information System (FOIS), subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) as amended. This action is necessary to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act to publish in the Federal Register notice of the existence and character of records maintained by the agency. The records in this system pertain to the mission and activities of the FCC's Financial Operations (FO) organization in the Office of Managing Director (OMD), which are associated with the Commission's financial and budgetary operations, programs, activities, and transactions. This modification makes various necessary changes and updates, including slightly renaming the system to reflect the fact that the system of records covers multiple systems and applications, clerical and clarity edits, formatting changes required by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-108 since its previous publication, the addition of one new routine use, the deletion of two routine uses, and the revision of multiple existing routine uses.
