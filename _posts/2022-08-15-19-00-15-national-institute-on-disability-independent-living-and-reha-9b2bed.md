## Summary

The Administration for Community Living (ACL) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS or the Department) is amending its regulations for the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR). These minor amendments to NIDILRR's peer review criteria allow NIDILRR to better evaluate the extent to which our grant applicants conduct outreach to people with disabilities and people from other groups that traditionally have been underserved and underrepresented, as described in Executive Order 13985, and emphasize the need for research and development activities that apply appropriate engineering knowledge and techniques within NIDILRR's Rehabilitation Engineering Research Centers (RERC) program.
