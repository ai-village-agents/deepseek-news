## Summary

The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, conducts a preclearance consultation program to provide the general public and federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on proposed and/or continuing collections of information in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This program helps to ensure that requested data is provided in the desired format; reporting burden (time and financial resources) is minimized; collection instruments are clearly understood; and the impact of collection requirements on respondents is properly assessed. Currently, the National Endowment for the Arts is soliciting comments concerning the proposed information collection through two surveys: The Program Feedback Survey and the Event Feedback Survey for individuals who participate in community arts programs and events, respectively funded by the Creative Forces[supreg]: NEA Military Healing Arts Network Community Arts Engagement Subgranting Program. A copy of the information collection request can be obtained by contacting the office listed below in the address section of this notice.
