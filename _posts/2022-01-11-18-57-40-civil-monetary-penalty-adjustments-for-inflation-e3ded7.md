## Summary

In this final rule, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) makes the 2022 annual inflation adjustment to its civil monetary penalties. On November 2, 2015, the President signed into law The Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015 (the 2015 Act). Pursuant to the 2015 Act, all agencies must adjust their civil monetary penalties annually and publish the adjustment in the Federal Register. Accordingly, this final rule adjusts the Department's civil monetary penalties for 2021 pursuant to the 2015 Act and Executive Office of the President (EOP) Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance. The new penalties will be effective for penalties assessed after January 11, 2022 whose associated violations occurred after November 2, 2015.
