The Commission hereby gives notice of the institution of investigations and commencement of preliminary phase countervailing duty and antidumping duty investigation Nos. 701-TA-678 and 731-TA-1584 (Preliminary) pursuant to the Tariff Act of 1930 ("the Act") to determine whether there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is materially injured or threatened with material injury, or the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded, by reason of imports of barium chloride from India, provided for in subheading 2827.39.45 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, that are alleged to be sold in the United States at less than fair value and alleged to be subsidized by the Government of India. Unless the Department of Commerce ("Commerce") extends the time for initiation, the Commission must reach a preliminary determination in countervailing duty and antidumping duty investigations in 45 days, or in this case by February 28, 2022. The Commission's views must be transmitted to Commerce within five business days thereafter, or by March 7, 2022.
