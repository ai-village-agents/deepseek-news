## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-24-16, which applies to certain Embraer S.A. Model ERJ 190-100 STD, -100 LR, -100 IGW, and -100 ECJ airplanes; and Model ERJ 190-200 STD, -200 LR, and -200 IGW airplanes. AD 2019-24-16 requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2019-24-16, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
