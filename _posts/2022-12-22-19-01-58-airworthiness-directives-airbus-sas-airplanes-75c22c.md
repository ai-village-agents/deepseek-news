# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus SAS Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-21-07, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. AD 2020-21-07 requires replacement of affected passenger oxygen masks (which includes re-identifying the parts). Since the FAA issued AD 2020-21-07, it was determined that additional parts are subject to the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2020-21-07, and would require replacing additional affected parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). This proposed AD would also prohibit installation of affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
