## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled "Benefit- Risk Considerations for Product Quality Assessments." This guidance describes the benefit-risk principles applied by FDA when conducting product quality-related assessments of chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) information submitted for FDA assessment as part of original new drug applications (NDAs), original biologics license applications (BLAs), or supplements to such applications, in addition to other information (e.g., inspectional findings) available to FDA during its assessment. This guidance discusses how FDA assesses risks, sources of uncertainty, and possible mitigation strategies for a product quality-related issue and how those considerations inform FDA's understanding of the potential effect on a product. This guidance also discusses how unresolved product quality issues may be addressed in the context of regulatory decision making. The guidance notes that product quality assessments are also done for abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), and it discusses how, in certain rare circumstances, unresolved product quality issues may be addressed when there is an urgent clinical need for an ANDA (e.g., a public health emergency or a pervasive drug shortage).
