## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-2B16 (604 Variant) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of sparking due to damaged wire insulation in the fueling adapter. This proposed AD would require inspecting the electrical wires attached to the airplane connector located behind the fuel scupper for damage, and all applicable related investigative and corrective actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
