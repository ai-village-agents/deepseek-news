## Summary

Through this notice, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announces that the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) is extending the designation of Somalia for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 18 months, beginning on March 18, 2023, and ending on September 17, 2024. This extension allows existing TPS beneficiaries to retain TPS through September 17, 2024, so long as they otherwise continue to meet the eligibility requirements for TPS. Existing TPS beneficiaries who wish to extend their status through September 17, 2024, must re-register during the 60-day re-registration period described in this notice. The Secretary is also redesignating Somalia for TPS. The redesignation of Somalia allows additional Somali nationals (and individuals having no nationality who last habitually resided in Somalia) who have been continuously residing in the United States since January 11, 2023, to apply for TPS for the first time during the initial registration period described under the redesignation information in this notice. In addition to demonstrating continuous residence in the United States since January 11, 2023, and meeting other eligibility criteria, applicants for TPS under this designation must demonstrate that they have been continuously physically present in the United States since March 18, 2023, the effective date of this redesignation of Somalia for TPS.
