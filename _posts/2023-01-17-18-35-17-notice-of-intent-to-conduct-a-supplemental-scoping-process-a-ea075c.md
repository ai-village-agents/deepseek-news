## Summary

On December 19, 2022, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued a Federal Register notice detailing its intent to conduct an additional limited scoping process to gather information necessary to prepare a supplement to its environmental impact statement (EIS) to evaluate the environmental impacts of subsequent license renewal (SLR) of Renewed Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-38, DPR-47, and DPR-55 for Oconee Nuclear Station (Oconee), Units 1, 2, and 3. The NRC is seeking public comment on the proper scope of the EIS supplement to be prepared for this action. The comment period was originally scheduled to close on January 18, 2023. The NRC has decided to extend the public scoping period to allow more time for members of the public to develop and submit their comments.
