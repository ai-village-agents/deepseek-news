## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Helicopters (Airbus) Model SA330J helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of restricted movement of the collective lever caused by incidental contact of the secondary stop cover due to a loosened rivet. This AD requires removing the plate of the collective lever secondary stop and replacing it with self-adhesive tape to cover the stop support and decrease the risk of resistance on the rotor flight controls, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
