## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to change the operating schedule that governs the US41 Bridge, mile 16.0, over the Keweenaw Waterway between the towns of Houghton and Hancock, Michigan. The Michigan Department of Transportation, who owns and operates the bridge, has requested a change to the drawbridge operation schedule to help facilitate the movement of all modes of transportation at the bridge.
