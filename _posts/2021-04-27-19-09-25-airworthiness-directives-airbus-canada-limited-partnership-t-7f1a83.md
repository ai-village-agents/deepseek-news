## Summary

The FAA is correcting an airworthiness directive (AD) that was published in the Federal Register. That AD applies to certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500-1A11 airplanes. As published, two references to a Transport Canada Civil Aviation (TCCA) AD number specified in the regulatory text are incorrect. This document corrects those errors. In all other respects, the original document remains the same.
