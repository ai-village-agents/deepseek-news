## Summary

This final rule requires certain airport certificate holders to develop, implement, maintain, and adhere to an airport safety management system (SMS). Certificated airports that qualify under one or more of the following triggering criteria (triggers) are required to develop a SMS under this final rule: are classified as large, medium, or small hubs based on passenger data extracted from the FAA Air Carrier Activity Information System; have a 3-year rolling average of 100,000 or more total annual operations, meaning the sum of all arrivals and departures; or serve any international operation other than general aviation. This rule would expand the safety benefits of SMS to certain certificated airports and further the FAA's aviation- wide approach to SMS implementation in order to address safety at an organizational level.
