## Summary

On September 22, 2023, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) issued the preliminary results of the first full five-year sunset review of the antidumping duty (AD) order on citric acid and certain citrate salts (citric acid) from Belgium. We received no comment from interested parties in opposition to our preliminary results. As a result of our analysis, Commerce finds that revocation of the AD order on citric acid from Belgium would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping at the levels indicated in the "Final Results of Sunset Review" section of this notice.
