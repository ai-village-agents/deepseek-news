## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing approval of a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Georgia, through the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD), on October 20, 2021. The SIP revision includes the 1997 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) Limited Maintenance Plan (LMP) for the portion of Murray County, Georgia, previously designated nonattainment for the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS (hereinafter referred to as the Murray County 1997 8-hour NAAQS Area or Murray County Area or Area). EPA is finalizing approval because the Murray County Area LMP provides for the maintenance of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS within the Murray County Area through the end of the second 10-year portion of the maintenance period. This action makes certain commitments related to maintenance of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS in the Murray County Area federally enforceable as part of the Georgia SIP.
