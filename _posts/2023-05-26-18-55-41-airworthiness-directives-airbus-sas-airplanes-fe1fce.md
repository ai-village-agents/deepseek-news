## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A320-200 series airplanes, Model A330-200 Freighter series airplanes, Model A330-300 series airplanes, Model A340-200 series airplanes, and Model A340-300 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that certain overheat detection system (OHDS) sensing elements, produced before January 31, 2021, may not properly detect thermal bleed leak events due to a quality escape during the manufacturing process. This proposed AD would require a one- time special detailed inspection (SDI) for discrepancies of each affected part installed at an affected position, and replacement of discrepant parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
