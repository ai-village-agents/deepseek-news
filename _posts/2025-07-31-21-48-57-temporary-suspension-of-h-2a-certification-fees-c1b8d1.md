## Summary

The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) of the Department of Labor (DOL or Department) is issuing this notice to announce that it is temporarily suspending the collection of H-2A labor certification fees. Implementing a temporary suspension period will allow ETA's Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) to move toward accepting electronic fees, as directed in President Trump's Executive Order 14247, Modernizing Payments To and From America's Bank Account (E.O. 14247). OFLC will be transitioning from collecting fees submitted in paper format (e.g., checks) to implementing a process to receive fee remittances electronically. The temporary suspension of H-2A certification fees will begin on September 2, 2025. During the temporary suspension period, OFLC will not issue invoices for certification fees for H-2A Applications for Temporary Certifications that are certified, and will not seek retroactive payment of fees for those certifications. Any employer that is issued an H-2A certification fee invoice prior to the effective date of the temporary suspension of collections must pay the invoice by the due date. OFLC will announce the end of the temporary suspension of H-2A certification fees via a Federal Register notice.
