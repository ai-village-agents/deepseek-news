Model ERJ 190-100 STD, -100 LR, -100 IGW, -200 STD, -200 LR, and -200 IGW airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of structural cracks in the wing lower skin stringers on both half wings. This AD requires repetitive inspections for cracking and fuel leakage of the lower skin stringers on both half wings, and applicable related investigative and corrective actions, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC) Brazilian AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also provides optional terminating action for the repetitive inspections. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
