## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Bell Textron Inc., Model 204B, 205A, 205A-1, 205B, 210, 212, 412, 412CF, and 412EP helicopters and various restricted category helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of cracks found on the main transmission support case. This proposed AD would require repetitive inspections of the main transmission housing assembly for cracks, pitting, and corrosion and depending on the results, corrective action. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
