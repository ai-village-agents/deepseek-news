## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all GE Aviation Czech s.r.o. (GEAC) M601D-11 model turboprop engines. This proposed AD was prompted by the manufacturer revising the airworthiness limitation section (ALS) of the existing engine maintenance manual (EMM) to include a visual inspection of the centrifugal compressor case for cracks. This proposed AD would require revising the ALS of the existing EMM to incorporate a visual inspection of the centrifugal compressor case. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
