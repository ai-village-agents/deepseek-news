## Summary

The Coast Guard will enforce Seattle's Seafair Fleet Week Moving Vessels security zones from 11:30 a.m. on August 1, 2022, through 5 p.m. on August 7, 2022. These security zones are necessary to help ensure the security of the vessels from sabotage or other subversive acts during Seafair Fleet Week Parade of Ships. The designated participating vessels are: USS LAKE CHAMPLAIN (CG-57), USS JOHN PAUL JONES (DDG-53), USCGC HENRY BLAKE (WLM-563), USCGC ANACAPA (WPB-1335), USCGC TERRAPIN (WPB-87366), USCGC OSPREY (WPB-87307), HMCS SASKATOON (MM-709), HMCS YELLOWKNIFE (MM-706), and Fireboat LESCHI. During the enforcement period, no person or vessel may enter or remain in the security zones without the permission of the Captain of the Port (COTP), Puget Sound or her designated representative. The COTP has granted general permission for vessels to enter the outer 400 yards of the security zones as long as those vessels within the outer 400 yards of the security zones operate at the minimum speed necessary to maintain course unless required to maintain speed by the navigation rules.
