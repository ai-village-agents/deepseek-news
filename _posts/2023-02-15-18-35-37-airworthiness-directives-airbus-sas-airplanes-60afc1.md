## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-24-13, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2019-24-13 requires repetitive high-frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections for cracking of a stiffener of a certain lateral window frame, and applicable related investigative and corrective actions, as applicable. Since the FAA issued AD 2019-24-13, it was determined that certain inspection times need to be revised. This proposed AD would retain the requirements of AD 2019-24-13, with amended compliance times, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
