## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. This collection involves organizations applying to perform certification functions on behalf of the FAA, including approving data and issuing various aircraft and organization certificates. The information will be used to determine an applicant's qualifications to perform certification functions as a representative of the FAA Administrator and to authorize organizations to perform those functions.
