## Summary

On October 13, 2023, the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) published in the Federal Register a document entitled "Request for Information to Support the Development of a Federal Environmental Justice Science." This RFI invited comments to the Subcommittee on Environmental Justice formed under the National Science and Technology Council Committee on the Environment in support of developing a coordinated Federal strategy to identify and address gaps in science, data, and research related to environmental justice. Information received through this RFI will inform the biennial Environmental Justice Science, Data, and Research Plan (Research Plan). Executive Order 14096 directed the formation of both the Subcommittee on Environmental Justice and the development of the Research Plan. In response to requests by prospective commenters that they would benefit from additional time to adequately consider and respond to the RFI, OSTP has determined that a reopening of the comment period until January 12, 2024 is appropriate.
