## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency is proposing to conform the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act hazardous chemical inventory reporting regulations to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Hazard Communication Standard amendments of 2012 and 2024. The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and its regulations rely on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Hazard Communication Standard for the definition of a hazardous chemical and for the categories of health and physical hazards that must be reported under the hazardous chemical inventory regulations. This action proposes to conform the terminology used and information that must be reported on the hazardous chemical inventory forms to the Hazard Communication Standard amendments. As a result, this proposed action would also improve first responder and community safety, reduce discrepancies and confusion, prevent interpretation burdens on facilities when using (Material) Safety Data Sheets to complete annual hazardous chemical inventory reports, and improve clarity. In the "Rules and Regulations" section of this Federal Register, we are intending to implement the proposed amendments in this proposed rule as a direct final rule without a prior proposed rule. If we receive no adverse comment, we will not take further action on this proposed rule.
