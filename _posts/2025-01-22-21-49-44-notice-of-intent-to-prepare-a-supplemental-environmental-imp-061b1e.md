## Summary

The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Washington State Office, in coordination with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) and the Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology), announces its intent to prepare an SEIS for the Odessa Subarea Special Study Project. The SEIS is necessary to evaluate modification of a component of Alternative 4A that would install a buried pipeline irrigation across lands that were not evaluated in FEIS. Installation of this pipeline would require blasting which was not addressed in FEIS. The intended effect of this action would result in the most economically viable way of providing surface water irrigation to specific cultivated lands in the Study Area in lieu of groundwater irrigation. The SEIS will examine an irrigation delivery system designated East Low Canal (EL) 11.8 that would serve approximately 7,638 acres of land currently served by groundwater in the northeastern portion of the East Columbia Basin Irrigation District (ECBID) in Grant County. NRCS is accepting comments regarding significant issues, potential alternatives, information, and analyses relevant to the proposed action from all interested individuals, Federal and State agencies, and Tribes.
