## Summary

This notice advises the public that BPA is terminating the preparation of the Klickitat Hatchery Upgrades EIS and instead will prepare an EA. This EIS would have considered BPA's decision whether to fund the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation's (Yakama Nation) proposal to upgrade facilities at the Klickitat Hatchery to facilitate a possible increase in production of spring Chinook salmon in the Klickitat River Basin. The change in National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) analysis is due to a refinement of project scope and design that would minimize resource effects and extensive agency coordination that has shown existing permits are sufficient to address the proposed changes.
