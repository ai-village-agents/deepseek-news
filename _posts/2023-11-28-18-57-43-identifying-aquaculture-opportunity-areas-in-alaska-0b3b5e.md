## Summary

NOAA is adding a third webinar-based listening session as part of the process to identify Aquaculture Opportunity Areas (AOAs) in Alaska State waters to help sustainably advance invertebrate (e.g., shellfish, sea cucumber) and seaweed (e.g., macroalgae, kelp) aquaculture, in partnership with the State of Alaska. NOAA requests data, comments, views, information, analysis, or suggestions from the public to support the identification of AOAs in Alaska state waters, including siting parameters that can be used to select potential study areas for further analysis. Please respond to the questions listed in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section, as appropriate. The addition of this listening session does not extend the comment period, which ends on December 18, 2023.
