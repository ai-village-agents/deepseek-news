# Prevailing Rate Systems; Abolishment of Frederick, Maryland, as a Nonappropriated Fund Federal Wage System Wage Area

## Summary

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing a rule to abolish the Frederick, Maryland, nonappropriated fund (NAF) Federal Wage System (FWS) wage area and define Frederick County, MD, to the Anne Arundel, MD, NAF FWS wage area, and Berkeley County, West Virginia, to the Washington, DC, NAF FWS wage area. These changes are necessary because NAF FWS employment in the survey area is now below the minimum criterion of 26 wage employees to maintain a wage area, and the local activities no longer have the capability to conduct local wage surveys.
