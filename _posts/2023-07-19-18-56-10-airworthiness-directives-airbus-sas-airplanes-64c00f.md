## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-16- 18, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A330-200 Freighter, A330-200, A330-300, A330-800, A330-900, A340-200, A340-300, A340-500, and A340- 600 series airplanes. AD 2021-16-18 required repetitive inspections of certain fuel pumps for cavitation erosion, replacement if necessary, revision of the operator's existing minimum equipment list (MEL), and accomplishment of certain maintenance actions related to defueling and ground fuel transfer operations. This AD was prompted by reports of a fuel pump showing cavitation erosion that exposed the fuel pump power supply wires, and a determination that affected fuel pumps must be replaced with new, more erosion resistant pumps. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2021-16-18, and also requires replacement of affected parts, which would terminate the repetitive inspections, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also prohibits the installation of certain affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
