## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to revise existing regulations and consolidate into one table special local regulations for recurring marine events at various locations within the geographic boundaries of the Seventh Coast Guard District Captain of the Port (COTP) Charleston Zone. Consolidating marine events into one table simplifies Coast Guard oversight and public notification of special local regulations within COTP Charleston Zone. The Coast Guard invites your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
