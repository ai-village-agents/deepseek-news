## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model H160-B helicopters. The FAA previously sent this AD as an emergency AD to all known U.S. owners and operators of these helicopters. This emergency AD was prompted by a report of the main rotor pitch rod rupturing during flight. This AD requires replacing the upper and lower pitch rod end bearings on the pitch rods of the main rotor with new pitch rod end bearings and reporting information after accomplishment of the replacement. This emergency AD also prohibits installing any affected main rotor lower and upper pitch rod end bearings on any helicopter, unless it is a serviceable part. The FAA is issuing this emergency AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
