## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, are initiating 5-year status reviews for 100 species in American S[amacr]moa, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Three of these species also occur outside of United States jurisdiction, in Canada and the South Pacific. A 5-year status review is based on the best scientific and commercial data available at the time of the review; therefore, we are requesting submission of any new information on these species that has become available since the last reviews.
