## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC, the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Renewed Facility Operating License (RFOL) No. DPR-20, that was requested by Holtec Palisades, LLC for the Palisades Nuclear Plant (Palisades, PNP). The proposed license amendment would revise the technical specifications to allow for the use of Framatome Alloy 690 sleeves to repair the defective steam generator tubes as an alternative to removing the tubes from service by plugging. This will support the return to service of the steam generators as part of the potential resumption of power operations at the Palisades facility. For the amendment request, the NRC proposes to determine that it involves no significant hazards consideration (NSHC). Because this amendment request contains sensitive unclassified non- safeguards information (SUNSI), an order imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI for contention preparation.
