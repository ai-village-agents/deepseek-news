## Summary

As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) requests comments on a proposed extension of approval of a collection of information from manufacturers and importers of mattresses and mattress pads. The collection of information is set forth in the Standard for the Flammability of Mattresses and Mattress Pads and the Standard for the Flammability (Open Flame) of Mattress Sets. These regulations establish testing and recordkeeping requirements for manufacturers and importers subject to the standards. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) previously approved the collection of information under control number 3041-0014. OMB's most recent extension of approval will expire on August 31, 2023. CPSC will consider all comments received in response to this notice, before requesting an extension of approval of this collection of information from OMB.
