## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the DoD is establishing a new Department-wide system of records titled, "Privacy and Civil Liberties Complaints and Correspondence Records," DoD-0017. This system of records covers DoD's maintenance of records about privacy or civil liberties-related complaints or correspondence submitted to DoD privacy and civil liberties offices. This system of records includes information provided by the individual authoring the correspondence or complaint. Additionally, DoD is issuing a Direct Final Rule to exempt this system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act, elsewhere in today's issue of the Federal Register.
