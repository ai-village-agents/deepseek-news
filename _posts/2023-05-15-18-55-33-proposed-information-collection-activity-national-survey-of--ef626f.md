## Summary

The Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation (OPRE) within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is proposing an extension with revisions to the data collection activities conducted as part of the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW III) (Office of Management and Budget #0970-0202). NSCAW is the only source of nationally representative, longitudinal, firsthand information about the functioning and well-being, service needs, and service utilization of children and families who come to the attention of the child welfare system. This request will allow additional time to conduct participant data collections. Minor changes to the instruments are requested to restore an in-person data collection option.
