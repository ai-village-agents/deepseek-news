## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing a new Order superseding a previously issued Order to Waste Control Specialists LLC (WCS) on December 3, 2014 (2014 Order), as supplemented by NRC letters to WCS from 2016 to 2022. The current and past NRC Orders are associated with an exemption from NRC regulations, which requires persons who own, acquire, deliver, receive, possess, use, or transfer Special Nuclear Material (SNM) to obtain an NRC license pursuant to the NRC requirements. The current action is in response to a request by WCS dated June 30, 2022. In the letter, WCS requested permission to: (1) move the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Waste from the WCS Federal Waste Facility (FWF) disposal cell to the WCS Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facility (TSDF) Bin Storage Area (BSA)-1 Enclosure; (2) prepare the LANL Waste for shipment in the TSDF BSA-1 Enclosure; and (3) temporarily store the LANL Waste in the TSDF BSA-1 Enclosure.
