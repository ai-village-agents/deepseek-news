## Summary

PHMSA is publishing this ANPRM to solicit feedback on potential adjustments to the statutorily mandated hazardous materials registration and fee assessment program. Actions such as the potential adjustment of fees or the addition of other entities among those required to register may be necessary to fund PHMSA's national emergency preparedness grant programs at the newly authorized level in accordance with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021. To fully engage with stakeholders, this ANPRM solicits comments and input on questions related to the scope of the registration and fee assessment program. Any comments, data, and information received will be used to evaluate and draft proposed amendments.
