## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a September 28, 2023, State Implementation Plan (SIP) submittal from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio EPA). The SIP submittal consists of a source-specific volatile organic compound (VOC) limitation for a flexographic printing line cold cleaner at the Valgroup company's plastic extrusion plant in Findlay, Ohio. The source-specific limitation reflects the technological differences between the facility's new control unit and cold cleaner requirements currently established in Ohio's SIP. Ohio EPA has determined that the source-specific VOC limitation for the cold cleaner is more stringent than existing cold cleaner limits in the Ohio SIP. EPA proposed to approve this action on October 7, 2024, and received no adverse comments.
