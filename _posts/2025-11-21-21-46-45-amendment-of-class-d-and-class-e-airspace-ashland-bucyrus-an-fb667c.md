## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class D and Class E airspace at Mansfield, OH; and the Class E airspace at Ashland and Bucyrus, OH. The name of Mansfield Lahm Regional Airport, Mansfield, OH; the name and geographic coordinates of University Hospitals Samaritan Medical Center Heliport, Ashland, OH, and Port Bucyrus/Crawford County Airport, Bucyrus, OH, would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of airspace reviews conducted due to the decommissioning of the Mansfield very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program. This action would bring the airspace into compliance with FAA orders and support instrument flight rule (IFR) procedures and operations.
