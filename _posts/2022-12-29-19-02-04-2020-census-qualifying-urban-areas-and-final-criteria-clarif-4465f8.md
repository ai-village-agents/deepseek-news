## Summary

The Bureau of the Census (Census Bureau) delineates urban areas after each decennial census for the purpose of tabulating and presenting data for the urban and rural population and housing within the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. The Census Bureau delineated the 2020 urban areas based on 2020 Census of Population and Housing counts and density calculations. The Census Bureau's delineation of 2020 urban areas also accounted for non-residential urban land uses, such as commercial, industrial, transportation, and open space that are part of the urban landscape as outlined in the urban area criteria published in the Federal Register on March 24, 2022. This Notice provides the list of areas that qualified as urban based on the results of the 2020 Census for the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. The designation of "rural" encompasses any population, housing, and territory not included in an urban area. Publication of this Notice constitutes the Census Bureau's official announcement of the list of qualifying urban areas for reference by all data users. This Notice also provides clarifications to the Census Bureau's criteria for defining urban areas as published in the Federal Register on March 24, 2022. The clarifications make the criteria easier to understand and interpret consistently and are in accordance with the Census Bureau's concept and delineation of urban areas for the 2020 Census.
