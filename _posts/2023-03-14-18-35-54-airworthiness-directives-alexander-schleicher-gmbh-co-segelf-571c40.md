## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-14- 14, which applied to all Alexander Schleicher GmbH & Co. Segelflugzeugbau Model ASW-15 gliders. AD 2022-14-14 required repetitively inspecting the wing root ribs for cracks, looseness, and damage and replacing any root rib with a crack, a loose rib or lift pin bushing, or any damage. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-14-14, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) superseded its mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) to add all Model ASW-15B gliders to the applicability. This AD is prompted by MCAI originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. This AD retains the requirements from AD 2022-14-14 of repetitively inspecting the wing root ribs for cracks, looseness, and damage and replacing any root rib with a crack, a loose rib or lift pin bushing or any damage; and revises the applicability by adding Model ASW-15B gliders and specifying that this AD applies to all Model ASW-15 and ASW-15B gliders equipped with wooden wing root ribs. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
