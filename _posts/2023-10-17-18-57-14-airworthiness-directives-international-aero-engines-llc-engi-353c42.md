## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain International Aero Engines, LLC (IAE LLC) Model PW1124G1-JM, PW1127G-JM, PW1127GA-JM, PW1129G-JM, PW1130G-JM, PW1133G-JM, and PW1133GA-JM engines. This AD was prompted by a manufacturer investigation which revealed that Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) shops were misinterpreting accepted knife edge coating wear limits on the high-pressure compressor (HPC) rear hub. This AD requires replacement of the HPC rear hub with a part eligible for installation. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
