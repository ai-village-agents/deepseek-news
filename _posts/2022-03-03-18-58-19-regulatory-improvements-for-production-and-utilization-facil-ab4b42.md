## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its regulations that relate to the decommissioning of production and utilization facilities. The NRC's goals in amending these regulations are to maintain a safe, effective, and efficient decommissioning process; reduce the need for license amendment requests and exemptions from existing regulations; address other decommissioning issues deemed relevant by the NRC; and support the NRC's Principles of Good Regulation, including openness, clarity, and reliability. The NRC will hold a public meeting to promote full understanding of this proposed rule and to facilitate public comments.
