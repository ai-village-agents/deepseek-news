## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-09-11 and AD 2022-21-12, which applied to all Fokker Services B.V. Model F28 Mark 0070 and 0100 airplanes. AD 2020-09-11 and AD 2022-21-12 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-21-12, new or more restrictive tasks and limitations have been introduced. This AD continues to require the actions of AD 2022-21-12, and also requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations; as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
