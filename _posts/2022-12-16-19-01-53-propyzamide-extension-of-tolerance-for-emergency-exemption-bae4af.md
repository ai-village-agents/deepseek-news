## Summary

This regulation extends a time-limited tolerance for residues of the herbicide propyzamide in or on cranberry at 1 part per million (ppm) for an additional 3-year period. This tolerance will expire and is revoked on December 31, 2025. This action is in response to EPA's granting of an emergency exemption under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) authorizing use of the pesticide on cranberry. In addition, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) requires EPA to establish a time-limited tolerance or exemption from the requirement for a tolerance for pesticide chemical residues in food that will result from the use of a pesticide under an emergency exemption granted by EPA under FIFRA.
