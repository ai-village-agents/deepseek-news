## Summary

This action finalizes the technology review conducted for the paint stripping and miscellaneous surface coating operations area source categories regulated under national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP). These final amendments also address provisions regarding electronic reporting; make miscellaneous clarifying and technical corrections; simplify the petition for exemption process; and clarify requirements for emissions during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM). We are making no revisions to the numerical emission limits based on the technology review.
