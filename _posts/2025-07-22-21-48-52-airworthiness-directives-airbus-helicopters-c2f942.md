## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model AS 365 N3, EC 155B, and EC155B1 helicopters. This AD was prompted by reports of false engine fire warnings. This AD requires replacing affected engine fire detectors and prohibits installing an affected engine fire detector or an engine that contains an affected engine fire detector. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
