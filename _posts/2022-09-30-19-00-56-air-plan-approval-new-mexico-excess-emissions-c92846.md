## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA, the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision from the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) submitted on October 13, 2016. The submittal is in response to EPA's national SIP call on June 12, 2015, concerning excess emissions during periods of Startup, Shutdown, and Malfunction (SSM). The submittal requests the removal of the provisions identified in the 2015 SIP call from the New Mexico SIP. EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision and proposing to determine that such SIP revision corrects the deficiency identified in the June 12, 2015 SIP call.
