## Summary

The Build America, Buy America Act ("the Act"), enacted as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) on November 15, 2021, provides for the application of domestic preference requirements to infrastructure projects funded by Federal financial assistance and also includes requirements to standardize and simplify application of the Buy American Act in government contracts. The Act directs the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to issue guidance that will assist agencies as they apply the new requirements. OMB seeks input from the public concerning the Act's requirement that any infrastructure projects funded with Federal financial assistance use only construction materials "produced in the United States." The Act also requires the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council) to provide a definition for "end product manufactured in the United States." To that end, OMB also seeks input, as a member of the FAR Council, on a definition for "end product manufactured in the United States," for incorporation into the FAR, as required by the Act.
