## Summary

We, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce receipt of two separate incidental take permit (ITP) applications under the Endangered Species Act (ESA): One from Sean and Dawn Carmichael and the other from John O'Connor (applicant/applicants), under the approved general conservation plan (GCP) and final environmental impact statement (FEIS) for the Alabama beach mouse (ABM; Peromyscus polionotus ammobates). Each applicant requests an ITP to take the federally listed ABM incidental to construction in Baldwin County, Alabama. We request public comment on these applications, which include the applicants' proposed habitat conservation plan (HCP), and on the Service's preliminary determination that the proposed permitting action qualifies under the terms of the ABM GCP.
