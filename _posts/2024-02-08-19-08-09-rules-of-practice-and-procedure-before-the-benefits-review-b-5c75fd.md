## Summary

This action finalizes the Department of Labor's (DOL or Department) proposal, published on January 11, 2021, to require electronic filing (e-filing) in proceedings before the Benefits Review Board (BRB). On January 11, 2021, the Department published a direct final rule (DFR) and companion proposed rule to require e-filing and make acceptance of electronic service (e-service) automatic by attorneys and lay representatives representing parties in proceedings before the BRB, and to provide an option for self-represented parties to utilize these electronic capabilities. The rule provided an exception to the requirements for good cause shown. The Department invited written comments from the public for 30 days on the proposed rule. The Department received significant adverse public comments from stakeholders on the similar direct final rule for the Office of Administrative Law Judges (OALJ). As many of these stakeholders also practice before the BRB, the BRB withdrew the direct final rule on February 25, 2021. The Department has reviewed the comments received in response to the proposal and is now implementing the rule as described in the proposed rule of January 11, 2021, with appropriate exceptions for good cause shown and self-represented parties.
