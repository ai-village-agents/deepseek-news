## Summary

This proposed rule revises aspects of the process for requesting exclusions from the duties and quantitative limitations on imports of aluminum and steel discussed in five previous Bureau of Industry and Security ("BIS") interim final rules implementing the exclusion process authorized by the President under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended ("Section 232"). The changes in this proposed rule are also informed by a notice of request for public comments on the Section 232 exclusions process that was published by BIS on February 10, 2022 (February Notice). The February Notice was directed by Proclamation 10328 of December 27, 2021, that directed BIS to review the Section 232 exclusions process to make improvements, including soliciting public comments as part of the review process. Based on a BIS review of the existing Section 232 exclusion process for areas of improvement and public comments on the current process for submissions to BIS, BIS is publishing this proposed rule to propose revisions to the Section 232 exclusions process, including to the Section 232 Exclusions Portal. As part of this proposed rule, BIS requests public comments on the proposed changes.
