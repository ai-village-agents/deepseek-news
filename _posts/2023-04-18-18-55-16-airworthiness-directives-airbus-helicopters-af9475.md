## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-05-03, which applies to certain Airbus Helicopters Model EC225LP helicopters. AD 2021-05-03 requires various inspections of a certain part-numbered left-hand (LH) engine fuel supply (fuel supply) hose and depending on the inspection results, reinstalling or removing the fuel supply hose from service. AD 2021-05-03 also requires installing an improved part and prohibits installing an affected fuel supply hose on any helicopter unless it is installed by following certain procedures. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-05-03, there were reports of difficulties using an adjusting tool to install the improved fuel supply hose. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions of 2021-05-03 and expand the applicability, expand the parts installation limitations, and require using an improved adjusting tool and updated procedures. This proposed AD would also update certain compliance times and clarify certain requirements. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
