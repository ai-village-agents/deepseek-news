## Summary

Notice is hereby given by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that an exemption to the land disposal restrictions under the 1984 Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) has been granted to Vickery Environmental, Inc. (VEI) of Vickery, Ohio for five Class I injection wells located in Vickery, Ohio. As required by Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, VEI has demonstrated, to a reasonable degree of certainty, that there will be no migration of hazardous constituents out of the injection zone or into an underground source of drinking water (USDW) for at least 10,000 years. This final decision allows the continued underground injection by VEI of only those hazardous wastes designated by the codes in Table 1 through its five Class I hazardous waste injection wells identified as #2, #4, #5, #6, and #8. This decision constitutes a final EPA action for which there is no administrative appeal.
