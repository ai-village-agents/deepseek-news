## Summary

This regulation establishes exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of ortho-benzyl-para-chlorophenol, potassium 2-benzyl-4-chlorophenate, and sodium 2-benzyl-4-chlorophenate on food contact surfaces when applied/used in public eating places, dairy processing equipment, and/or food processing equipment and utensils. These tolerance exemptions are established on the Agency's own initiative under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), in order to implement the tolerance actions EPA identified during its review of these chemicals as part of the Agency's registration review program under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).
