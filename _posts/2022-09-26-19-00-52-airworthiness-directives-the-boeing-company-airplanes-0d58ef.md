## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 767-2C series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that insufficient clearance was found between the right stabilizer trim shut-off control wire (bundle W0589) and an elevator control cable. This AD requires a one-time inspection for insufficient clearance between the elevator control cable and wire bundle W0589 on the airplane's left crown, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
