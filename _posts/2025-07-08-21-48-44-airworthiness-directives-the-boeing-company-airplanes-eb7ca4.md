# Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company (Boeing) Model 757-200, -200PF, and -200CB series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of improper grinding of the inner diameter of the main landing gear (MLG) outer cylinders, resulting in possible heat damage to the outer cylinders. This proposed AD would require a records check or inspection to determine if an affected outer cylinder is installed and replacing all affected outer cylinders. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
