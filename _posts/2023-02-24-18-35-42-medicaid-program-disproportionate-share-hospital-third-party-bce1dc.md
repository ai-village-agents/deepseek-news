## Summary

This proposed rule would address recent legislative changes to the Social Security Act, which governs the hospital-specific limit on Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments, as a result of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. This proposed rule would afford States and hospitals more clarity on how the limit, the changes to which took effect on October 1, 2021, will be calculated. Additionally, this proposed rule would enhance administrative efficiency by making technical changes and clarifications to the DSH program.
