## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Health Hazard Evaluations/ Technical Assistance and Emerging Problems. This proposed collection, in accordance with mandates under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, allows the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to respond to requests for HHEs to identify chemical, biological or physical hazards in workplaces throughout the United States.
