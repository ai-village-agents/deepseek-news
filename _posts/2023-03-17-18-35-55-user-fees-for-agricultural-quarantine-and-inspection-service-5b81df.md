## Summary

We are amending our regulations governing the user fees charged for certain Agricultural Quarantine and Inspection (AQI) services. We are reducing the fees charged to remove surcharges that were intended to fund a reserve. This action is necessary in order to ensure the regulations reflect an operational reduction of AQI fees that was announced through a November 1, 2022, Stakeholder Registry announcement, issued to comply with a September 15, 2022, judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, and which took effect on December 1, 2022.
