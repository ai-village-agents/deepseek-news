## Summary

We, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) have received separate ITP applications from the Oregon Department of State Lands (ODSL; applicant), associated with the Elliott State Research Forest HCP. The applications, including the HCP, have been submitted pursuant to Section 10 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. The applicant is seeking authorization from FWS and NMFS (together, the Services) for the incidental take of three species expected to result from research and management-related activities on the Elliott State Forest in Coos and Douglas Counties, Oregon. These research and management activities include timber removal and infrastructure maintenance. FWS is the lead Federal agency under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and NMFS is a cooperating agency. The availability of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement was announced separately by FWS. NMFS is seeking public comments on the HCP.
