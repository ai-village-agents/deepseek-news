## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a permanent security zone for certain waters of the Cooper River between Charleston and Mount Pleasant, SC. This action is necessary to provide for the security and protection of life on navigable waters near the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge during the annual Cooper River Bridge Run. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from entering the security zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Charleston or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
