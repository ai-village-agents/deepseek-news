## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing Revision 3 to Regulatory Guide (RG), 1.87, "Acceptability of ASME Code, Section III, Division 5, "High Temperature Reactors."" This regulatory guide (RG) describes an approach that is acceptable to the staff of the NRC to assure the mechanical/structural integrity of components that operate in elevated temperature environments and that are subject to time-dependent material properties and failure modes. It endorses, with exceptions and limitations, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel (BPV) Code (ASME Code) Section III, "Rules for Construction of Nuclear Facility Components," Division 5, "High Temperature Reactors," and several related Code Cases.
