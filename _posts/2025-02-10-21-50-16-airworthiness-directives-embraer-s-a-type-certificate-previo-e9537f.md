## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-25- 07, which applied to all Embraer S.A. Model ERJ 170-100 LR, -100 STD, - 100 SE, and -100 SU airplanes; and Model ERJ 170-200 LR, -200 SU, -200 STD, and -200 LL airplanes. AD 2022-25-07 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. This AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD continues to require all actions in AD 2022-25-07 and requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, and certain structural modifications, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
