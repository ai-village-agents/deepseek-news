## Summary

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration intend to prepare a draft monument management plan for the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, which was established by Presidential Proclamation 9496 and updated by Presidential Proclamation 10287. When the draft plan is complete, we will advertise its availability and seek public comment. We furnish this notice to advise the public and Federal, Tribal, State, and local governments and agencies of our intentions, and to obtain suggestions and information on the scope of issues to consider during the planning process. An environmental assessment to evaluate the potential effects of various management alternatives will also be prepared. The environmental assessment will provide resource managers with the information needed to determine if the potential effects may be significant and warrant preparation of an environmental impact statement, or if the potential impacts lead to a finding of no significant impact.
