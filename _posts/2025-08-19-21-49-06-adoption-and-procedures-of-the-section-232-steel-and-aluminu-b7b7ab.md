## Summary

BIS is adding 407 Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) codes to the list of products that will be considered as steel or aluminum derivative products. For such products, steel and aluminum tariffs based on Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (Section 232) will apply to the steel and aluminum content. The non-steel and non-aluminum content will remain subject to the reciprocal and other applicable tariffs. For 60 HTSUS codes, BIS has decided not to include them as steel and aluminum derivative products at this time, because they are subject to other ongoing investigations pursuant to Section 232 or other trade statutes. The complete list of HTSUS codes added to the Section 232 tariffs by today's action is listed in the annexes to this notice.
