## Summary

Through this Notice, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) establishes the Management and Occupancy Review (MOR) schedule for projects assisted under each of seven project-based Section 8 programs administered by the Office of Multifamily Housing Programs. The MOR schedule establishes a frequency for the completion of MORs based upon a project's previous MOR score and the project's rating under HUD's risk-based asset management model. This Notice follows the January 14, 2015, publication of a proposed MOR schedule, on which HUD sought public comments. It adopts a final schedule that reflects changes made in response to such comments.
