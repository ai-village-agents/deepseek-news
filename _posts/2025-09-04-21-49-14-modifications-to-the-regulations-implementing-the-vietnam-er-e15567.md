## Summary

On July 1, 2025, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to revise the implementing regulations for the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, as amended. The comment period for the NPRM was scheduled to close on September 2, 2025. With this notice document, DOL is extending the comment period to September 17, 2025. Commenters who have already submitted public comments do not need to resubmit their comments. DOL will consider all comments received from the date of publication of the NPRM through the close of the extended comment period. Any previous denial of a request to extend the comment period remains denied to the extent the request asked for more than a 15-day extension. Commentors are encouraged to submit all comments by September 17, 2025, as no further extension will be granted.
