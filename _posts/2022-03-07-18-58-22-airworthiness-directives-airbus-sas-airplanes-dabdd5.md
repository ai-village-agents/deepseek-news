## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that in the event of a specific discrete wire failure, the landing gear extension and retraction system (LGERS) may not be able to complete landing gear retraction when commanded by moving the landing gear lever to the UP position. This AD requires revising the operator's existing FAA-approved minimum equipment list (MEL) for the LGERS, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
