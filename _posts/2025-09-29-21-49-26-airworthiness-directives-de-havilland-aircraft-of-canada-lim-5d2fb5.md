## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited Model DHC-8 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of cracked barrel nuts at the wing front spar and horizontal stabilizer to vertical stabilizer joint. This proposed AD would require repetitive inspections for cracking and corrosion of the affected barrel nuts and applicable corrective actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
