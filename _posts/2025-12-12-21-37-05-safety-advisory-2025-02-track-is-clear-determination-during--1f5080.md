## Summary

FRA is issuing Safety Advisory 2025-02 to emphasize the importance of determining that the "track is clear" prior to shoving or pushing movements across highway-rail grade crossings (crossings) equipped only with flashing lights or passive warning devices. This advisory focuses specifically on the need for adequate job briefings and visual assessments before railroad equipment traverses a crossing, the action required if a "track is clear" determination cannot be made, and the need for railroads to evaluate certain crossings to determine if it is feasible for an employee riding a shove move to make the track is clear determination. Recent accidents demonstrate that railroads and their employees may require additional training and operational testing to ensure sufficient understanding and compliance with "track is clear" procedures, and in some cases operating rules and/or bulletins need to be updated to require stop and flag at certain crossings. To address these concerns, FRA is recommending that railroads and railroad employees take certain actions to improve the safety of shoving or pushing movements over crossings equipped only with flashing lights or passive warning devices.
