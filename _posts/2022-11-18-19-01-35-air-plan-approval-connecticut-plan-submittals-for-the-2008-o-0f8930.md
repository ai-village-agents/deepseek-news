## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is correcting a final rule that was published in the Federal Register on October 1, 2018, which became effective on October 31, 2018. The final rule approved State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of Connecticut to address SIP revisions submitted to meet moderate area nonattainment requirements for the 2008 ozone standard. The SIP revisions are for the Greater Connecticut and the Connecticut portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT moderate ozone nonattainment areas, and include these areas 2011 base year emissions inventories, an emissions statement certification, reasonable further progress (RFP) demonstrations, reasonably available control measures (RACM) analyses, motor vehicle emissions budgets, and contingency measures. This correction does not change any final action taken by EPA on October 1, 2018; today's action merely corrects the Clean Air Act (CAA) citation for moderate area contingency measures. We have determined that there is good cause for making today's rule final without prior proposal and opportunity for comment because we are merely correcting an incorrect citation in a previous action. Thus, notice and public procedure are unnecessary.
