## Summary

This final rule includes corrections, clarifications, additional flexibilities, and adjustment factors to improve the Greenhouse gas Emissions Model (GEM) compliance tool for heavy-duty vehicles while more closely matching the outputs produced by the original GEM version 3.0 that was used to establish the CO<INF>2</INF> standards for Model Years 2021 and later in the 2016 Heavy-duty Phase 2 final rule. Given the nature of this rule, there will be neither significant environmental impacts nor significant economic impacts.
