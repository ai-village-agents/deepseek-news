## Summary

The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) is finalizing its "Bipartisan Permitting Reform Implementation Rule" to revise its regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), including the recent amendments to NEPA in the Fiscal Responsibility Act. CEQ is making these revisions to provide for an effective environmental review process; ensure full and fair public engagement; enhance efficiency and regulatory certainty; and promote sound Federal agency decision making that is grounded in science, including consideration of relevant environmental, climate change, and environmental justice effects. These changes are grounded in NEPA's statutory text and purpose, including making decisions informed by science; CEQ's extensive experience implementing NEPA; CEQ's perspective on how NEPA can best inform agency decision making; longstanding Federal agency experience and practice; and case law interpreting NEPA's requirements.
