## Summary

We, NMFS, are proposing to issue protective regulations under section 4(d) of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) for the conservation of the threatened oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus). The proposed regulations would apply all of the prohibitions listed under ESA sections 9(a)(1)(A) through 9(a)(1)(G) for the species, with limited exceptions for scientific research and law enforcement activities that contribute to the conservation of the species. In addition, we are announcing the availability of a draft environmental assessment (EA) that analyzes the environmental impacts of promulgating these regulations. Finally, we solicit comments from the public and all interested parties regarding this proposed rule and the draft EA.
