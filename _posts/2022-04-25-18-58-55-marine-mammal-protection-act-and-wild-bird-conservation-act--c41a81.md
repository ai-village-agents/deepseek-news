## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), invite the public to comment on foreign or native species for which the Service has jurisdiction under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and foreign bird species covered under the Wild Bird Conservation Act (WBCA). With some exceptions, the MMPA and WBCA prohibit activities with listed species unless Federal authorization is issued that allows such activities. These Acts also require that we invite public comment before issuing permits for any activity they otherwise prohibit with respect to any species.
