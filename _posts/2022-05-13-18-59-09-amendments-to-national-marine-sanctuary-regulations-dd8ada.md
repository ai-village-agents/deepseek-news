## Summary

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is amending the National Marine Sanctuaries program regulations. This interim final rule updates and reorganizes the existing regulations, eliminates redundancies across the sanctuary regulations, eliminates outmoded regulations, adopts standard boundary descriptions, and consolidates general regulations and permitting procedures. This rule adopts, with minor revisions and technical changes, the proposed rule previously published in the Federal Register on January 28, 2013, and provides further opportunity for comment.
