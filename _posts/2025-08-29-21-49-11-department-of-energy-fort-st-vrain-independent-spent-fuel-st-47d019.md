## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) reviewed an application by the Department of Energy (DOE) for an amendment to Special Nuclear Materials (SNM) License No. SNM-2504, for the Fort St. Vrain (FSV) independent spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI) located in Platteville, Colorado. The requested amendment revises certain license conditions and technical specifications (TS) by adjusting references to relevant organizational components of DOE, correcting prior clerical drafting errors, and changing the description of a DOE official who is responsible for the operation and nuclear safety of the FSV ISFSI and for ensuring its compliance with certain conditions and requirements of the license and applicable regulations.
