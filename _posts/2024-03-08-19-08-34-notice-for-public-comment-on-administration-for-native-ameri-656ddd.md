## Summary

As part of the Durbin Feeling Native American Languages Act of 2022 (Durbin Feeling Act), the Administration for Native Americans (ANA) is tasked with developing a nationwide survey on Native languages, with the intent that the survey will be sent out and collected every 5 years. The survey will gather information from Tribal Governments and/or Native language community organization representatives to report about the language use, language learning, and unmet needs in the community. The law requires that the survey makers consult with Native American Tribes, traditional leaders, and representatives of Native American language communities, including Native Hawaiian and Pacific Island communities. The data collection will provide Tribal Nations, Native American language communities, and Congress with critical information about how Federal support can best help to revitalize and maintain Native languages.
