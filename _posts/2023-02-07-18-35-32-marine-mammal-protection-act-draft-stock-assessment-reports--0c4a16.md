## Summary

In accordance with the Marine Mammal Protection Act and its implementing regulations, we, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, have developed draft revised marine mammal stock assessment reports (SAR) for the Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) and for each of the three northern sea otter (Enhydra lutris kenyoni) stocks in Alaska. We invite comments on the four SARs from the public and from Federal, tribal, state, and local governments.
