## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Engine Alliance (EA) GP7270, GP7272, and GP7277 model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by a manufacturer investigation that revealed certain stages 7-9 compressor rotor spools were manufactured from a billet of material suspected of having foreign material embedded. This AD requires the replacement of the affected stages 7-9 compressor rotor spool. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
