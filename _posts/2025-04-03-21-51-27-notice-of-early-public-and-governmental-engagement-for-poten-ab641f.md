## Summary

The Grid Deployment Office (GDO) of the Department of Energy (DOE) is seeking public input and comment from Federal and State agencies, regional entities, Tribal and local governments, the public, and other interested parties on DOE's consideration of three potential National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors (NIETCs). On December 16, 2024, DOE published a Notice of Early Public and Governmental Engagement (notice) inviting input and comment on the possible scope of analysis, including environmental, cultural, or socioeconomic effects should DOE designate any of the potential NIETCs, and the contents of DOE's engagement framework, including appropriate methods and locations of future NIETC-specific meetings. DOE also invited any other relevant feedback. The notice provided an opportunity for submitting written comments, data, and information to DOE no later than February 14, 2025. DOE received requests to extend the public comment period, and in response DOE is reopening the public comment period through April 15, 2025.
