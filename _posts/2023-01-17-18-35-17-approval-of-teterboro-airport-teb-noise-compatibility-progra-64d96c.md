## Summary

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its findings for the noise compatibility program submitted by LGA, see supplementary information for details. On June 15, 2017, the FAA determined that the noise exposure maps submitted by TEB were in compliance with applicable requirements. On July 15, 2022, the FAA determined that the noise compatibility program submitted by TEB would be initiating final review for approval or disapproval. On January 10, 2023, the FAA approved the TEB noise compatibility program. The noise compatibility program contained 33 recommended measures, including 16 noise abatement measures, four land use measures, and 13 program management measures. Of the measures proposed, 23 were approved, four were approved as voluntary, three were disapproved, and three were determined to have no FAA action as continuations of existing mandatory practices at TEB. Six of the 16 noise abatement procedures proposed at LGA are related to new or revised flight procedures.
