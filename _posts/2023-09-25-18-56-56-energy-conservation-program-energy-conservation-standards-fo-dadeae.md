## Summary

On May 11, 2023, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") published a notice of proposed rulemaking ("NOPR"), in which DOE proposed new and amended energy conservation standards for automatic commercial ice makers. In this notification of data availability ("NODA"), DOE is updating its analysis for automatic commercial ice makers based on information DOE received related to harvest rate cutoffs in response to DOE's May 11, 2023 NOPR. DOE requests comments, data, and information regarding the updated analysis.
