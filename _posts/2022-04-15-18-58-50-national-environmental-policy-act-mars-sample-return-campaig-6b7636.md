## Summary

Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), as amended, the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA, and NASA's procedures for implementing NEPA, NASA will prepare a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) for the Mars Sample Return (MSR) Campaign; cooperating agencies for this effort include the U.S. Air Force (in accordance with, Environmental Impact Analysis Process), U.S. Army, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services--Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The PEIS will provide information related to the potential environmental impacts associated with the proposed return of Mars samples to Earth for scientific analysis. Potential impacts to be analyzed in the PEIS include those associated with ground disturbance from landing site preparation, and sample vehicle landing and recovery efforts with respect to natural, biological and cultural resources. NASA will also assess potential impacts to the human and natural environment associated with loss of containment of Mars sample materials.
