## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), located within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), announces that it is extending the March 31, 2020 deadline for submissions required under the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (FCLAA) and the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act (CSTHEA) for cigarette and smokeless tobacco products, respectively. CDC also announces that it is extending the deadline for ingredient reports for new products that are due at the time of first importation. Previous notices announced that ingredient reports are due annually on March 31, and/or upon initial importation of cigarettes and/or smokeless tobacco products. Due to the current public health response to COVID-19, CDC is not able to accept any ingredient submissions and will not be issuing Certificates of Compliance at this time. CDC is communicating this information to state government entities and will re-evaluate this approach as necessary.
