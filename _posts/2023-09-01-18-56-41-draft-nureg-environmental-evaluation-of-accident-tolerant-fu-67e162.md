## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing for public comment draft NUREG-2266, "Environmental Evaluation of Accident Tolerant Fuels with Increased Enrichment and Higher Burnup Levels." This study evaluates the reasonably foreseeable impacts of near-term accident tolerant fuel (ATF) technologies with increased enrichment and higher burnup levels to 8 wt% uranium-235 (U-235) and up to 80 GWd/MTU, respectively, on the uranium fuel cycle, transportation of fuel and waste, and decommissioning for light-water reactors (LWRs) (i.e., a bounding analysis).
