## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain DAHER AEROSPACE (DAHER) Model TBM 700 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of wear of the inner flap actuator drive nut. This AD requires cleaning and lubricating the internal actuator rods, measuring the play between the drive nuts and the internal actuator rods, and if any play is found, replacing the drive nuts. This AD also allows replacing the drive nuts with certain other design drive nuts as terminating action for the requirements. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
