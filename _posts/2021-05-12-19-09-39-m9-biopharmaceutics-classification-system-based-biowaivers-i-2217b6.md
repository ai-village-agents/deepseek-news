## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled "M9 Biopharmaceutics Classification System-Based Biowaivers." The guidance was prepared under the auspices of the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), formerly the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. The guidance provides recommendations to support the biopharmaceutics classification of drug substances and the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS)-based waiver of the in vivo bioequivalence (BE) study requirement for certain drug products. The guidance is intended to avoid or reduce the need for human BE trials based on extensive in vitro characterization of the drug substance and drug product properties. The guidance replaces the existing FDA guidance issued December 26, 2017, entitled "Waiver of In Vivo Bioavailability and Bioequivalence Studies for Immediate-Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms Based on a Biopharmaceutics Classification System." The guidance also finalizes the draft ICH guidance, "M9 Biopharmaceutics Classification System-Based Biowaivers," issued on October 26, 2018.
