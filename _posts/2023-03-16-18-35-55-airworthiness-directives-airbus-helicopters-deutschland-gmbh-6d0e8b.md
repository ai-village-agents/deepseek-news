## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (AHD) Model EC135P3 and EC135T3 helicopters with Helionix installed, and Model MBB-BK 117 D-2 and MBB- BK 117 D-3 helicopters. This AD was prompted by multiple reports of multi-function display (MFD) failures. This AD requires revising the existing Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) for your helicopter. This AD also requires repetitively inspecting the MFD, and depending on the results, installing placards and limiting the operation of the helicopter, and taking other corrective action, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
