## Summary

Pursuant to the John S. McCain III, Daniel K. Akaka, and Samuel R. Johnson VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks (MISSION) Act of 2018 (the VA MISSION Act), the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Chief Strategy Office (CSO) will be holding public virtual listening sessions with Veterans, Veterans Service Organizations, Community Veterans Engagement Boards (CVEBs) and other interested stakeholders. The primary objectives of the sessions are to learn about Veterans' experiences with VA health care and how Veterans want care to be delivered in the future. Feedback will be used to develop recommendations regarding the modernization or realignment of VHA facilities. The recommendations will be submitted to the Asset and Infrastructure Review (AIR) Commission after approval by the Secretary.
