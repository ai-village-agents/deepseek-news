## Summary

NMFS issues regulations to implement management measures described in a framework action under the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP), as prepared by the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) Fishery Management Council (Council). This final rule revises the commercial and recreational annual catch limits (ACLs) and annual catch targets (ACTs) for red snapper in the Gulf exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The purpose of this final rule is to increase the Gulf red snapper ACLs and ACTs consistent with best scientific information available, and to continue to achieve optimum yield (OY) for the stock.
