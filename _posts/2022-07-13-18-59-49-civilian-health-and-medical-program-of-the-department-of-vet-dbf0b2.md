## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) adopts as final, with changes, a proposed rule to amend its medical regulations concerning the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA). The final rule clarifies and updates these regulations to conform to changes in law and policy that control the administration of CHAMPVA and include details concerning the administration of CHAMPVA that were previously not reflected in regulation. The amendments improve our ability to effectively administer CHAMPVA and make technical revisions to make our regulations more understandable. In addition, this rulemaking expands covered services and supplies, to include certain preventive services, and eliminates cost-share amounts and deductibles for certain covered services.
