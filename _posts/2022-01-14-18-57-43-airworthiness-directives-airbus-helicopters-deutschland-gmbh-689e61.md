## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH Model MBB-BK 117 D-3 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of a main rotor (M/R) blade lead-lag damper in a tilted position. This proposed AD would require inspecting the Flex Control Unit (FCU), and corrective actions if necessary, as well as rework and re-identification of the bearing pin, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
