## Summary

The Regional Administrator, West Coast Region, NMFS, has made a preliminary determination that two Exempted Fishing Permit (EFP) applications warrant further consideration. Both applications are from the California Wetfish Producers Association and request an exemption from the expected prohibition on primary directed fishing for Pacific sardine during the 2023-2024 fishing year to collect Pacific sardine as part of industry-based scientific research. NMFS requests public comment on the applications.
