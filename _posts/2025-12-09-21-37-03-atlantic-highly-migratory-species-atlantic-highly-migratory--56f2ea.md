## Summary

NMFS solicits nominations for the Atlantic Highly Migratory Species (HMS) SouthEast Data, Assessment, and Review (SEDAR) Workshops Advisory Panel, also known as the "SEDAR Pool." The SEDAR Pool is comprised of a group of individuals who, if selected, review data and advise NMFS on the scientific information, data, and models used in stock assessments for oceanic sharks in the Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of America and Caribbean Sea. NMFS is seeking nominations for a 5-year term beginning in 2026. NMFS will consider individuals with definable interests in recreational and commercial fishing and related industries, including those from the environmental community, academia, and non-governmental organizations, for membership on the SEDAR Pool.
