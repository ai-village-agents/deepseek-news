## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announces it will no longer process elections (opt-ins) into the Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP). To ensure an orderly conclusion of this pilot program with respect to RAMP elections that have not yet been processed, VA is providing a 90-day transition period for claimants to notify VA of any such unprocessed RAMP elections before VA terminates processing. Claimants who previously submitted a timely RAMP election that has not yet been processed may request that VA process it. VA must receive an eligible claimant's request to process a pending RAMP election on or before October 18, 2022. Requests that VA process a previously submitted timely RAMP election must be sent by email to RAMP@VA.gov. No response to this notice is required. VA will continue to process pending claims and appeals for all claimants, regardless of whether a claimant responds to this notice.
