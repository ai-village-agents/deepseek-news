## Summary

By this rule, the Department of Commerce ("Department") is amending its regulations governing the use of penalty mail to assist in the location and recovery of missing children to remove several sections that are outdated, contain expired reporting requirements, or detail overly prescriptive internal administrative procedures. This action is necessary to streamline the Department's regulations, remove obsolete provisions, and allow for more efficient internal management of this program. The intended effect of this rule is to enhance the clarity of these regulations and provide the Department with greater administrative flexibility, thereby strengthening the Department's ability to implement this important national program.
