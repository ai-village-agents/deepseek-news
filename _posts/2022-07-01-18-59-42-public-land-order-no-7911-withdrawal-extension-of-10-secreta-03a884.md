## Summary

This Order extends the duration of the withdrawals created by 10 Secretary's Orders (SOs), 2 Public Land Orders (PLOs), and 1 Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Order, as modified by PLO No. 7262, affecting 145,644.03 acres of Federal lands from location and entry under the United States mining laws, but not from the general land laws or mineral leasing laws, for a 20-year period. The withdrawal extension is necessary to continue protection of the following Bureau of Reclamation Projects: Boulder Canyon, Colorado River Storage, Senator Wash Pump Storage, and Yuma Reclamation, which by the terms of the modification made by PLO 7262 would otherwise expire on July 6, 2022. Additionally, this Order corrects an error in labeling a project area as the All- American Canal Project, which appeared in a Federal Register notice on March 11, 2022.
