## Summary

Reviews of products and services help to promote fair, transparent, and competitive markets. When firms frustrate the ability of consumers to post honest reviews of products and services that they use, they may be engaged in conduct prohibited by the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA). The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) is issuing this bulletin to remind regulated entities of the CFPA's requirements and explain how the Bureau intends to exercise its enforcement and supervisory authorities on this issue.
