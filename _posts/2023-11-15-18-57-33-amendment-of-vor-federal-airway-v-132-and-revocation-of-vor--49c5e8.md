## Summary

This action proposes to amend Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airway V-132 and revoke VOR Federal airways V-131, V-307, and V-350. The FAA is proposing this action due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Chanute, KS (CNU), VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) navigational aid (NAVAID). The Chanute VOR is being decommissioned in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
