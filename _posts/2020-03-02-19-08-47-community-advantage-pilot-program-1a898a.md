## Summary

The Community Advantage ("CA") Pilot Program is a pilot program to increase SBA-guaranteed loans to small businesses in underserved areas. The Small Business Administration ("SBA" or "Agency") continues to refine and improve the design of the CA Pilot Program. To support SBA's commitment to expanding access to capital for small businesses and entrepreneurs in underserved markets, SBA is issuing this Notice to revise the requirements for refinancing non-SBA guaranteed, same institution debt in certain circumstances. Further, SBA is revising the number of loans a CA Lender must make before it can begin processing loans under its delegated authority. Finally, SBA is providing guidance on the expiration and process for renewal of CA Lenders' Loan Guaranty Agreements (SBA Form 750CA).
