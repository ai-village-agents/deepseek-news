## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is extending the comment period for two proposed rules that appeared in the Federal Register of May 4, 2022, which are a tobacco product standard that would prohibit menthol as a characterizing flavor in cigarettes ("Tobacco Product Standard for Menthol in Cigarettes"; Docket No. FDA-2021-N-1349) and a tobacco product standard that would prohibit characterizing flavors (other than tobacco) in all cigars ("Tobacco Product Standard for Characterizing Flavors in Cigars"; Docket No. FDA-2021-N-1309). The Agency is taking this action in response to requests for an extension to allow interested persons additional time to submit comments.
