## Summary

In accordance with the Presidential directive as expressed in the memorandum of January 20, 2021 from the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff, entitled "Regulatory Freeze Pending Review," HUD is reviewing all its pending proposed rules to determine which should move forward. HUD has identified a proposed rule, "Housing and Community Development of Act 1980: Verification of Eligible Status" that is inconsistent with the Executive order entitled "Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government" and the Executive order entitled "Restoring Faith in Our Legal Immigration Systems and Strengthening Integration and Inclusion Efforts for New Americans." This document informs the public that HUD has determined not to pursue this proposed rule previously published in the Federal Register. HUD will proceed to formally withdraw the rule from HUD's upcoming Spring 2021 Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions.
