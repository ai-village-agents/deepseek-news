## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Allied Ag Cat Productions, Inc. (Allied Ag Cat) Model G-164A and G-164B airplanes with certain supplemental type certificates (STCs) installed. This AD was prompted by an accident involving an Allied Ag Cat Model G- 164B airplane where the airplane's propeller pitch control (PPC) linkage detached from the PPC of the engine and resulted in an accident that significantly damaged the airplane and injured the pilot. This AD requires installing a secondary retention feature (bolt, washer, and safety wire) on the PPC lever and the PPC assembly. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
