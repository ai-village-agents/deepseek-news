## Summary

Consistent with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 the U.S. International Trade Commission (Commission) has submitted a proposal for the collection of information to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval. The proposed information collection is a three-year extension of the current generic clearance (approved by OMB under Control No. 3117-0016) under which the Commission can issue information collections for import injury investigations and reviews that it is required to conduct under the Tariff Act of 1930, the Trade Act of 1974, and other trade remedy statutes that require or authorize the Commission to make findings or determinations. These investigations and reviews include: antidumping duty, countervailing duty, safeguards, other import competition, market disruption, interference with programs of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and cross-border long-haul trucking. A full list of all the investigations and reviews associated with this generic clearance and their associated statutory authorities is available in the Commission's supporting statement to this Federal Register notice. Any comments submitted to OMB on the proposed information collection should be specific, indicating which part of the questionnaires or study plan are objectionable, describing the issue in detail, and including specific revisions or language changes. The Commission did not receive any comments in response to the 60-day notice that it published in the Federal Register on January 5, 2023.
