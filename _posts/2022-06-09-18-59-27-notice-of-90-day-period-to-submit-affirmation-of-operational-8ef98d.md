## Summary

In this document, the International Bureau (Bureau) provides the following notice to operators of certain incumbent FSS C-band earth station antennas recently reported to the Bureau by RSM US LLP (RSM), the C-band Relocation Coordinator, on behalf of incumbent C-band satellite operators: Failure to submit a filing to the Bureau by no later than 90 days after the release of the Bureau's Public Notice (i.e., by August 10, 2022) affirming the continued operation of the earth station antennas reported to the Bureau as inactive and the intent to participate in the C-band transition will result in a Bureau announcement that those authorizations identified as inactive in the Appendix attached to the Bureau's Public Notice have automatically terminated by operation of rule, and that those authorizations will be terminated in IBFS and removed from the incumbent earth station list. According to RSM, each antenna included in the Appendix to the Bureau's Public Notice was reported by their earth station operator to RSM or a satellite operator as no longer receiving service from a C-band satellite even though the FCC's International Bureau Filing System (IBFS) continues to include the antenna as active.
