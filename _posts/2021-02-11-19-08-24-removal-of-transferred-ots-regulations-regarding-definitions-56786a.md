## Summary

In order to streamline FDIC regulations, the FDIC proposes to rescind and remove from the Code of Federal Regulations rules entitled Definitions for Regulations Affecting All State Savings Associations that were transferred to the FDIC from the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) on July 21, 2011, in connection with the implementation of Title III of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). The effective date of rescinding and removing these regulations would be coordinated with the rescission and removal of the other remaining subparts.
