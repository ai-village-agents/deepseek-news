## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("Commission" or "CFTC") is adopting final rules amending its part 38 regulations to address the potential risk of a designated contract market's ("DCM") trading platform experiencing a market disruption or system anomaly due to electronic trading. The final rules set forth three principles applicable to DCMs concerning: The implementation of exchange rules applicable to market participants to prevent, detect, and mitigate market disruptions and system anomalies associated with electronic trading; the implementation of exchange-based pre-trade risk controls for all electronic orders; and the prompt notification of Commission staff by DCMs of any significant market disruptions on their electronic trading platforms. In addition, the final rules include acceptable practices ("Acceptable Practices"), which provide that a DCM can comply with these principles by adopting and implementing rules and risk controls reasonably designed to prevent, detect, and mitigate market disruptions and system anomalies associated with electronic trading.
