## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on October 3, 2023. The collection involves information from commercial air tour operators on the numbers and types of air tours over national park units. The information collected is necessary for the FAA and the National Park Service to track air tour operations over national parks and as background information in the development of air tour management plans and voluntary agreements for purposes of addressing any potential significant impacts from commercial air tour operations on the natural or cultural resources or visitor experience at the parks.
