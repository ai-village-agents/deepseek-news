## Summary

As the Biden-Harris Administration implements the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), we seek to maximize the use of American made products and materials in all federally funded projects while also successfully delivering a wide range of critical infrastructure projects for States, local communities, counties, Tribal nations and farms, factories and businesses across the U.S. In order to deliver projects and meaningful results while ensuring robust adoption of Buy America standards, the U.S. Department of Transportation ("DOT" or "Department") is establishing a temporary public interest waiver for construction materials for a period of 180 days beginning on May 14, 2022 and expiring on November 10, 2022. DOT is establishing this transitional waiver to prepare for compliance with the new Made in America standards for construction materials. During this time period, DOT expects States, industry, and other partners to begin developing procedures to document compliance. DOT will continue its engagement through the waiver period to help facilitate the creation of robust enforcement and compliance mechanisms and to rapidly encourage domestic sourcing of construction materials for transportation infrastructure improvements.
