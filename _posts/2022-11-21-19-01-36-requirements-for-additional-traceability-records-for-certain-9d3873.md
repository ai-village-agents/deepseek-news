## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is issuing a final rule establishing additional recordkeeping requirements for persons who manufacture, process, pack, or hold foods the Agency has designated for inclusion on the Food Traceability List (FTL). The final rule adopts provisions requiring these entities to maintain records containing information on critical tracking events in the supply chain for these designated foods, such as initially packing, shipping, receiving, and transforming these foods. The requirements established in the final rule will help the Agency rapidly and effectively identify recipients of foods to prevent or mitigate foodborne illness outbreaks and address credible threats of serious adverse health consequences or death resulting from foods being adulterated or misbranded. We are issuing this regulation in accordance with the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA).
