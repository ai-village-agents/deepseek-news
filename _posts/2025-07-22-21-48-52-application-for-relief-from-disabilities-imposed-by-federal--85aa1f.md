## Summary

The Department of Justice ("the Department") proposes to implement criteria to guide determinations for granting relief from disabilities imposed by Federal laws with respect to the acquisition, receipt, transfer, shipment, transportation, or possession of firearms. In accordance with certain firearms laws and the Second Amendment of the Constitution, the criteria are designed to ensure the fundamental right of the people to keep and bear arms is not unduly infringed, that those granted relief are not likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety, and that granting such relief would not be contrary to the public interest.
