## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500- 1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports that the interface pin of the secondary load path in the upper gimbal of the horizontal stabilizer trim actuator (HSTA) was incorrectly installed. This AD requires a detailed visual inspection of the interface pin of the HSTA to determine if the interface pin is incorrectly installed, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
