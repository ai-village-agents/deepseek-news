## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is extending the comment period for the color additive petition for which we published a notice of filing in the Federal Register on May 3, 2023. In the notice, FDA requested comments on a filed color additive petition submitted by Environmental Defense Fund, et al., proposing that FDA repeal the color additive regulation providing for the use of titanium dioxide in foods. We are taking this action in response to requests for an extension to allow interested persons additional time to submit comments.
