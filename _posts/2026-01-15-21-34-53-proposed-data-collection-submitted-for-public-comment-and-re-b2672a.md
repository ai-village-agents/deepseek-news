## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Poison Center Collaborations for Public Health Emergencies (PCCPHE). PCCPHE creates a timely mechanism which will allow a network of poison centers, supported by CDC, to obtain critical exposure and health information during a public health emergency.
