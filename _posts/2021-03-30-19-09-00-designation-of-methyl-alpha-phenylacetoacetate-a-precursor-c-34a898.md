## Summary

The Drug Enforcement Administration is proposing the control of the chemical methyl alpha-phenylacetoacetate (also known as MAPA; methyl 3-oxo-2-phenylbutanoate; methyl 2-phenylacetoacetate; [alpha]- acetyl-benzeneacetic acid, methyl ester; and CAS Number: 16648-44-5) and its optical isomers as a list I chemical under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Methyl alpha-phenylacetoacetate is used in clandestine laboratories to illicitly manufacture the schedule II controlled substances phenylacetone (also known as phenyl-2-propanone or P2P), methamphetamine, and amphetamine and is important to the manufacture of these controlled substances. If finalized, this action would subject handlers of methyl alpha-phenylacetoacetate to the chemical regulatory provisions of the CSA and its implementing regulations. This rulemaking does not establish a threshold for domestic and international transactions of methyl alpha- phenylacetoacetate. As such, all transactions of chemical mixtures containing methyl alpha-phenylacetoacetate would be regulated at any concentration and would be subject to control under the CSA.
