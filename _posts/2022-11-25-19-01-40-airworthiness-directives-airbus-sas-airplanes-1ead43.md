## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-14- 08, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A319-151N, A319-153N, A319- 171N, A320-251N, A320-252N, A320-273N, A321-251N, A321-251NX, A321- 252N, A321-252NX, A321-253N, A321-253NX, A321-271N, A321-271NX, A321- 272N, and A321-272NX airplanes. AD 2021-14-08 required revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to include a procedure to reinforce the airspeed check during the take-off phase and provide instructions to abort take-off in certain cases. This AD was prompted by the development of a software update to the elevator aileron computer (ELAC) to address the unsafe condition. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2021-14-08 and requires replacing each affected ELAC and removing the AFM revision required by AD 2021-14-08, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also prohibits the installation of affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
