## Summary

This proposal invites comments on the modification of the membership of the Softwood Lumber Board (Board) established under the Softwood Lumber Research, Promotion, Consumer Education and Industry Information Order (Order). This action would modify the membership of the Board by adding the alternate position for certain seats and a public member. In addition, Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) numbers for softwood lumber would be updated with the latest numbers from the U.S. International Trade Commission. The Board administers the Order with oversight by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
