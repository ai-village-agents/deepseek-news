# Importation of Sheep, Goats, and Certain Other Ruminants; Correction

## Summary

The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service recently issued a final rule that was published in the Federal Register on December 3, 2021. The rule amended the regulations governing the importation of animals and animal products to revise conditions for the importation of live sheep, goats, and certain other non-bovine ruminants, and products derived from sheep and goats, with regard to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy and scrapie. The final rule improperly worded an amendatory instruction that resulted in the unintentional duplication of a sentence and left an obsolete section number in the regulations for the location of the requirements for the importation of sheep and goats from Canada for immediate slaughter. This document corrects that inadvertent error and amends the regulations with the proper wording.
