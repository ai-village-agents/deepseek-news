## Summary

We, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce receipt of an application from the City of Gulf Shores, Alabama (applicant), to modify incidental take permit TE84363C-0 (ITP) under the Endangered Species Act. The ITP authorizes take of the federally listed Alabama beach mouse incidental to construction in Gulf Shores, Alabama. We request public comment on the application, which includes the applicant's proposed modified habitat conservation plan (HCP), and the Service's preliminary determination that the HCP qualifies as "low- effect," categorically excluded, under the National Environmental Policy Act. To make this determination, we used our environmental action statement and low-effect screening form, both of which are also available for public review.
