## Summary

FMCSA announces that it has received an application from the American Pyrotechnics Association (APA) requesting exemptions from certain hours of service (HOS) regulations. Previous similar exemptions expired on July 8, 2021, and APA now requests the exemptions on behalf of 45 member companies. The exemptions would allow drivers to exclude off-duty and sleeper berth time of any length from the calculation of the 14-hour limit and to use paper records of duty status (RODS) in lieu of an electronic logging device (ELD) during the designated Independence Day periods. The requests are for the transportation of pyrotechnics from June 28 through July 8 of every year from 2022 through 2026.
