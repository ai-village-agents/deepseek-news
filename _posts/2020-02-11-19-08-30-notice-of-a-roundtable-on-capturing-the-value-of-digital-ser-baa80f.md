The Industry and Analysis (I&A) unit of the International Trade Administration (ITA) of the Department of Commerce is leading an effort to develop a methodology to calculate the value of machinery- based digital services in international trade. Better understanding of the true value of digital services in the machinery sector will allow the United States Government to more effectively advocate for U.S. industry in trade negotiations and international dialogues. Through this notice, I&A announces a roundtable to facilitate a discussion with industry stakeholders and experts as an important step in improving the Department's understanding of the value of digital services in industrial machinery.
