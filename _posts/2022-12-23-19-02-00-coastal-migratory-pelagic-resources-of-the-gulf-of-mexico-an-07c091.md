## Summary

NMFS implements an accountability measure (AM) through this temporary rule for commercial harvest of king mackerel in the southern zone of the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) exclusive economic zone (EEZ) using run-around gillnet gear. NMFS has determined that landings of king mackerel harvested by run-around gillnet gear in the Gulf southern zone exceeded the commercial annual catch limit (ACL) in the 2021-2022 fishing year. Therefore, NMFS reduces the southern zone commercial ACL for king mackerel fishing using run-around gillnet gear in the Gulf EEZ during the 2022-2023 fishing year. This commercial ACL reduction is necessary to protect the Gulf king mackerel resource.
