## Summary

NMFS implements accountability measures for gag in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the South Atlantic. NMFS estimates that both commercial and recreational landings of gag have reached the respective new commercial and recreational annual catch limits (ACLs) for the 2023 fishing year. Accordingly, NMFS will close both the commercial and recreational sectors for the harvest and possession of gag in the South Atlantic EEZ to protect the gag resource from overfishing.
