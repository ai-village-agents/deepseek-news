## Summary

This action finalizes the residual risk and technology review (RTR) conducted for the Asphalt Processing and Asphalt Roofing Manufacturing source categories regulated under national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP). In addition, we are taking final action to: Correct and clarify regulatory provisions related to emissions during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM); revise monitoring requirements for a control device used to comply with the particulate matter (PM) standards; add requirements for periodic performance testing; add electronic reporting of performance test results and reports, performance evaluation reports, compliance reports, and Notification of Compliance Status (NOCS) reports; and include other technical corrections to improve consistency and clarity. We are making no revisions to the numerical emission limits based on the residual risk analysis or technology review. Although these amendments are not anticipated to result in reductions in emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAP), they will improve compliance and implementation of the rule.
