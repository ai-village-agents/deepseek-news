## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of erucamide (CAS Reg. No. 112-84-5) when used as an inert ingredient (lubricant) in pesticide formulations when applied on the raw agricultural commodities honey and honeycomb. Veto- Pharma SAS submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of erucamide, when used in accordance with the terms of this exemption.
