## Summary

This final rule approves sector operations plans and contracts, including 18 regulatory exemptions for fishing years 2023 and 2024. This final rule also allocates Northeast multispecies annual catch entitlements to approved groundfish sectors for fishing year 2023; this includes default specifications for nine stocks. This action is intended to allow limited access permit holders to continue to operate sectors, as authorized under the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan, and to exempt sectors from certain effort control regulations to improve the efficiency and economics of sector vessels. Approval of sector operations plans and contracts is necessary to allocate annual catch entitlements to the sectors in order for sectors to operate.
