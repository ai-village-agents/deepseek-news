## Summary

This notice sets forth the reasons for the denial of a defect petition, DP23-003, submitted on July 2, 2023, by Aldelberto A. Cordova (the "Petitioner") to NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation (ODI). The petition requests that NHTSA (the "Agency") investigate an alleged defect in the "ISG 48-volt on-board electrical system," which resulted in a warning light illumination and an inability to start the Petitioner's 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLC300. The Petitioner further requested a recall for 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLC300 vehicles based on this issue. After conducting a technical review of the Petitioner's submissions, reviewing complaints related to MY 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLC300 warning light illumination as well as the inability to start a vehicle, and reviewing information provided by Mercedes-Benz regarding the ISG 48-volt system, NHTSA has concluded that the issues raised by the petition do not warrant a defect investigation at this time. Accordingly, the Agency has denied the petition.
