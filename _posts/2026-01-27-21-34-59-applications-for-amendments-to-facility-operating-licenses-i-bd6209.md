## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC, the Commission) received, and is considering approval of, two requests to amend operating licenses. The license amendment requests are for Oconee Nuclear Station, Units 1, 2, and 3, and Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2. For each amendment request, the NRC proposes to determine that it involves no significant hazards consideration (NSHC). Because each amendment request contains sensitive unclassified non- safeguards information (SUNSI), the NRC is issuing an order imposing procedures to obtain access to SUNSI for contention preparation by persons who file a hearing request or a petition for leave to intervene.
