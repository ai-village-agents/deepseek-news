The medical device current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements, previously in the quality system regulation (QS regulation) and now the quality management system regulation (QMSR), have been amended effective February 2, 2026, to align more closely with the international consensus standard for devices by incorporating by reference an international standard specific for device quality management systems. This draft guidance document is intended to assist FDA staff and medical device manufacturers in understanding FDA expectations about preparing and maintaining a Quality Management System (QMS) and providing the information required to be included in certain marketing submissions regarding a QMS, in line with the QMSR. This draft guidance is not final nor is it for implementation at this time.
