## Summary

The Department proposes to amend its rule regarding minor passport applications to allow a non-applying parent to sign the statement of consent before a notary public or a passport specialist at one of the public passport agency/center counters located within the United States. Department of State Form DS-3053, which is used to obtain the written consent from the parent or legal guardian of a minor passport applicant when they cannot be present at the time the application is executed, is being revised to be consistent with this rulemaking. This proposal also amends the rule by removing from the list of acceptable documentary evidence of sole authority/custody a Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA) listing only the applying parent. Finally, this rulemaking updates the authority citation for the regulations.
