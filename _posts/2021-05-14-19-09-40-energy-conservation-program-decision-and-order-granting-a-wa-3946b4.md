## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") gives notification of a Decision and Order (Case Number 2019-009) that grants to CellarPro Cooling Systems ("CellarPro") a waiver from specified portions of the DOE test procedure for determining the energy efficiency of specified walk-in wine cellar refrigeration systems. Due to the design of CellarPro's specific basic models of walk-in wine cellar refrigeration systems, the current test procedure evaluates such models in a manner that is unrepresentative of their energy use. Under the Decision and Order, CellarPro is required to test and rate the specified basic models of its walk-in cellar refrigeration systems in accordance with the alternate test procedure set forth in the Decision and Order.
