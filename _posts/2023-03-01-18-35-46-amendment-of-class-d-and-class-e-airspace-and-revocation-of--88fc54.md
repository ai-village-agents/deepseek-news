## Summary

This action proposes to amend Class D airspace, remove Class E airspace designated as an extension to a Class D surface area, establish a Class D airspace extension, and amend Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Quantico MCAF (Turner Field), Quantico, VA, as an airspace evaluation determined an update is necessary. In addition, this action would remove the Brooke Very High-Frequency Omnidirectional Range Collocated Tactical Air (VORTAC) from the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface in the legal description, remove the extension to the south, and increases the radius of the Class E airspace. This action would also update the airport's geographic coordinates and replace the terms Notice to Airmen with Notice to Air Missions and Airport/Facility Directory with Chart Supplement in the descriptions.
