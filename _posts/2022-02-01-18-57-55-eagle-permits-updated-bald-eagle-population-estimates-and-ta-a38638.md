## Summary

In December 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service, or we) completed a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) wherein we evaluated biological data to establish maximum take limits for permits to take bald eagles in each of six eagle management units in the United States. In the PEIS, we committed to reevaluate biological data and reassess the take limits no less than once every 6 years. This notice is to inform the public that we have reviewed recent data and, using updated population and demographic models, are revising take limits for bald eagles effective immediately.
