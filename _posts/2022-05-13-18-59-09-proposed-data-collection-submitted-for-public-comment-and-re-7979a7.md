This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled National HIV Behavioral Surveillance System (NHBS). NHBS collects standardized HIV-related behavioral data from persons at risk for HIV, systematically selected from 20 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) throughout the United States.
