## Summary

As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) requests comments on a request for approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for a new information collection. The proposed collection is a bathtub slip resistance study to support work on a voluntary Safety Standard for Bathtub and Shower Structure. Before CPSC can collect this information from the public, it must solicit public comment on this proposed collection of information and receive OMB approval. This notice describes the collection of information for which CPSC intends to seek OMB approval.
