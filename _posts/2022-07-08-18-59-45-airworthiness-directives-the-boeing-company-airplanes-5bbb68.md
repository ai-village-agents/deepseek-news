## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-24- 10, which applied to certain The Boeing Company Model 757-200, -200PF, and -300 series airplanes. AD 2017-24-10 required repetitive inspections for any cracking of a certain fuselage frame inner chord; identification of the material of a certain fuselage frame inner chord for certain airplanes; and applicable corrective actions. This AD was prompted by reports of cracking found at a certain fuselage frame inner chord. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2017-24-10, adds airplanes, and requires new inspection types in certain areas, an expanded inspection area, additional inspections, and applicable corrective actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
