## Summary

NMFS announces the initiation of a 5-year review for three foreign corals (Cantharellus noumeae, Siderastrea glynni, and Tubastraea floreana). NMFS is required by the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to conduct 5-year reviews to ensure that the listing classifications of species are accurate. The 5-year review must be based on the best scientific and commercial data available at the time of the review. We request submission of any such information on these three coral species, particularly information on the status, threats, and recovery of the species that has become available since their listing, effective November 6, 2015 (80 FR 60560).
