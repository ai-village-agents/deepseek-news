## Summary

This notice informs the public of the opportunity to provide input on the self-assessment report created in support of the United States' participation in the Open Government Partnership (OGP). This input will be considered as GSA Office of Government-wide Policy finalizes the self-assessment prior to submission to the OGP. The United States has been a committed member of the Open Government Partnership since its inception, actively participating in the global effort to promote transparent, participative, and accountable governance. As part of this ongoing commitment, the United States is in the process of implementing its 5th Open Government National Action Plan (NAP 5), which outlines 36 commitments to further advance open government principles domestically and internationally. In accordance with OGP recommendations, the U.S. is conducting a mid-term self- assessment of the current NAP 5. This assessment serves as an essential tool for both self-reflection and planning, enabling the identification of achievements, challenges, and areas for improvement.
