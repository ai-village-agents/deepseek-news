## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 787-8 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of failure of a wing strut leak test due to a missing bolt on the firewall. This AD requires a one-time leak test of the strut upper spar areas for the left and right wing struts, and corrective action if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
