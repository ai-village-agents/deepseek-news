## Summary

In prior notices, the U.S. Trade Representative modified the actions in the Section 301 investigation of China's acts, policies, and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation by excluding from additional duties certain products of China. There are currently 178 effective exclusions. USTR has extended these exclusions several times, including by providing a recent 90-day extension to further extend the exclusions through November 29, 2025. USTR invites public comment on whether any of the 178 effective exclusions warrant further extension beyond November 29, 2025.
