## Summary

This notice describes a new effort designed to enhance the security of our Southwest Border (SWB) by reducing the number of encounters of Cuban nationals crossing the border without authorization, as the U.S. Government continues to implement its broader, multi-pronged and regional strategy to address the challenges posed by a surge in migration. Cubans who do not avail themselves of this new process, and instead enter the United States without authorization between ports of entry (POEs), generally are subject to removal--including to third countries, such as Mexico. As part of this effort, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is implementing a process--modeled on the successful Uniting for Ukraine (U4U) and Process for Venezuelans--for certain Cuban nationals to lawfully enter the United States in a safe and orderly manner and be considered for a case-by-case determination of parole. To be eligible, individuals must have a supporter in the United States who agrees to provide financial support for the duration of the beneficiary's parole period, pass national security and public safety vetting, and fly at their own expense to an interior POE, rather than entering at a land POE. Individuals are ineligible for this process if they have been ordered removed from the United States within the prior five years; have entered unauthorized into the United States between POEs, Mexico, or Panama after the date of this notice's publication, with an exception for individuals permitted a single instance of voluntary departure or withdrawal of their application for admission to still maintain their eligibility for this process; or are otherwise deemed not to merit a favorable exercise of discretion.
