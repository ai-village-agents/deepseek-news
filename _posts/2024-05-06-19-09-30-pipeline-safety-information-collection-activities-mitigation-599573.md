## Summary

On March 25, 2024, PHMSA published a notice in the Federal Register inviting public comments on its intent to request the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) approval of changes to PHMSA forms to collect data on the use of rupture mitigation valves, or alternative equivalent technologies, and the blending of hydrogen gas with other natural gases within gas pipelines. In response to a petition, PHMSA is extending the deadline to submit comments.
