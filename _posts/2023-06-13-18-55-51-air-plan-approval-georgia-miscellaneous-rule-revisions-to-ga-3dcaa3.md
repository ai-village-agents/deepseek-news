## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve changes to the Georgia State Implementation Plan (SIP), submitted by the State of Georgia through the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (GA EPD) via a letter dated November 4, 2021. The SIP revision revises Georgia's Stage I vapor recovery rules primarily by removing outdated references and making several clarifying edits. The revision also updates several definitions and makes two substantive changes. EPA is proposing to approve these changes pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act).
