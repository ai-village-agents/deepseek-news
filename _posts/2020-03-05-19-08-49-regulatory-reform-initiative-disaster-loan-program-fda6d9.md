## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is removing from the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 20 regulations that are no longer necessary because the programs they govern are no longer in effect. The rule will remove all regulations applicable to two subparts: Pre- Disaster Mitigation Loans and Economic Injury Disaster Loans as a Result of the September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks. The removal of these regulations will assist the public by simplifying SBA's regulations in the CFR.
