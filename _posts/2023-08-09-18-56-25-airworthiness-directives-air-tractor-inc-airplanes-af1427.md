## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Air Tractor, Inc. (Air Tractor) Model AT-802 and AT-802A airplanes that have Wipaire Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) No. SA01795CH installed. This AD was prompted by reports of cracks found in the forward horizontal stabilizer spar where the vertical finlets tie to the horizontal tail forward spar. This AD requires repetitively inspecting both the left and right forward horizontal stabilizer spars for cracks and replacing any forward horizontal stabilizer spar found cracked. This AD also requires reporting inspection results to the FAA. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
