## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve revisions to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the State of Missouri related to the control of emissions during petroleum liquid storage, loading and transfer in the Kansas City metropolitan area. The revisions include adding incorporations by reference to other state rules, adding definitions specific to the rule, revising unnecessarily restrictive or duplicative language, and making administrative wording changes. These revisions do not impact the stringency of the SIP or have an adverse effect on air quality. The EPA's final approval of this rule revision is being done in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
