## Summary

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (hereinafter, Service or we) proposes special migratory bird hunting regulations for certain Tribes on Federal Indian reservations, off-reservation trust lands, and ceded lands for the 2021-22 migratory bird hunting season. In issuing this proposed rule, we followed guidelines for a regulatory process that recognizes the reserved hunting rights and management authority of Indian Tribes while also ensuring that the migratory game bird resource receives necessary protection.
