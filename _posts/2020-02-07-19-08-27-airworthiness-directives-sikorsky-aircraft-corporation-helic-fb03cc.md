## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (Sikorsky) Model S-70, S-70A, S- 70C, S-70C(M), and S-70C(M1) helicopters. This AD was prompted by four incidents of disbonding between the tail rotor (T/R) blade pitch horn and the torque tube. This AD requires recurring visual and tap inspections of the T/R blade, and depending on the outcome, replacing the T/R blade. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
