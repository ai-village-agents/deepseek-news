## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to determine that the Imperial County, California fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) nonattainment area ("Imperial PM<INF>2.5</INF> nonattainment area") attained the 2012 annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS or "standard") by its December 31, 2021 "Moderate" area attainment date. This proposed determination is based upon ambient air quality monitoring data from 2019 through 2021. We are also proposing to make a clean data determination (CDD) based on our determination that preliminary air quality monitoring data from 2022 indicate the Imperial PM<INF>2.5</INF> nonattainment area continues to attain the 2012 annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS. If we finalize this CDD, certain Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements that apply to the Imperial County Air Pollution Control District (ICAPCD or "District") will be suspended for so long as the area continues to meet the 2012 annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS. The area will remain designated as nonattainment for the 2012 annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS. The EPA is also proposing to approve a revision to California's state implementation plan (SIP) consisting of the 2012 emissions inventory for the Imperial PM<INF>2.5</INF> nonattainment area, submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB or "State") on July 18, 2018.
