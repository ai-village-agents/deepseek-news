# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Airbus Helicopters Model SA330J helicopters, all serial numbers. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of the failure of the lower bearing cage of the main rotor hub (MRH) flapping hinges and of the presence of metallic particles at the bottom of a drag hinge. This proposed AD would require repetitive inspections of the MRH chip detectors, or for helicopters not equipped with chip detectors, repetitive inspections of the oil for contamination by metallic particles, and corrective actions if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
