## Summary

We, the Fish and Wildlife Service, announce receipt of an application from Monroe County (applicant) for a renewal of incidental take permit (ITP) under the Endangered Species Act. If granted, the expiration date of the existing ITP, which authorizes take of the Florida Key deer, the Lower Keys marsh rabbit, and the eastern indigo snake incidental to commercial and residential construction in Monroe County, Florida, would be extended for an additional 3 years. The applicant is seeking an extension of the ITP expiration date from June 30, 2023, to June 30, 2026. The application for renewal does not include a request to increase the amount of take authorized by the ITP or to modify the covered activities under the ITP and the associated habitat conservation plan (HCP). We request public comment on the application, which includes the applicant's existing HCP and the Service's preliminary determination that this ITP renewal qualifies as "low-effect," categorically excluded, under the National Environmental Policy Act. To make this determination, we used our environmental action statement and low-effect screening form, both of which are also available for public review.
