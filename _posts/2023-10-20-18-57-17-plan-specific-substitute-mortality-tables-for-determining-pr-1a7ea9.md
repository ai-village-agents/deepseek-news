## Summary

This document sets forth proposed regulations that would update the requirements that a plan sponsor of a single-employer defined benefit plan must meet to obtain IRS approval to use mortality tables specific to the plan in calculating present value for minimum funding purposes (as a substitute for the generally applicable mortality tables). These regulations would affect participants in, beneficiaries of, employers maintaining, and administrators of certain retirement plans.
