## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary regulated navigational area (RNA) for navigable waters of Oregon Inlet Channel. Due to severe shoaling in the Oregon Inlet Channel, the navigational channel will be moved until shoaling can be mitigated by dredging crews. The new, temporary, channel through the Marc Basnight Bridge may not be suitable for vessels of 100 gross tons (GT) or greater. This temporary RNA is needed to protect personnel, vessels, bridge infrastructure, and the marine environment from potential hazards associated with the transit of vessels 100 GT or greater until the original channel can be restored. Transit of vessels 100 GT or greater through this area is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port (COTP) North Carolina or designated representative.
