## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Model RB211-524H-36 and RB211-524H-T-36 engines. This AD was prompted by reports of engine surges and a subsequent investigation which found that the surges may have been caused by material loss on the high-pressure compressor (HPC) stage 1 and stage 2 rotor path liners. This AD requires borescope inspections (BSIs) of the HPC stage 1 and stage 2 rotor path liners for material loss, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
