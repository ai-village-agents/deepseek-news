## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is codifying product performance data requirements to support registration of pesticidal products claiming efficacy against three categories of invertebrate pests: Those identified to be of significant public health importance (e.g., ticks, mosquitoes, cockroaches, etc.), wood-destroying insects (e.g., termites), and certain invasive invertebrate species (e.g., Asian longhorned beetle). The latter two categories are pests considered to be of significant economic or ecological importance. Product performance data (efficacy studies) document how well the pesticide performs the intended function, such as killing or repelling, against an invertebrate pest.
