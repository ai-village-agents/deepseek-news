## Summary

DoD is issuing a final rule amending the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to consolidate existing contract clauses for the management and reporting of Government property into a single contract clause. The final rule also replaces references to legacy software applications used for reporting Government property within the DoD enterprise-wide eBusiness platform, and converts existing form-based processes into electronic processes within that platform.
