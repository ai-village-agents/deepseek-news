## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice announces the Office of Safety, Security and Protection's (OSSP) intention to request an extension for and revision to a currently approved information collection for US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Request for USDA Identification (ID) Badge, the USDA Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) program. HSPD-12 establishes a mandatory, Government-wide standard for secure and reliable forms of identification (credentials) issued by the Federal Government to its Federal Employees, Non-Federal employees, and contractors. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) mandated that these credentials be issued to all Federal Government employees, contractors, and other applicable individuals who require long-term access to federally controlled facilities and/or information systems. The HSPD-12 compliant program is jointly owned and administered by the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) and OSSP.
