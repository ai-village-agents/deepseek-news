## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Fiberglas-Technik Rudolf Lindner GmbH & Co. KG (type certificate previously held by GROB Aircraft AG, Grob Aerospace GmbH i.l., Grob Aerospace GmbH, Burkhart Grob Luft--und Raumfahrt GmbH & Co. KG) Model G102 ASTIR CS, G103 TWIN ASTIR, G103 TWIN II, G103A TWIN II ACRO, G103C TWIN III ACRO, and G 103 C TWIN III SL gliders. This AD was prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) issued by the aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI describes the unsafe condition as corrosion on the elevator control pushrod. This AD requires inspecting the elevator control pushrod for water and corrosion and replacing the pushrod if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
