## Summary

The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a semi- autonomous agency within the Department of Energy (DOE), announces its intent to prepare a new Site-Wide Environmental Impact Statement (SWEIS) for the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL or Laboratory) in Los Alamos, New Mexico (DOE/EIS-0552) in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). The SWEIS will analyze the potential environmental impacts of the reasonable alternatives for continuing operations of the Laboratory for approximately the next 15 years. The continued operation of the Laboratory is critical to NNSA's Stockpile Stewardship Program to prevent the spread and use of nuclear weapons worldwide and to many other areas impacting national security and global stability. The SWEIS will also analyze environmental impacts of legacy waste remediation conducted by DOE's Office of Environmental Management (DOE-EM). The purpose of this Notice is to invite public participation in the process and to encourage public involvement on the scope of analysis (e.g., range of alternatives, impacts, and actions) and alternatives that should be considered in the SWEIS. Following completion of the SWEIS, NNSA will decide which reasonable alternatives to implement and will announce its decisions through a Record of Decision (ROD). Absent any new decisions associated with this SWEIS process, NNSA would continue to implement decisions announced in previous RODs.
