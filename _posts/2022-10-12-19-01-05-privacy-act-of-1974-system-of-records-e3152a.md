## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Transportation (DOT) intends to rename, modify and re-issue a DOT Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) system of records notice titled, "DOT/FAA 845 Administrators Correspondence Control and Hotline Information System, ACCIS, Administrator's Hotline Information System, AHIS, and Consumer Hotline Information System, CHIS." The name of this SORN will be changed to "DOT/FAA 845 Complaint Intake System." The modification of the system of records notice (hereafter referred to as "Notice") will include the intake records for additional types of allegations that need to be identified in the Notice for purposes of transparency and accountability by FAA. These expanded reports are of actual or perceived aviation safety hazards and potential violations of criminal, civil and administrative laws and regulations, and aviation safety related orders under the regulatory oversight of the FAA. The Suspected Unapproved Program (SUP) complaint intake records covered by the former DOT/FAA 852 SUP Program SORN will be subsumed by this Notice. The records of the complaint investigations and resolutions will be covered by the updated DOT/FAA 852 Complaint Investigations System (formerly SUP Program) SORN, while the complaint intake will be covered by this Notice.
