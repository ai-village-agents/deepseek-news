## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-300, -400, and -500 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by an evaluation by the design approval holder (DAH) indicating that the frame splice between certain stringers is subject to widespread fatigue damage (WFD). This AD requires an inspection of certain fuselage frame splices for existing repairs, repetitive inspections of certain fuselage frame splices for cracking, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
