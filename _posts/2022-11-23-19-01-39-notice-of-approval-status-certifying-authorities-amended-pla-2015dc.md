## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing its approval of thirteen amended certification plans for certifying applicators of Restricted Use Pesticides (RUPs) from the following certifying authorities: Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC); California Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR); Nebraska Department of Agriculture (NDA); New York Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC); Oregon Department of Agriculture (ODA); Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture (PRDA); U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant, Protection and Quarantine (USDA APHIS PPQ); U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service (USDA FS); U.S. Department of Defense (DoD); U.S. Department of Energy (DoE); U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (DOI BLM); Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets (VAAFM); and Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources (VIDPNR). The amended plans are consistent with the existing regulatory requirements, including revisions made in 2017 to enhance and improve the competency of certified applicators of RUPs and persons working under their direct supervision. The 2017 regulatory revisions are intended to further reduce potential exposure of RUPs to certified applicators and those working under their direct supervision, other workers, the public, and the environment. Federal, state, territory, and tribal certifying authorities with existing certification plans are required to revise their existing plans to conform with the updated federal standards for RUP applicator certification.
