## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Pilatus Aircraft Ltd. (Pilatus) Model PC-24 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that electronic circuit breakers (ECBs) were found in a locked state after maintenance, but before flight. This AD requires revising the airplane flight manual (AFM) to incorporate a procedure to check for the ECB status. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
