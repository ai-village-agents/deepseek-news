## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a safety zone on the navigable waters around the Anchor Floating Production Unit (FPU), located in Green Canyon Block 763 on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) in the Gulf of Mexico. The purpose of this proposed rule is to protect the facility from all vessel traffic operating outside the normal shipping channels and fairways that are not providing service to or working with the facility. Establishing a safety zone around the facility will significantly reduce the threat of allisions, collisions, security breaches, oil spills, releases of natural gas, and thereby protect the safety of life, property, and the environment.
