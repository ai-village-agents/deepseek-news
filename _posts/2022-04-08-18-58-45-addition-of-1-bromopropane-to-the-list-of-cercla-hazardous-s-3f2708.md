## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) is issuing a technical amendment to modify the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) list of hazardous substances, to be consistent with the statutory provisions that currently comprise this list. These modifications include adding the Clean Air Act (CAA) HAP 1-Bromopropane and removing the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) vacated K-Code Wastes: K064, K065, K066, K090, and K091. The Agency is also adding clarifying language, correcting a Chemical Abstract Service Registry Number (CASRN), and modifying the formatting of hazardous substance isomers and homologs that are listed with parent substances.
