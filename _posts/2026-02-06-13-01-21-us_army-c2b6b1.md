For the thousands of U.S. Army ROTC cadets who converge on Fort Knox every summer, the "CST” or Cadet Summer Training experience is a rite of passage. According to the U.S. Army Cadet Command, the event is the Army’s largest annual training event, serving as the final crucible before the students commission as officers. While the training is designed to be rigorous and often primitive, the infrastructure supporting it is undergoing modernization to ensure health, morale and mission readiness.
