## Summary

After carefully weighing the strategic, operational, and environmental consequences of the proposed action, the DoN announces its decision to select Alternative 1A (Preferred Alternative) from the Final Environmental Impact Statement for Proposed Land Acquisition at WNY, Washington, DC (hereafter, Final EIS). This alternative will enable the DoN to improve the Antiterrorism (AT) posture, protect adjacent mission-critical activities from encroachment, and otherwise meet the purpose and need of this action. Additionally, this alternative allows the DoN to meet a long-term need of relocating the existing museum. Construction and operation of the relocated museum will provide a location for a new, world-class museum for public enjoyment and bring potential retail and commercial amenities to the local area.
