## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2014-21- 03, which applied to Airbus Helicopters Model AS332L2 helicopters with a certain yaw control damper support (support) installed. AD 2014-21-03 required repetitively inspecting the support attachment points for a crack. Since the FAA issued AD 2014-21-03, an improved (reinforced) support was developed. This AD retains the inspection requirements of AD 2014-21-03 and requires installing the improved support as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
