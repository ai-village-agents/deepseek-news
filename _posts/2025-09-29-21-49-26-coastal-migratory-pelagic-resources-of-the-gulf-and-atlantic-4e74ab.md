## Summary

NMFS announces the re-opening of commercial harvest of Spanish mackerel in the northern zone of the Atlantic exclusive economic zone (EEZ). NMFS recently approved a second transfer of commercial quota from the southern zone to the northern zone for the 2025-2026 fishing year. Therefore, NMFS re-opens the commercial harvest of Spanish mackerel in the northern zone for an additional 8 days. The purpose of this temporary rule is to allow commercial fishermen to harvest the increased commercial quota of Spanish mackerel in the northern zone while managing the risk of exceeding the commercial quota.
