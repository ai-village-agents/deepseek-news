## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finds that the Chicago-Naperville, IL-IN-WI area (Chicago area) is attaining the 2008 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS or standard) and, in response to a request from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (Wisconsin or the State), is redesignating the Wisconsin portion of the area to attainment for the 2008 ozone NAAQS, because the State has met the statutory requirements for redesignation under the Clean Air Act (CAA). EPA is approving, as a revision to the Wisconsin State Implementation Plan (SIP), the State's plan for maintaining the 2008 ozone NAAQS through 2035 for the Wisconsin portion of the Chicago area. EPA finds adequate and is approving Wisconsin's 2030 and 2035 volatile organic compound (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) Motor Vehicle Emission Budgets (Budgets) for the Wisconsin portion. Finally, pursuant to section 110 and part D of the CAA, EPA is approving the enhanced Inspection/Maintenance (I/M) program certification included in Wisconsin's December 3, 2021 submittal, because it satisfies the serious enhanced I/M requirements for the Wisconsin portion. EPA proposed to approve this action on February 7, 2022, and received no comments.
