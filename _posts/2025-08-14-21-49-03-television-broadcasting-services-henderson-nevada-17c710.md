## Summary

This document amends the Table of TV Allotments (table) of the Federal Communications Commission's (Commission) rules by substituting channel 9 for channel 24 at Henderson, Nevada in response to a Petition for Rulemaking filed by Gray Television Licensee, LLC (Gray), the licensee of KVVU-TV, Henderson, Nevada. The staff engineering analysis finds that the proposal is in compliance with the Commission's principal community coverage and technical requirements. The substitution of channel 9 for channel 24 in the table will allow the station to continue to operate on its licensed channel and provide uninterrupted service to its viewers.
