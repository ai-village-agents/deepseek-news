## Summary

Secretarial Order 3376 addresses regulatory uncertainty on how agencies within the Department of the Interior manage recreational opportunities for electric bikes (E-bikes) on trails and paths where traditional bikes are allowed. To provide consistency in Federal policy among agencies with recreational opportunities pertinent to Secretarial Order 3376, the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is proposing to amend this regulation to add a definition for E-bikes and exempt E- bikes from the regulatory definition of an off-road vehicle where E- bikes are being used on roads and trails where mechanized, non- motorized use is allowed, they are not being propelled exclusively by a motorized source, and the appropriate regional director expressly determines through a formal decision that E-bikes should be treated the same as non-motorized bicycles. This proposed change would facilitate increased E-bike use where other types of bicycles are allowed in a manner consistent with existing use of Reclamation land, and increase recreational opportunities for all Americans, especially those with physical limitations.
