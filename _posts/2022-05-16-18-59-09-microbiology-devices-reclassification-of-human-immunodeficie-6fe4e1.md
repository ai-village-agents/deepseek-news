## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, we, or the Agency) is issuing a final order to reclassify certain human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serological diagnostic and supplemental tests and HIV nucleic acid (NAT) diagnostic and supplemental tests, postamendments class III devices with the product code MZF, into class II (special controls), subject to premarket notification. Through this final order, FDA is also adding two new device classification regulations and identifying special controls that the Agency believes are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for these device types. This final order will reduce the regulatory burdens associated with these device types, as manufacturers will no longer be required to submit a premarket approval application (PMA) but can instead submit a premarket notification (510(k)) and receive clearance before marketing their device.
