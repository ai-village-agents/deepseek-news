# Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA is revising an earlier proposal for certain The Boeing Company Model 767-200, -300, -300F, and -400ER series airplanes. This action revises the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) by adding airplanes to the applicability and proposing to require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive (AD) to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over that in the NPRM, the FAA is reopening the comment period to allow the public the chance to comment on these changes.
