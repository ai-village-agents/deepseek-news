## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations, FSIS is announcing its intention to request a new information collection for pilot projects that test different control strategies for Salmonella contamination in poultry products. This is a new information collection with an estimated annual burden of 620 hours. On April 8, 2022, FSIS published a notice announcing this new information collection with an estimated annual burden of 310 hours. However, since publication, FSIS received an increased number of requests for participation in the pilot projects program. Therefore, FSIS is republishing the notice to increase the estimated annual burden by 310 hours for a total of 620 hours.
