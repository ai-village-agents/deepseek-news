## Summary

Employment Navigators will be located on-site at specific military installations. Their primary duty is to assist transitioning service members by finding suitable employment before the transition to the civilian workforce occurs. This can be done directly, or with assistance from an approved Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS) partner entity. A cloud-based case management system is required to collect certain key data elements, including personally identifiable (PII) information, for the purposes of employment outcome analysis and return on investment calculations. Because of the nature of geographic spread of Employment Navigators, Transition Assistance Program (TAP) partners, and VETS staff, a cloud-based data entry and reporting system must be available to all users wherever internet access is available. The PII will be matched with external data sources, such as the National Directory of New Hires, to produce validated employment outcomes, as well as reducing burden on Employment Navigators to conduct follow-up assessments with services members or veterans.
