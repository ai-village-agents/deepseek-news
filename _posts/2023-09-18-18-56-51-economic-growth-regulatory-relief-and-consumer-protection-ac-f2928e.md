## Summary

This notice extends the compliance date for HUD's National Standards for the Physical Inspection of Real Estate (NSPIRE) final rule for Community Planning and Development (CPD) programs. Specifically, HUD is extending the compliance date for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) and Housing Trust Fund (HTF), Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS (HOPWA), Emergency Solution Grants (ESG) and Continuum of Care (COC) programs ("CPD programs") until October 1, 2024. HUD is taking this action to allow jurisdictions, participants, and grantees additional time to incorporate HUD's NSPIRE standards specific to their own programs and the flexibility to transition to NSPIRE under their own timelines.
