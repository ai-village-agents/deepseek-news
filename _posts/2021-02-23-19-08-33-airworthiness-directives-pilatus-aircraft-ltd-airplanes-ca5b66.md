## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Pilatus Aircraft Ltd. (Pilatus) Model PC-12/47E airplanes. This AD was prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI describes the unsafe condition as inboard flap fairings aft (IFFAs) having an incorrect shape, which may result in chafing between the IFFA and the associated front inboard tension rod. This AD requires an inspection of the IFFAs for the correct shape and chafing between the IFFA and the associated front inboard tension rod, with corrective action as necessary. This condition could lead to failure of the inboard flap drive arm with consequent asymmetric flap extension, resulting in reduced control of the airplane. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
