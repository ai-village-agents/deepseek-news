## Summary

In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, we, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, are preparing an environmental assessment for a wintertime access to inholdings right-of-way (ROW) application that we have received from Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation. The application is for an ROW across the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Due to the complexity of the project, we are announcing our need to extend the timeframe for completing the EA.
