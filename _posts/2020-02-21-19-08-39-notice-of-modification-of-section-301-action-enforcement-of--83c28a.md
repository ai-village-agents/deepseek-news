## Summary

Effective October 18, 2019, the U.S. Trade Representative imposed additional duties on certain products of the EU and certain EU member States in this Section 301 investigation to enforce U.S. WTO rights in the Large Civil Aircraft dispute. On December 12, 2019, the U.S. Trade Representative announced a review of the Section 301 action and requested public comments. Based on this review, the U.S. Trade Representative has determined to revise the action being taken by increasing the rate of additional duties on certain large civil aircraft, and by modifying the list of other products of certain current and former EU member States subject to additional 25 percent duties.
