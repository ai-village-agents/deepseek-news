NMFS, Southeast Region, in collaboration with the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council) intends to prepare a DEIS to describe and analyze management alternatives to be included in Amendment 53 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico (Amendment 53). Amendment 53 will address the conservation and management of Gulf of Mexico red grouper and will consider alternatives to revise the commercial and recreational sector allocation, the overfishing limit (OFL), acceptable biological catch (ABC), annual catch limits (ACLs), and annual catch targets (ACTs). The purpose of this NOI is to solicit public comments on the scope of issues to be addressed in the DEIS.
