## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing approval of revisions to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted on November 29, 2021, by the State of Missouri. Missouri requests EPA approve revisions to a state regulation related to the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule SO<INF>2</INF> Group 1 Trading Program. These revisions include reallocating SO<INF>2</INF> emission allowances from a recently retired emission unit to the original emission unit for which they were designated. Additionally, the revisions clarify rule language by condensing a list of provisions excluded from incorporation by reference. Approval of these revisions will not impact air quality and ensures Federal enforceability of the State's rules. The EPA is proposing to approve these SIP revisions in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
