## Summary

The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), in coordination with the Maritime Administration (MARAD), will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) as part of the environmental review of the ST LNG, LLC (ST LNG or Applicant) deepwater port license application. The application proposes the ownership, construction, operation, and eventual decommissioning of an offshore natural gas export deepwater port, known as the ST LNG Deepwater Port Development Project, which would be in Federal waters approximately 10.4 nautical miles (19.2 kilometers) offshore Matagorda, Texas in water depths of approximately 65 to 75 feet (20 to 22 meters). The deepwater port would allow for the loading of liquefied natural gas (LNG) trading carriers. This Notice of Intent (NOI) requests public participation in the scoping process, provides information on how to participate, and announces an informational open house and public meeting. Pursuant to the criteria provided in the Deepwater Port Act of 1974 (DWPA), as amended, Texas is the designated Adjacent Coastal State (ACS) for this application.
