## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing a limited approval and limited disapproval of revisions to the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District (SJVAPCD or "District") portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern volatile organic compounds (VOC), oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>), particulate matter (PM) (including PM equal to or less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) and PM equal to or less than 10 microns in diameter (PM<INF>10</INF>)), and their precursors. This action addresses a revised rule governing the issuance of permits for stationary sources, focusing on the preconstruction review and permitting of major sources and major modifications under part D of title I of the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act"). We are taking comments on this proposal and a final action will follow.
