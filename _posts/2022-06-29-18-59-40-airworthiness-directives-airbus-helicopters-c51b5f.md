# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model AS332C, AS332C1, AS332L, and AS332L1 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by review of maintenance instructions that showed conflicting methods of recording torque cycles for certain parts. This proposed AD would require recalculating the torque cycles of certain parts, updating log cards, and replacing those parts before exceeding their recalculated service life limits (life limits); removing certain other parts from service; and applying an operational restriction on certain parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
