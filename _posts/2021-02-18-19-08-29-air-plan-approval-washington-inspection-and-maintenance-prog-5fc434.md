## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a revision to the Washington State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Washington on June 2, 2019, through the Washington Department of Ecology. The revision, applicable in Clark, King, Pierce, Snohomish, and Spokane Counties, Washington, removes the Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) program from the active control measure portion of the SIP. The I/M program was previously approved into the SIP for use as a component of the State's plans to address on-road sources in certain former nonattainment areas and is now part of the contingency portion of the applicable SIP for each area. The EPA has determined that Washington's June 2, 2019 SIP revision is consistent with the applicable portions of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
