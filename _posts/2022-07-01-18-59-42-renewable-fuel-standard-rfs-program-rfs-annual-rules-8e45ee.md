## Summary

Under section 211 of the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is required to set standards every year to implement nationally applicable renewable fuel volume targets. This action modifies the 2021 and 2022 statutory volume targets for cellulosic biofuel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel, as well as establishes the 2022 volume target for biomass-based diesel. This action also modifies the previously established cellulosic biofuel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel volume requirements for 2020. In addition, this action establishes the 2020, 2021, and 2022 renewable fuel percentage standards for all four of the above biofuel categories. Finally, this action also addresses a judicial remand of the 2016 standard-setting rulemaking, as well as several regulatory changes to the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program, including regulations for the use of biointermediates to produce qualifying renewable fuel, flexibilities for regulated parties, and clarifications of existing regulations.
