## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-03- 19, which applied to certain Dassault Aviation Model MYSTERE-FALCON 20- C5, 20-D5, 20-E5, and 20-F5 airplanes. AD 2020-03-19 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2020-03-19 and requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate additional new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations; as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
