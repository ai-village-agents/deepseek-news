## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission or Agency) has modified an existing system of records, FCC/OMD-17, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Privacy Act Requests, subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. This action is necessary to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act to publish in the Federal Register notice of the existence and character of records maintained by the agency. The FCC's Office of the Managing Director (OMD) will use the FCC FOIA Case Management Solution, an online portal, to accept, manage, and track Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and appeals, and manage and track Privacy Act requests and appeals through their lifecycles. The FCC FOIA Case Management Solution permits members of the public to file and appeal FOIA requests and to search various fields of data (as designated by the FCC) concerning requests, appeals, and responsive records. The FCC FOIA Case Management Solution is not usable by members of the public to file and appeal Privacy Act requests, but the FCC uses it to manage and track such requests and appeals that the agency receives through other channels. The FCC began transitioning from FOIAonline, its prior FOIA and Privacy Act case management system, to the FCC FOIA Case Management Solution in October 2023.
