## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is promulgating a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for attaining the 2010 sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) primary national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for the Detroit SO<INF>2</INF> nonattainment area. The FIP includes an attainment demonstration and other elements required under the Clean Air Act (CAA). In addition to an attainment demonstration, the FIP addresses the requirement for meeting reasonable further progress (RFP) toward attainment of the NAAQS, reasonably available control measures and reasonably available control technology (RACM/RACT), enforceable emission limitations and control measures to provide for NAAQS attainment, and contingency measures. This action supplements a prior action which found that Michigan had satisfied emission inventory and nonattainment new source review (NSR) requirements for this area but had not met requirements for the elements addressed in the FIP. The FIP provides for attainment of the 2010 primary SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS in the Detroit SO<INF>2</INF> nonattainment area and meets the other applicable requirements under the CAA.
