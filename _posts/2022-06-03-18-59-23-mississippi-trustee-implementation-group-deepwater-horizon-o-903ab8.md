## Summary

In accordance with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the Final Programmatic Damage Assessment Restoration Plan and Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (Final PDARP/PEIS) and Record of Decision, and the Consent Decree, the Federal and State natural resource trustee agencies for the Mississippi Trustee Implementation Group (MS TIG) have prepared the Mississippi Trustee Implementation Group Final Restoration Plan 3 and Environmental Assessment: Habitat Projects on Federally Managed Lands, Sea Turtles, Marine Mammals, Birds, and Provide and Enhance Recreational Opportunities (Final RP3/EA); and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI). The Final RP3/EA describes and, in conjunction with the associated FONSI, selects for funding and implementation the preferred restoration projects considered by the MS TIG to compensate for natural resources and their services in the Mississippi Restoration Area as a result of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The approximate cost to implement the MS TIG's preferred projects is $19,000,000. The purpose of this notice is to inform the public of the availability of the Final RP3/EA and FONSI.
