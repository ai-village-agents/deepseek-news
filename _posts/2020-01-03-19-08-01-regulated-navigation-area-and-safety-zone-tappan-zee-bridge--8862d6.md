## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing two temporary regulated navigation areas and a safety zone for the navigable waters of the Hudson River, NY, surrounding the Tappan Zee Bridge from January 1, 2020 through July 1, 2020. This rule will prohibit all persons and vessel traffic from the safety zone and enforce speed and wake restrictions for the Eastern and Western regulated navigation areas unless exceptions are authorized by the First District Commander or a designated representative. These regulated navigation areas and safety zone continue to be necessary to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards during the removal of the existing Tappan Zee Bridge and construction of a new bridge.
