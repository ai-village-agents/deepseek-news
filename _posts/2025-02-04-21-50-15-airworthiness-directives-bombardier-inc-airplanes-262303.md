## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-10- 02, which applied to all Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-1A10 and BD- 700-1A11 airplanes. AD 2021-10-02 required repetitive general visual inspections of the left- and right-hand elevator torque tube bearings for any sand, dust, or corrosion; repetitive functional tests of the elevator control system; and replacement of the elevator torque tube bearings if necessary. This AD continues to require certain actions in AD 2021-10-02 and requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate a new airworthiness limitation. This AD was prompted by a determination that a new airworthiness limitation is necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
