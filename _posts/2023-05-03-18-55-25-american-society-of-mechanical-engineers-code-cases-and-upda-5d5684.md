## Summary

On March 6, 2023, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) solicited comments on proposed amendments to its regulations to incorporate by reference proposed revisions to three regulatory guides, which would approve new, revised, and reaffirmed code cases published by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. In addition, the rulemaking proposed to extend the time periods required for licensees to update their codes of record. The public comment period was originally scheduled to close on May 5, 2023. The NRC has decided to extend the public comment period by an additional 42 days to June 16, 2023, to allow more time for members of the public to develop and submit their comments.
