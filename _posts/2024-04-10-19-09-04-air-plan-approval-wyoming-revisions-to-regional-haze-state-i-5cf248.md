## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Wyoming on December 30, 2022, and supplemented on August 31, 2023, and November 16, 2023, addressing regional haze (Wyoming 2022 SIP revision). The Wyoming 2022 SIP revision replaces Wyoming's previously approved source-specific nitrogen oxide (NO<INF>X</INF>) determination for PacifiCorp's Jim Bridger power plant (Jim Bridger) Units 1 and 2 of 0.07 lb/MMBtu for each unit associated with the installation of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) controls to address the long-term strategy. Specifically, the Wyoming 2022 SIP revision finds that conversion from coal-firing to natural gas-firing, together with NO<INF>X</INF> emission and heat input limits of 0.12 lb/MMBtu (30-day rolling average), 1,314 tons/year, and 21,900,000 MMBtu/year, respectively, allows for identical reasonable progress during the first planning period as the installation SCR controls. Separately, we are also proposing to approve Wyoming's monthly and annual NO<INF>X</INF> and sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) emissions limits for Jim Bridger Units 1-4. The EPA is proposing this action pursuant to sections 110 and 169A of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
