## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Dassault Aviation Model FALCON 7X airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of an incorrect version of EASy "Top-Level System" operational software installed in the avionics system due to use of an improper CD-ROM. This AD requires ensuring that the correct versions of the operational software and CD-ROM are installed, and doing corrective action if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
