## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2004-06- 01, which applied to certain Dornier Model 328-100 series airplanes; and AD 2009-06-09, which applied to all Dornier Model 328-100 series airplanes. AD 2004-06-01 required replacement of the existing main landing gear (MLG) leg assembly with a modified assembly. AD 2009-06-09 required modifying the MLG main body and trailing arm bushings, and revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. This AD continues to require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations; as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
