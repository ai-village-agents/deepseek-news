## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) amends its rules to update the template for the recently adopted broadband consumer label. The revised label template reflects a new Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) application landing page. This action does not modify or otherwise change any entity's underlying responsibilities under the Broadband Label Order. It simply ensures that broadband internet access service providers know as early as possible what content must be displayed in the labels.
