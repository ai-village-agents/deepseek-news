# Single Network Future: Supplemental Coverage From Space; Space Innovation

## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) seeks comment on ways in which it can improve 911 service for supplemental coverage from space (SCS) connections. Specifically, the Commission seeks comment on how it can propel the industry toward a truly ubiquitous automatic location-based routing of all 911 calls to accelerate connections between first responders and those who need help, regardless of their location. Next, in recognition of the importance of safeguarding radio astronomy, the Commission seeks further comment on ways to improve the coordination process between Federal and non-Federal stakeholders in the SCS context and on whether additional rule changes or policies are necessary to avoid harmful interference to radio astronomy and related services beyond the SCS licensing process the Commission adopts today.
