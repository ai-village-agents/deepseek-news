## Summary

In accordance with its rule regarding recordkeeping for timely deposit insurance determination, the FDIC is providing notice that it has granted time-limited exception relief to covered institutions until March 31, 2022, from information technology system requirements and recordkeeping requirements for principal and interest payments held in mortgage servicing accounts for which the covered institutions act as servicers or sub-servicers. The recommended relief will provide the covered institutions additional time to remediate their servicing platforms and internal processing capabilities pending further direction from the FDIC.
