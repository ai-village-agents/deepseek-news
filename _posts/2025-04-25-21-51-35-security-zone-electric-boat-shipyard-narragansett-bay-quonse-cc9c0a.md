## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a security zone in the waters adjacent to the General Dynamics Electric Boat Corporation Quonset Point facility in Narragansett Bay, North Kingstown, RI. This action is necessary to protect the facility, material storage areas, and adjacent areas from sabotage or other subversive acts, accidents or incidents of a similar nature. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit all persons and vessels from operating within the prescribed security zone without first obtaining authorization by the Captain of the Port, Sector Southeastern New England or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
