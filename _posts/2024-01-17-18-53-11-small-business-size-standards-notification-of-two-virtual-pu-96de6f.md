## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is holding a series of two virtual public forums on size standards to update the public on the status of the forthcoming third five-year review of size standards, as mandated by the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, and to consider public testimony on proposed changes to the SBA's size standards methodology for establishing, reviewing, or modifying size standards, as detailed in SBA's 2023 Revised Size Standards Methodology White Paper (2023 Revised Methodology). Testimony presented at these forums will become part of the administrative record for SBA's consideration when finalizing the 2023 Revised Methodology.
