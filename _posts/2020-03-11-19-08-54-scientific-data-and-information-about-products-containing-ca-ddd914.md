## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, Agency, or we) is reopening the comment period for the notice that appeared in the Federal Register of April 3, 2019, and extending it indefinitely. The notice announced a public hearing to obtain scientific data and information about the safety, manufacturing, product quality, marketing, labeling, and sale of products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds. In addition, it notified the public that FDA was establishing a docket for public comment on this hearing and that the docket would close on July 2, 2019. On June 20, 2019, a notice that appeared in the Federal Register extended the comment period to July 16, 2019. To provide a public and transparent way for stakeholders to provide new and emerging information to us in real time as it becomes available, we are reopening the comment period and extending it indefinitely to allow interested parties to continue to comment. We are particularly interested in data that may help to address uncertainties and data gaps related to the safety of cannabidiol (CBD).
