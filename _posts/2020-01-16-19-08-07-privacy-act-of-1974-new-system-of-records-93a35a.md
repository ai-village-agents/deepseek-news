## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) proposes to add a system of records to its inventory of records systems. The system of records will cover information collected under the U.S. Domestic Hemp Production Program in AMS. This notice is necessary to meet the Privacy Act requirement that a Federal Register notice describing the existence and character of record systems to be maintained by the agency be published.
