## Summary

These special conditions are issued for the Dassault Aviation (Dassault) Model Falcon 6X airplane. This airplane will have novel or unusual design features associated with flight-envelope protections, in icing and non-icing conditions, that use high-incidence protection to automatically advance throttles when the airplane angle of attack (AoA) reaches a predetermined value. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
