## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Dassault Aviation Model Falcon 7X airplanes. This AD was prompted by hydraulic leakage from the spoiler power control unit (SPPCU) in service. Relevant investigations determined that, following certain failures, the spoiler electrical control unit (SPECU) can deliver an untimely and permanent activation command to the SPPCU standby electrical pump, which can possibly result in overheating and significant hydraulic leakage of the unit. This AD requires replacing the affected SPECUs and prohibits the installation of affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
