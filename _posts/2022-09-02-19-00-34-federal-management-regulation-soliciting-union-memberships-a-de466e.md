## Summary

GSA is issuing a final rule amending the Federal Management Regulation (FMR) to revise the soliciting, vending, and debt collection policy. The rule will update policies consistent with the White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment recommendations to revise the FMR. This rule will clarify that activities related to worker organizing and collective bargaining among contractors' employees working in Federal Government facilities are not covered or restricted by the general prohibition on soliciting, posting and distributing materials in or on Federal property under the jurisdiction, custody or control of GSA (GSA-controlled property).
