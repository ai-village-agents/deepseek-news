## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing amendments to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for the Carbon Black Production major source category. The proposal addresses the results of the residual risk and technology review (RTR) for this source category as required under the Clean Air Act (CAA). The proposed amendments address hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions that occur after the main unit filter of a carbon black production unit, as well as emissions from boilers and process heaters. The proposed amendments also address the startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) provisions of the existing standards, and would require electronic reporting of certain notifications, performance test results, and semiannual reports. Additionally, the proposal addresses the results of the technology review for the Carbon Black Production Area Source NESHAP.
