## Summary

This action amends Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface for Atlanta Speedway Airport (formerly Clayton County-Tara Field), Hampton, GA by updating the airport's name and geographical coordinates to coincide with the FAA's database. This action also increases the radius and removes excessive verbiage from the legal description of the airport. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.
