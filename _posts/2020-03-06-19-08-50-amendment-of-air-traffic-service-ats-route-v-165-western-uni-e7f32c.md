## Summary

This action amends one domestic Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airway V-165 in the western United States. The modifications are necessary due to the planned decommissioning of Clovis, CA, VOR portion of the VOR/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) navigation aid (NAVAID), which provides navigation guidance for portions of the affected ATS route. The Clovis, CA, VOR is being decommissioned as part of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
