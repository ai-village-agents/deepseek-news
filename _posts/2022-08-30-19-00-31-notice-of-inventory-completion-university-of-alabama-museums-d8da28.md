The University of Alabama Museums has completed an inventory of human remains and associated funerary objects from the Moundville archeological site (1Tu500) in Hale County, AL, as well as adjacent archeological sites in Hale and Tuscaloosa Counties, AL. In consultation with the appropriate Indian Tribes, the University of Alabama Museums has determined, pursuant to NAGPRA, that there is a cultural affiliation between these human remains and associated funerary objects and the present-day Muskogean-speaking Indian Tribes. Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request to the University of Alabama Museums. If no additional requestors come forward, transfer of control of the human remains and associated funerary objects to the Indian Tribes listed in this notice may proceed.
