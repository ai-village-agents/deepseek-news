## Summary

This document announces the extension of the review periods for significant new use notices (SNUNs) identified as SN-23-0002 through 0006 and SN-23-0008 through 0011 submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). EPA has determined that an extension of the statutory 90-day review periods for these SNUNs is necessary to allow the Agency to complete the required analysis under TSCA, investigate potential risk, examine regulatory options, and prepare the necessary documents should the Agency determine that further regulatory action is required.
