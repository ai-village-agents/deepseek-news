## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC, Commission, or Agency) proposes to modify an existing system of records, FCC/CGB-2, Comment Filing System (ECFS), subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. This action is necessary to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act to publish in the Federal Register notice of the existence and character of records maintained by the agency. The Commission uses this system to handle and process public comments related to FCC rulemakings and other proceedings. This modification changes the name of the former FCC/CGB-2 SORN to FCC/OS-1 and makes various necessary changes and updates, including clarification of the purpose of the system, formatting changes required by OMB Circular A-108 since its previous publication, and the addition of new routine uses.
