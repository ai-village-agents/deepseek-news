## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved revisions to Arizona's federally authorized hazardous waste program by publishing proposed and direct final rules in the Federal Register on September 28, 2021. EPA inadvertently omitted a citation to Checklist 233 in the text of the proposed and direct final rule. With this correction, EPA is clarifying that Arizona has adopted Checklist 233 and is authorized for the Response to Vacatur of Certain Provisions of the Definition of Solid Waste Rule published on May 30, 2018. Additionally, EPA is clarifying that Arizona is not required to adopt Checklist 224: Withdrawal of the Emission Comparable Fuel Exclusion. Arizona did not adopt the exclusion contained in Checklist 221, and thus, does not have the exclusion as part of its authorized state program. We are proposing to correct these and related errors. EPA seeks public comment prior to taking final action.
