## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-18- 12, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A330-841 and -941 airplanes. AD 2022-18-12 required installing serviceable engine electronic control (EEC) software or EEC units having the serviceable software, limiting certain parts installation configurations, and prior or concurrent modification of EEC software. This AD was prompted by a determination that engine crystal icing protection could be (temporarily) lost if an erroneous total pressure value is provided by the airplane system, which is addressed through EEC software. This AD continues to require certain actions in AD 2022-18-12 and requires adding new limitations for intermixing of certain EEC software standards and a new operational limitation for engines with certain EEC software installed, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also prohibits the installation of certain engines under certain conditions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
