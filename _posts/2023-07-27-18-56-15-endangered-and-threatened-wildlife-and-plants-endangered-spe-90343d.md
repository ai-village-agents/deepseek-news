## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to list two species and one subspecies of Brazilian swallowtail butterflies as endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Specifically, we are proposing to list the Fluminense swallowtail (Parides ascanius), Harris' mimic swallowtail (Eurytides (=Mimoides) lysithous harrisianus), and Hahnel's Amazonian swallowtail (Parides hahneli), all butterflies endemic to Brazil. After a review of the best scientific and commercial information available, we find that listing all three swallowtails is warranted. Accordingly, we propose to list the Fluminense swallowtail, Harris' mimic swallowtail, and Hahnel's Amazonian swallowtail as endangered species under the Act. If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would add these species to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and extend the Act's protections to these species.
