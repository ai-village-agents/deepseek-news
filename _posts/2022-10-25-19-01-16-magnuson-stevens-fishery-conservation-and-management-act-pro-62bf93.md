## Summary

NMFS announces that the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council submitted Amendment 23 to the Mackerel, Squid, and Butterfish Fishery Management Plan to the Secretary of Commerce for review and approval. We are requesting comments from the public on this amendment in accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. This amendment would implement a revised Atlantic mackerel rebuilding plan and the 2023 Atlantic mackerel specifications, including a 20-fish per person recreational possession limit. The purpose of this action is to rebuild the mackerel stock with appropriate measures so that optimum yield can be achieved on an ongoing basis.
