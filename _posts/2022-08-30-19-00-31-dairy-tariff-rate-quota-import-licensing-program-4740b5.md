## Summary

This interim final rule amends the regulations that provide for the issuance of licenses to import certain dairy articles under tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) as set forth in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). The rule suspends for an additional year the historical license reduction provision which would otherwise apply beginning with the 2023 quota year. This change will allow license holders additional time to adjust to challenging market conditions impacting the dairy sector.
