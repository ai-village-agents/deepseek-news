## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to list the short-tailed snake (Lampropeltis extenuata), a snake species from peninsular Florida, as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). This determination also serves as our 12-month finding on a petition to list the short-tailed snake. After a review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that listing the species is warranted. Accordingly, we propose to list the short-tailed snake as a threatened species with a rule issued under section 4(d) of the Act ("4(d) rule"). If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would add this species to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and extend the Act's protections to the species.
