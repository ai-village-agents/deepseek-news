## Summary

DoD, GSA, and NASA are issuing a final rule amending the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to add the framework for a new FAR part on information security and supply chain security. The creation of this new FAR part does not implement any of the information security and supply chain security policies or procedures. The amendment simply establishes the new FAR part.
