## Summary

We are advising the public that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has prepared a final environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact relative to permitting the release of the insect Ganaspis brasiliensis for the biological control of spotted- wing Drosophila (Drosophila suzukii) in the contiguous United States. Based on our finding of no significant impact, we have determined that an environmental impact statement need not be prepared.
