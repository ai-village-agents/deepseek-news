## Summary

The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC or "Commission") commences a rulemaking to promulgate a trade regulation rule entitled "Rule on Impersonation of Government and Businesses," which would prohibit the impersonation of government, businesses, or their officials. The Commission finds such impersonation to be prevalent based on the comments it received in response to an advance notice of proposed rulemaking and other information discussed in this document. The Commission now solicits written comment, data, and arguments concerning the utility and scope of the proposed trade regulation rule to prohibit the impersonation of government, businesses, or their officials.
