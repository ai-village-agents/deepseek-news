## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for all navigable waters within a 600-foot radius of a fireworks display on the Columbia River for the City of Richland Christmas Fireworks display in Richland, WA. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters during a fireworks display on December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2022. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Columbia River or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
