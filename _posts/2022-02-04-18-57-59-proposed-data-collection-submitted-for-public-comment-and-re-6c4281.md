## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled the National School COVID-19 Prevention Study. This information collection request is designed to obtain data from a nationally representative sample of K-12 public schools in the United States to describe the prevalence of COVID-19 prevention strategies (e.g., mask use, physical distancing) that K-12 schools are implementing, including changes over time and differences by school-level characteristics and examine associations between school-level COVID-19 prevention strategies and COVID-19 transmission related outcomes in the school and larger community.
