## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for certain waters of the Potomac River. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters at the old Governor Harry W. Nice/Senator Thomas "Mac" Middleton Memorial (US- 301) Bridge, during demolition operations from November 8, 2023 through January 30, 2024. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port, Sector Maryland-National Capital Region or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
