## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 767-300 series airplanes modified by a certain supplemental type certificate (STC). This AD was prompted by a discovery that certain pitot-static tubing of the first officer's pitot-static system was installed incorrectly in the main and mid equipment center during the airplane conversion from passenger to freighter. This AD requires a visual inspection of certain pitot-static rigid tubes and flexible hoses to determine whether low points exist, and if necessary, related investigative and corrective actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
