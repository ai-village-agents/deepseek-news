The complaint, as supplemented, alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain pick-up truck folding bed cover systems and components thereof by reason of the infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 7,188,888 ("the '888 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 7,484,788 ("the '788 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 8,061,758 ("the '758 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 7,537,264 ("the '264 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 8,182,021 ("the '021 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 8,690,224 ("the '224 patent"); and U.S. Patent No. 9,815,358 ("the '358 patent").
