EPA is also proposing to approve a maintenance plan for the area demonstrating continued compliance with the 2006 PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS through 2031, which the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (IDEQ) submitted along with the redesignation request on September 13, 2019, for inclusion into the Idaho State Implementation Plan (SIP). Additionally, EPA is proposing to approve the 2031 motor vehicle emissions budgets included in Idaho's maintenance plan for PM<INF>2.5</INF>, nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) and volatile organic compounds (VOC). EPA is proposing this action pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act).
