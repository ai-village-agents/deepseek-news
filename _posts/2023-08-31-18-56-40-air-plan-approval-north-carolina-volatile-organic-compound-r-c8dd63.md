## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a final rule that appeared in the Federal Register on August 4, 2023, titled "Air Plan Approval; North Carolina; Volatile Organic Compound Regulations." The document approved revisions to the North Carolina State Implementation Plan concerning several updates to the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality's air regulations which apply to sources that emit volatile organic compounds. EPA approved those changes pursuant to the Clean Air Act. An error in the instructions amending the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in the document is identified and corrected in this action. This correction does not change any final action taken by EPA in the August 4, 2023, final rule.
