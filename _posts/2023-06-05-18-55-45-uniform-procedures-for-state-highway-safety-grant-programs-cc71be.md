## Summary

This final rule amends the uniform procedures implementing the State Highway Safety Grant Program to waive, for fiscal year 2024, the requirement that targets for the common performance measures be identical to targets in the State Highway Safety Improvement Plan. This final rule makes a corresponding change to a similar requirement in the Federal Highway Administration's performance management regulation.
