## Summary

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) invites organizations to provide products and technical expertise to support and demonstrate security platforms for two data confidentiality projects within the Data Confidentiality Building Block. The two projects are Data Confidentiality: Identifying and Protecting Assets and Data Against Data Breaches and Data Confidentiality: Detect, Respond to, and Recover from Data Breaches. This notice is the initial step for the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) in collaborating with technology companies to address cybersecurity challenges identified under the Data Confidentiality Building Block. Participation in the building block is open to all interested organizations and organizations may participate in one or both data Confidentiality projects.
