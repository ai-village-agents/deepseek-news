## Summary

NMFS implements an accountability measure (AM) for the recreational harvest of hogfish off Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina in the South Atlantic exclusive economic zone (EEZ). NMFS estimates that recreational landings of hogfish harvested off Georgia through North Carolina have exceeded the recreational annual catch limit (ACL). Therefore, NMFS closes the recreational sector for hogfish in the EEZ off Georgia through North Carolina to protect the hogfish resource.
