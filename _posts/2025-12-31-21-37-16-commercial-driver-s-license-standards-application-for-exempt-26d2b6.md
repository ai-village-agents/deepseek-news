## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to grant an exemption to the Massachusetts Department of State Police allowing the State to waive specific portions of the commercial driver's license (CDL) skills test for CDL applicants who take the skills test on the island of Martha's Vineyard and issue those drivers a restricted CDL. The Agency grants this exemption because the island of Martha's Vineyard does not have the highway infrastructure to support a demonstration of certain on- road safe driving skills required by the CDL skills test requirements. FMCSA concludes that granting the exemption, subject to the terms and conditions set forth below, is likely to achieve a level of safety equivalent to or greater than the level of safety that would be achieved absent the exemption.
