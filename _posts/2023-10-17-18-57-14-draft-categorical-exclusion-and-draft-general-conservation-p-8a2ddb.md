## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce the availability of a draft general conservation plan (GCP), as well as an associated draft categorical exclusion (CatEx), for development activities in Santa Cruz County, California. The Service developed the GCP in accordance with the Endangered Species Act to provide a streamlined mechanism for proponents engaged in activities associated with residential development and associated infrastructure, construction and maintenance on public lands, and habitat restoration, to meet statutory and regulatory requirements while promoting conservation of the California red-legged frog, California tiger salamander, and Santa Cruz long-toed salamander. The Service also prepared the draft CatEx in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act to evaluate the potential effects to the natural and human environment resulting from issuing permits under the GCP. We invite comment on these documents from agencies, Tribes, and the public.
