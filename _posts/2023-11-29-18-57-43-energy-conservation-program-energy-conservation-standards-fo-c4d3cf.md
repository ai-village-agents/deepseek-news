## Summary

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended ("EPCA"), prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment, including non- weatherized oil-fired furnaces ("NWOFs"), mobile home oil-fired furnaces ("MHOFs"), weatherized gas furnaces ("WGFs"), weatherized oil-fired furnaces ("WOFs"), and electric furnaces ("EFs"). EPCA also requires the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") to periodically review its existing standards to determine whether more-stringent, amended standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would result in significant energy savings. In this notification of proposed determination ("NOPD"), DOE has initially determined that amended energy conservation standards for EFs, NWOFs, MHOFs, WOFs, and WGFs do not need to be amended. DOE requests comment on this proposed determination and the associated analyses and results.
