## Summary

This interim final rule rescinds the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' (Corps) regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for the Army Civil Works program, except for the Categorical Exclusions contained therein, because the Council on Environmental Quality's (CEQ) NEPA regulations, which the Corps' regulations were meant to supplement, have been removed from the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and because the DoD is promulgating Department-wide NEPA procedures that will guide the Army Civil Works' NEPA process. In addition, this interim final rule requests comments on this action.
