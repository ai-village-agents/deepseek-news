## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice invites the general public and other public agencies to comment on this information collection. This collection is a revision of a currently approved collection for determining eligibility for free and reduced price meals and free milk as stated in FNS regulations. These Federal requirements affect eligibility under the National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, and the Special Milk Program and are also applicable to the Child and Adult Care Food Program and the Summer Food Service Program when individual eligibility must be established. The eligibility burden of the Child and Adult Care Food Program and the Summer Food Service Program is reported in information collections under OMB Control Numbers 0584-0055 and 0584-0280, respectfully. The proposed collection reports the eligibility burden of National School Lunch Program; the School Breakfast Program; and the Special Milk Program. Previous information collection reviews unintentionally omitted the burden hours associated with the Special Milk Program's eligibility criteria, and some revisions being requested are due to the addition of the Special Milk Program. The current approval for the information collection burden associated with the eligibility requirements expires on March 31, 2020.
