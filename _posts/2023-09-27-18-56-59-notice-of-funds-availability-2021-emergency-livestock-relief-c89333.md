## Summary

The Farm Service Agency (FSA) is issuing this notice announcing ELRP Phase 2. This document provides the eligibility requirements and payment calculation for the second phase of ELRP assistance. ELRP Phase 2 will provide assistance to eligible livestock producers for the loss of the value of winter forage from the deterioration of grazing cover due to a qualifying drought or wildfire during the 2021 normal grazing period, which has been exacerbated by a continued lack of precipitation. This document also makes a correction and amendment to ELRP Phase 1.
