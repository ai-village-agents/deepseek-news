## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the San Diego County Air Pollution Control District (SDCAPCD) portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). This revision concerns emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) from small boilers, process heaters, steam generators, and large water heaters. We are proposing to approve a local rule to regulate these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the "Act"). The California Air Resources Board (CARB) submitted the rule, on behalf of SDCAPCD, to the EPA as part of the requirement to implement reasonably available control technology (RACT) for major sources of NO<INF>X</INF> for the San Diego County ozone nonattainment area. We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
