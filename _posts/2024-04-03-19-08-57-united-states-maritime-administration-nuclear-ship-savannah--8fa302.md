## Summary

On October 23, 2023, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) received from the United States Maritime Administration (MARAD, the licensee) a license amendment request to include a License Termination Plan (LTP) for the Nuclear Ship Savannah (NS Savannah). The LTP provides details about the known radiological information for the ship, the planned demolition and decommissioning tasks to be completed, and the final radiological surveys and data that must be obtained for termination of the NRC's license for NS Savannah. The NRC is requesting public comments on NS Savannah's LTP and will hold a public meeting to discuss the LTP.
