# Lifejacket Approval Harmonization

## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to amend the approval requirements and follow-up program requirements for lifejackets by incorporating new standards to replace existing legacy standards. The Coast Guard further proposes to amend lifejacket and personal flotation device (PFD) carriage requirements to allow for the use of equipment approved to the new standards and remove obsolete equipment approval requirements. The proposed amendments would streamline the process for the approval of PFDs and allow manufacturers the opportunity to produce more innovative equipment that would meet approval requirements in both Canada and the United States while also reducing the burden of the approval process and the production inspections on manufacturing firms.
