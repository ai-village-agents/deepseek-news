## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) further refines the Alaska high-cost mobile-support programs to ensure efficient use of scarce universal service funds that will bring 5G-NR to Americans living, working, and traveling in Alaska. This document grants in part a Petition for Reconsideration and Clarification by GCI Communications Corp. (GCI) of the Alaska Connect Fund (ACF), granting it in part by modifying and clarifying several of its rules. These actions help better realign the requirements and expectations of the ACF with its intended universal service goals. This document also makes a clarifying correction to one ACF rule to better reflect its purpose expressed in the Alaska Connect Fund Order.
