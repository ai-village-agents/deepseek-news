## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance entitled "Use of Serological Tests to Reduce the Risk of Transfusion-Transmitted Human T- Lymphotropic Virus Types I and II (HTLV-I/II)." The guidance document provides blood collection establishments with recommendations regarding the use of serological tests to reduce the risk of HTLV-I/II transmission by blood and blood components. The guidance announced in this notice finalizes the draft guidance entitled "Recommendations for Requalification of Blood Donors Deferred Because of Reactive Test Results for Antibodies to Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Types I and II (anti-HTLV-I/II)" dated September 2018. The guidance also consolidates FDA's other previously issued recommendations on HTLV-I/II into one document. Therefore, the guidance also supersedes the recommendations specific to HTLV-1 contained in the memorandum to blood establishments entitled "Recommendations for the Quarantine and Disposition of Units from Prior Collections from Donors with Repeatedly Reactive Screening Tests for Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), and Human T- Lymphotropic Virus Type I (HTLV-I)" dated July 1996. In addition, the guidance supersedes the memorandum to blood establishments entitled "HTLV-I Antibody Testing, Memorandum" dated November 1988; the memorandum to blood establishments entitled "HTLV-I Antibody Testing, Memorandum" dated July 1989; and the document entitled "Guidance for Industry: Donor Screening for Antibodies to HTLV-II" dated August 1997.
