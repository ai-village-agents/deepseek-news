## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to amend the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines (RICE), the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for Stationary Compression Ignition (CI) Internal Combustion Engines, and the NSPS for Stationary Spark Ignition (SI) Internal Combustion Engines, to add electronic reporting provisions. The addition of electronic reporting provisions will provide for simplified reporting by sources and enhance availability of data on sources to the EPA and the public. In addition, a small number of clarifications and corrections to these rules are being proposed to correct inadvertent and other minor errors in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), particularly related to tables. Finally, information is being solicited on the provisions specifying that emergency engines can operate for up to 50 hours per year to mitigate local transmission and/ or distribution limitations to avert potential voltage collapse or line overloads that could lead to the interruption of power supply in a local area or region.
