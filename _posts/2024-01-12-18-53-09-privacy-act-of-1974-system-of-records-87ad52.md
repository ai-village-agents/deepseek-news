## Summary

The Department of the Interior (DOI) is issuing a public notice of its intent to rescind four Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Privacy Act systems of records notices (SORNs): INTERIOR/BLM-10, Vehicle Use Authorization; INTERIOR/BLM-18, Criminal Case Investigation; INTERIOR/BLM-19, Civil Trespass Case Investigations; and INTERIOR/BLM-30, Uniform Accountability System, from its existing inventory. During an annual review it was determined they are duplicative and covered by other DOI published SORNs. This rescindment will promote the overall streamlining and management of DOI's Privacy Act systems of records.
