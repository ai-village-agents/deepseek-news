## Summary

This document provides the public with notice that, on July 14, 2023, the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) submitted a request for amendment (RFA) to its FRA-approved Positive Train Control Safety Plan (PTCSP) in order to add information on UP's Arrangement of its Onboard positive train control (PTC) Apparatus, to correct regulatory reference formatting, and to add a PTCSP section reference. As this RFA may involve a request for FRA's approval of proposed material modifications to an FRA-certified PTC system, FRA is publishing this notice and inviting public comment on UP's RFA to its PTCSP.
