## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class D and Class E airspace and to revoke Class E airspace at Cape Girardeau Regional Airport, Cape Girardeau, MO. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of an airspace review caused by the decommissioning of the Marion VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) navigation aid as part of the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program. The name of the localizer would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
