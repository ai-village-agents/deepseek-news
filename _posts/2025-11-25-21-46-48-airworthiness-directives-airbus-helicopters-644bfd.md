## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-26- 07, which applies to all Airbus Helicopters Model EC120B helicopters. AD 2021-26-07 requires performing repetitive inspections of the tail rotor (TR) hub body and, depending on the inspection results, replacing certain parts, and accomplishing further inspections. AD 2021-26-07 also requires for certain helicopters removing from service any bolt, washer, and nut installed on the TR hub body at certain life limits and replacing them with airworthy parts and accomplishing further inspections. Additionally, AD 2021-26-07 prohibits the installation of a certain part-numbered TR hub body unless certain requirements are met. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-26-07, it was determined that modifying the link of the TR hub body and splined flange by adding red paint marks is necessary to enable the detection of any loss of tightening torque. This AD retains the same repetitive inspections and corrective actions as AD 2021-26-07 and requires modification of the link of the TR hub body, which is a terminating action for the repetitive inspections. This AD also requires repetitive inspections of the red paint line added during the modification of the link of the TR hub body for alignment. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
