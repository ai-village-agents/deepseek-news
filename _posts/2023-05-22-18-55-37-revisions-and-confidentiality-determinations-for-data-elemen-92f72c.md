## Summary

The EPA is issuing this supplemental proposal that would amend specific provisions in the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule to improve the quality and consistency of the rule by providing for the collection of improved data that would better inform and be relevant to a wide variety of Clean Air Act provisions that the EPA carries out. The EPA recently evaluated the requirements of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule to identify areas of improvement, including updates to the existing calculation, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements, and requested information for collection of additional data to understand new source categories in a proposed rule (June 21, 2022). In this notification, the EPA is proposing additional amendments to the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule, including updates to the General Provisions to reflect revised global warming potentials, and is proposing to require reporting of greenhouse gas data from additional sectors--specifically energy consumption; coke calcining; ceramics production; calcium carbide production; and caprolactam, glyoxal, and glyoxylic acid production. The EPA is also proposing additional revisions that would improve implementation of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule, such as updates to emissions calculation methodologies; revisions to reporting requirements to improve verification of reported data and the accuracy of the data collected; and other minor technical amendments, corrections, or clarifications. The EPA intends to consider the information received in response to this supplemental proposal prior to finalizing the amendments to the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule proposed on June 21, 2022. This action also proposes to establish and amend confidentiality determinations for the reporting of certain data elements to be added or substantially revised in these proposed amendments.
