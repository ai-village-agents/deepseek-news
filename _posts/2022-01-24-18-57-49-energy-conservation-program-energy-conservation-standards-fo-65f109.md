# Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Dedicated-Purpose Pool Pumps

## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is initiating an effort to determine whether to amend the current energy conservation standards for dedicated-purpose pool pumps ("DPPPs"). Under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended, DOE must review these standards at least once every six years and publish either a notice of proposed rulemaking ("NOPR") to propose new standards for DPPPs or a notification of determination that the existing standards do not need to be amended. This request for information ("RFI") solicits information from the public to help DOE determine whether amended standards for DPPPs would result in significant energy savings and whether such standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified. DOE also welcomes written comments from the public on any subject within the scope of this document (including those topics not specifically raised), as well as the submission of data and other relevant information.
