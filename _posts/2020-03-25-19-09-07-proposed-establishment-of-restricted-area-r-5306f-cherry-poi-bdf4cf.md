# Proposed Establishment of Restricted Area R-5306F; Cherry Point, NC

## Summary

This action proposes to establish restricted area R-5306F at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Cherry Point, NC. R-5306F would extend from flight level (FL) 180 to FL 290. The proposed restricted area would overlie the existing restricted area R-5306A, and the adjacent Core Military Operations Area (MOA). Due to altitude constraints, the existing restricted airspace structure around MCAS Cherry Point cannot fully support the training requirements for current legacy aircraft as well as 4th and 5th generation aircraft such as the F-35. In conjunction with R-5306A, the proposed restricted area would provide realistic training to enable pilots and aircrews to counter evolving threat nation warfare anti-aircraft capabilities.
