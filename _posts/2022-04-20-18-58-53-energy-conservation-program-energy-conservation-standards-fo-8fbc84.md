## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is undertaking a review for amended energy conservation standards for small electric motors to determine whether to amend applicable energy conservation standards for this equipment. Specifically, through this request for information ("RFI"), DOE seeks data and information to evaluate whether amended energy conservation standards would result in significant savings of energy; be technologically feasible; and be economically justified. DOE welcomes written comments from the public on any subject within the scope of this document (including those topics not specifically raised in this RFI), as well as the submission of data and other relevant information concerning this RFI.
