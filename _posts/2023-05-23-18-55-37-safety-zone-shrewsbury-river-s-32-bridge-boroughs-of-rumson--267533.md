## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone on the navigable waters of the Shrewsbury River, within a 100-yard radius of the center point of the S-32 Bridge on County Route 520 (Rumson Road), in the boroughs of Rumson and Sea Bright, New Jersey. The safety zone will include the East and West navigational channels and will temporarily close down a portion of the Shrewsbury River under the S-32 Bridge. The safety zone is needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards associated with the bridge construction. When enforced, entry of vessels or persons into this zone during the enforcement periods is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port New York or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
