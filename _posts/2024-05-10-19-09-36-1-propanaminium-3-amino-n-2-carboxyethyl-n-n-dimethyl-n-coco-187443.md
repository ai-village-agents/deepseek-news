## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of 1-propanaminium, 3-amino-N-(2- carboxyethyl)-N,N-dimethyl-, N-coco acyl derivatives, inner salts (CAS Reg. No. 499781-63-4) when used as an inert ingredient (adjuvant or surfactant) on growing crops and raw agricultural commodities pre- and post-harvest. This regulation also establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of 1-propanaminium, 3-amino-N- (carboxymethyl)-N,N-dimethyl-, N-coco acyl derivatives, hydroxides, inner salts (CAS Reg. No. 61789-40-0), also known as cocamidopropyl betaine, when used as an inert ingredient (surfactant) on growing crops pre-harvest. Oxiteno USA, LLC and Bi-PA NV, respectively, each submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for each of these substances. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of 1-propanaminium, 3- amino-N-(2-carboxyethyl)-N,N-dimethyl-, N-coco acyl derivatives, inner salts; and cocamidopropyl betaine when used in accordance with the terms of these exemptions.
