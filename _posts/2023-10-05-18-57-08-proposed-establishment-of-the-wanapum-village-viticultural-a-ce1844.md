## Summary

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) is soliciting comments on a proposal to change the name of the proposed "Wanapum Village" American viticultural area (AVA) to "Beverly, Washington." The proposed AVA area is located in Grant County, Washington and is entirely within the existing Columbia Valley AVA. TTB designates viticultural areas to allow vintners to better describe the origin of their wines and to allow consumers to better identify wines they may purchase. TTB invites comments on these proposals.
