## Summary

On June 19, 2020, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) solicited comments on the post-shutdown decommissioning activities report (PSDAR) for the Duane Arnold Energy Center (DAEC). The PSDAR, which includes the site-specific decommissioning cost estimate (DCE), provides an overview of NextEra Energy Duane Arnold, LLC's (NEDA or the licensee's) planned decommissioning activities, schedule, projected costs, and environmental impacts for DAEC. The public comment period closed on October 19, 2020, was reopened on October 26, 2020, and closed again on February 19, 2021. The NRC has decided to reopen the public comment period for a second time to provide additional time for members of the public to develop and submit their comments, as well as to allow time for an in-person public meeting on the PSDAR. The NRC will hold a public meeting to discuss the PSDAR's content and receive comments once restrictions associated with the Coronavirus Disease 2019 public health emergency are lifted.
