## Summary

The Commission instituted the subject five-year reviews on January 2, 2024, to determine whether revocation of the countervailing duty order on rubber bands from China and the antidumping duty orders on rubber bands from China and Thailand would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury. On March 21, 2024, the Department of Commerce published notice in the Federal Register that it was revoking the orders because no domestic interested party filed a timely notice of intent to participate. The effective date of the revocation of the antidumping and countervailing duty orders on imports of rubber bands from China is February 19, 2024. The effective date of the revocation of the antidumping duty order on imports of rubber bands from Thailand is April 26, 2024. Accordingly, the subject reviews are terminated.
