## Summary

This action reopens the comment period for the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) published on May 23, 2023, titled "Removal of Expiration Date on a Flight Instructor Certificate; Additional Qualification Requirements To Train Initial Flight Instructor Applicants; and Other Provisions." The proposed amendments would function to remove the expiration date from a flight instructor certificate, establish recent experience requirements, expand certain certificate reinstatement options for flight instructors, amend qualification requirements for flight instructors seeking to provide training to initial flight instructor applicants, and codify the requirements of a Special Federal Aviation Regulation. The FAA is reopening the comment period to allow commenters an additional opportunity to provide feedback on this proposed rule.
