## Summary

In response to a request from the Alliance for Automotive Innovation (Auto Innovators), NHTSA is announcing a reopening of the comment period on an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) published December 10, 2020. The ANPRM requests public comment on whether any test procedure for any Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) may be a candidate for replacement, repeal, or modification, for reasons other than for considerations relevant only to automated driving systems (ADS). The comment period for the ANPRM was originally scheduled to end on February 8, 2021. It will now be reopened and will end on April 9, 2021.
