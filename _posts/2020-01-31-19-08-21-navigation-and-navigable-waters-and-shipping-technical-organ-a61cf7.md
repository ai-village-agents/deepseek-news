## Summary

The Coast Guard is issuing non-substantive technical, organizational, and conforming amendments to existing regulations for District 1. These changes reflect the current status of the identified regulated navigation areas, special local regulations, safety zones and security zones within the district. This rule removes safety zones and special local regulations where the enforcement period has expired or the event is no longer held. This rule also removes special local regulations where the event no longer meets the criteria for a permitted event and is not suitable for coverage under a special local regulation in accordance with Coast Guard regulations.
