## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE" or "the Department") will hold a webinar to discuss and receive comments on the preliminary analysis it has conducted for purposes of evaluating energy conservation standards for miscellaneous refrigeration products ("MREFs"). The meeting will cover the analytical framework, models, and tools that DOE is using to evaluate potential standards for these products; the results of preliminary analyses performed by DOE; the potential energy conservation standard levels derived from these analyses that DOE could consider for this product should it determine that proposed amendments are necessary; and any other issues relevant to the evaluation of energy conservation standards for MREFs. In addition, DOE encourages written comments on these subjects. To inform interested parties and to facilitate this process, DOE has prepared an agenda, a preliminary technical support document ("TSD"), and briefing materials, which are available on the DOE website at: www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/ standards.aspx?productid=39&action=viewlive.
