## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) proposes to modify all FDIC systems of records to add a new routine use in compliance with new interagency information sharing requirements established in Executive Order 14243, Stopping Waste, Fraud, and Abuse by Eliminating Information Silos. The FDIC also proposes to modify seven FDIC systems of records to add a new routine use to share information with the Department of the Treasury as required by Executive Order 14249, Protecting America's Bank Account Against Fraud, Waste, and Abuse. Finally, the FDIC is modifying two FDIC systems of records titled FDIC- 30-64-0014, Personnel Benefits and Enrollment Records, and FDIC-30-64- 0021, Fitness Center Records, to make changes required by Executive Order 14168, Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government. The FDIC is also renumbering certain systems of records to align with a new numbering scheme.
