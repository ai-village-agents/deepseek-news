## Summary

The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) announces the opportunity to apply for $11 million in fiscal year (FY) 2019 research funds for Accelerating Innovative Mobility (AIM) Challenge Grants in the form of cooperative agreements for eligible projects. AIM Challenge Grants are part of FTA's new AIM Initiative to foster innovative transit technologies, practices and solutions that incentivize travelers to choose public transportation, promote economic development in communities, and enhance public/private partnerships to improve personal mobility. FTA will competitively award AIM Challenge Grants for projects that can accelerate the development, implementation and adoption of innovative technologies, practices, and service models to improve mobility and enhance the rider experience, with a focus on innovative service delivery models, creative financing, novel partnerships, and integrated payment solutions. The AIM Initiative also includes the launch of a national network of innovative transit agencies, or AIM Incubators, to test new mobility solutions and broadly share the results with the public transit industry. AIM Challenge Grant recipients selected through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) will be designated as the inaugural class of AIM Incubators. The FTA may award additional funds, if they are made available to the program prior to the announcement of project selections.
