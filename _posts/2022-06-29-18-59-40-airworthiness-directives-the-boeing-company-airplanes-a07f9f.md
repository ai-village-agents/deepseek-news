## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-700, -800, and -900ER series airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of incorrectly installed fuselage skin fasteners. This AD requires a detailed inspection of a certain body station bulkhead, between certain stringers, for any incorrectly installed fastener common to fuselage skin, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
