## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), list the sand dune phacelia (Phacelia argentea), a plant species from coastal southern Oregon and northern California, as a threatened species with a rule issued under section 4(d) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). We also designate critical habitat for the species under the Act. In total, approximately 180.8 acres (73.2 hectares) within 13 units in Coos and Curry Counties in Oregon, and Del Norte County in California, fall within the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. This rule extends the protections of the Act to this species and its designated critical habitat.
