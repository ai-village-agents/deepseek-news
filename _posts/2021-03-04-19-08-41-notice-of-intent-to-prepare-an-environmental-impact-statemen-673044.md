## Summary

The U.S. Postal Service announces its intention to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the purchase over 10 years of 50,000 to 165,000 purpose-built, right-hand-drive vehicles--the Next Generation Delivery Vehicle (NGDV)--to replace existing delivery vehicles nationwide that are approaching the end of their service life. While the Postal Service has not yet determined the precise mix of the powertrains in the new vehicles to be purchased, current plans are for the new vehicle purchases to consist of a mix of internal combustion engine and battery electric powertrains; the purchases will also be designed to be capable of retrofits to keep pace with advances in electric vehicle technologies. The EIS will evaluate the environmental impacts of the purchase and operation of the NGDV, as well as a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) vehicle alternative and a "no action" alternative.
