## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2013-26-01 for all CFM International, S.A. (CFM) CFM56-3 and CFM56-7B model turbofan engines with a certain accessory gearbox assembly (AGB) not equipped with a dynamic oil seal assembly in the handcranking pad. AD 2013-26-01 required an independent inspection to verify re-installation of the handcranking pad cover after removal of the pad cover for maintenance. This AD was prompted by a dual engine loss of oil event and 42 prior events of total loss of engine oil during flight. This AD requires independent inspection to verify re-installation of the AGB handcranking pad cover after maintenance. This AD also requires the replacement of the affected AGB as a terminating action to the inspection requirement. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
