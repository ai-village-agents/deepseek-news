## Summary

Through this notice, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announces that the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) has decided to partially vacate the June 4, 2024, decision of former Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas regarding the extension of the designation of Haiti for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and the new designation of Haiti for TPS. In the 2024 action, former Secretary Mayorkas again extended the designation of Haiti for TPS for the statutory maximum of 18 months (until February 3, 2026), which covered approximately 199,445 Haitian nationals; and again newly designated Haiti for TPS, which had the effect of allowing approximately 321,349 additional Haitian nationals to qualify for the same 18-month period. For the reasons described in this notice, the Secretary has determined to partially vacate the June 4, 2024, decision by reducing the designation period from 18 months to 12 months. The Secretary is also making a corresponding change to the registration deadline for new applicants under the new designation. Accordingly, by operation of this notice, the Haiti TPS extension and new designation will expire on August 3, 2025, instead of February 3, 2026, and the first-time registration will remain in effect until August 3, 2025, instead of February 3, 2026.
