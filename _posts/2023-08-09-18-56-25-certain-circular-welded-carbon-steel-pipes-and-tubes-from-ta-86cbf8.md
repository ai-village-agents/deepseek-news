## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) determines that certain circular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes (pipe and tube) and circular welded non-alloy steel pipe (CWP) imported into the United States during the period of inquiry, January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2021, were not completed in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (Vietnam) using hot-rolled steel (HRS) manufactured in Taiwan, and, therefore, no such imports are circumventing the antidumping duty (AD) orders on pipe and tube and CWP from Taiwan.
