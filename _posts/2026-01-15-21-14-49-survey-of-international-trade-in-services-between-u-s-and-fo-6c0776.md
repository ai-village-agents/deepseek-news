## Summary

By this rule, the Department of Commerce is amending its regulations governing the collection of data on international trade in services and direct investment by removing certain provisions that merely restate what is clearly provided by the underlying statute and serve no meaningful purpose. The intended effect is to streamline such regulations, reduce regulatory clutter and complexity, and improve clarity for the public.
