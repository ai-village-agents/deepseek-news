## Summary

The EPA is proposing to grant the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RI DEM) the authority to implement and enforce the amended Rhode Island Code of Regulations, Control of Emissions from Organic Solvent Cleaning (Organic Solvent Cleaning Rule), and the General Definitions Regulation (General Definitions Rule) in place of the National Emission Standard for Halogenated Solvent Cleaning (Halogenated Solvent NESHAP) as a partial rule substitution as it applies to organic solvent cleaning machines in Rhode Island. Upon approval, RI DEM's amended Organic Solvent Cleaning Rule and General Definitions Rule would apply to all sources that otherwise would be regulated by the Halogenated Solvent NESHAP, except for continuous web cleaning machines, for which the Halogenated Solvent NESHAP would continue to apply. The EPA has reviewed RI DEM's request and has preliminarily determined that the State's amended Organic Solvent Cleaning Rule and General Definitions Rule satisfy the requirements necessary for approval. Thus, the EPA is proposing to approve the request. This approval would make RI DEM's amended Organic Solvent Cleaning Rule and General Definitions Rule federally enforceable. This action is being taken under the Clean Air Act (CAA).
