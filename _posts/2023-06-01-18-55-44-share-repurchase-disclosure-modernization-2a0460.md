## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") is adopting amendments to modernize and improve disclosure about repurchases of an issuer's equity securities that are registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The amendments require additional detail regarding the structure of an issuer's repurchase program and its share repurchases, require the filing of daily quantitative repurchase data either quarterly or semi-annually, and eliminate the requirement to file monthly repurchase data in an issuer's periodic reports. The amendments also revise and expand the existing periodic disclosure requirements about these repurchases. Finally, the amendments add new quarterly disclosure in certain periodic reports related to an issuer's adoption and termination of certain trading arrangements.
