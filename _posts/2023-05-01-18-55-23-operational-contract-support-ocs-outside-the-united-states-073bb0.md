## Summary

The DoD is updating the policies and procedures for operational contract support (OCS) outside the United States. These changes include broadening the range of applicable operational scenarios, eliminating content internal to the Department designating contractor personnel as part of the DoD total force, incorporating requirements for accountability and reporting, and clarifying responsibilities. With these updates, the Department addresses open recommendations from the Government Accountability Office (GAO).
