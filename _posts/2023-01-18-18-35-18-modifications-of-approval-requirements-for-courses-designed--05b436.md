## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is amending its regulations to implement the provisions of the Jeff Miller and Richard Blumenthal Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2016. This final rule adopts without change a proposed rule, which adds new approval requirements as specified in the statutory provisions for accredited and nonaccredited programs designed to prepare an individual for licensure and certification in a State, implements VA's new authority to waive the added approval requirements under certain circumstances and adjust the authority of a State approving agency to add new approval criteria, and adds a circumstance for disapproval of a program designed to prepare an individual for licensure and certification, as prescribed by the law we are implementing.
