## Summary

ONRR disburses certain monies generated from offshore oil and gas production on the Outer Continental Shelf ("OCS") in accordance with applicable laws. Through the enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), Congress amended the offshore distribution caps for these disbursements. ONRR is therefore amending its regulations to be consistent with these statutory changes.
