## Summary

The Coast Guard is amending and updating its safety zone regulations for annual events that take place in the Coast Guard Sector Ohio Valley area of responsibility (AOR). This action is necessary to update the current list of recurring safety zones with revisions, additional events, and removal of events that no longer take place in the Sector Ohio Valley. When these safety zones are enforced, certain restrictions are placed on marine traffic in specified areas.
