## Summary

The FAA is withdrawing the NPRM published in the Federal Register on September 4, 2020, proposing to amend VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airway V-456 which would serve as an alternative to the Colored Federal airway Green-11 (G-11). Subsequent to the NPRM, the FAA determined during a flight check inspection that the desired altitudes along the proposed route amendment for V-456 did not meet the expected criteria and determined that the withdrawal of the proposed rule is warranted.
