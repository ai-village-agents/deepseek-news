## Summary

In accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator's March 18, 2022, memorandum regarding "Consent Decrees and Settlement Agreements to resolve Environmental Claims Against the Agency," notice is hereby given of a proposed settlement agreement in Center for Biological Diversity v. EPA and FWS, No. 21-71306 (9th Cir.). In October 2021, Center for Biological Diversity (Plaintiff) filed a petition in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit challenging EPA's issuance of the 2021 Pesticide General Permit (PGP), a permit issued by EPA pursuant to the Clean Water Act (CWA). The petition alleged that EPA failed to comply with the CWA in issuing the 2021 PGP, and that EPA and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) failed to comply with the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in issuing the 2021 PGP. EPA seeks public input on a proposed settlement agreement prior to its final decision-making with regard to potential settlement of the litigation.
