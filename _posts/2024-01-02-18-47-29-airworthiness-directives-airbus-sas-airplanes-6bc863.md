## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-08- 04, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A300 series airplanes. AD 2022-08-04 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-08-04, the FAA has determined new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD continues to require the actions of AD 2022-08-04, and requires new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
