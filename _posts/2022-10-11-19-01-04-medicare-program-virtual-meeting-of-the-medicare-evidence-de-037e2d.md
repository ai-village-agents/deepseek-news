## Summary

This notice announces a virtual public meeting of the Medicare Evidence Development & Coverage Advisory Committee (MEDCAC) ("Committee") will be held on Wednesday, December 7, 2022. National Coverage Determinations resulting in coverage with evidence development (CED) can expedite earlier Medicare beneficiary access to innovative technology while ensuring that systematic patient safeguards are in place to reduce the risks inherent to new technologies, or to new applications of older technologies. This meeting will examine the general requirements for clinical studies submitted for CMS coverage requiring CED. The MEDCAC will evaluate the CED criteria to assure that CED studies are evaluated with consistent, feasible, transparent and methodologically rigorous criteria and advise CMS on whether the criteria are appropriate to ensure that CED-approved studies will produce reliable evidence that CMS can rely on to help determine whether a particular item or service is reasonable and necessary. This meeting is open to the public in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act.
