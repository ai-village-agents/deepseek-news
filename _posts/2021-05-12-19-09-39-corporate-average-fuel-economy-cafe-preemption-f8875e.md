# Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Preemption

**Published:** February 05, 2026 19:09 UTC
**Source:** Federal Register
**Original Published:** May 12, 2021 00:00 UTC
**Document Number:** 2021-08758

## Summary

This document proposes to repeal "The Safer Affordable Fuel- Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule Part One: One National Program," published Sept. 27, 2019 (SAFE I Rule), in which NHTSA codified regulatory text and made additional pronouncements regarding the preemption of state and local laws related to fuel economy standards. Specifically, this document proposes to fully repeal the regulatory text and appendices promulgated in the SAFE I Rule. In addition, this document proposes to repeal and withdraw the interpretative statements made by the Agency in the SAFE I Rule preamble, including those regarding the preemption of particular state Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions standards or Zero Emissions Vehicle (ZEV) mandates. As such, this document proposes to establish a clean slate with respect to NHTSA's regulations and interpretations concerning preemption under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA).
