## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing for public comment draft regulatory guide (DG), DG-1381, "Control of Heavy Loads at Nuclear Facilities." This DG is a proposed new regulatory guide to endorse selected national consensus standards related to heavy load handling that replace NRC technical reports. The national consensus standards provide greater flexibility in the selection of lifting equipment and have incorporated recent operating experience to provide a more accurate risk-informed perspective of heavy load handling activities.
