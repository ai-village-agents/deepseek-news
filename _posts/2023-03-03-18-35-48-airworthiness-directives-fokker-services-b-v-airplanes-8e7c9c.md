## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Fokker Services B.V. Model F28 Mark 0070 and 0100 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of cracks at the upper and lower fastener holes of a repair plate in the stubwing, which had been applied to repair heat damage. This AD requires a one-time inspection of the fuselage skin in the stubwing bay area to determine if a heat damage repair plate is installed, an inspection of repaired areas for cracking, and applicable corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
