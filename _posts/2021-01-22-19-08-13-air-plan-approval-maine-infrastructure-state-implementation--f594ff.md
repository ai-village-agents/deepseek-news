## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Maine. This revision addresses the infrastructure requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) for the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Today's proposed action includes all elements of these infrastructure requirements except for the "Good Neighbor" or "transport" provisions, which will be addressed in a future action. The infrastructure requirements are designed to ensure that the structural components of each state's air quality management program are adequate to meet the state's responsibilities under the CAA. EPA is also proposing to approve State of Maine submittals of amendments to Chapter 110, Ambient Air Quality Standards, and of statutory conflict-of-interest provisions in 38 Maine Revised Statutes Annotated (MRSA) Section 341-A and 341-C. These two submittals support the state's infrastructure submittal for the 2015 ozone NAAQS. In addition, we are proposing to convert previous conditional approvals of the sub-element of section 110(a)(2)(E) that addresses State Board Requirements in Maine's infrastructure SIPs for the 2008 ozone; 2008 lead (Pb); 2010 nitrogen dioxide (NO<INF>2</INF>); 2010 sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>); 1997, 2006, and 2012 fine particle (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) NAAQS to full approvals. We are also proposing to convert to full approval previous conditional approvals of section 110(a)(2)(A) (Emission limits and other control measures) in Maine's infrastructure SIPS for the 1997 and 2006 PM<INF>2.5</INF>. Finally, EPA is proposing to approve SIP revisions submitted by Maine that provide the state's determination, via a negative declaration for the 2008 and 2015 ozone standards, that there are no facilities within its borders subject to EPA's 2016 Control Technique Guideline (CTG) for the oil and gas industry. This action is being taken under the Clean Air Act.
