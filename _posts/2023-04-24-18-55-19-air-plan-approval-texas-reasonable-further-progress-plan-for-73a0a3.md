## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving revisions to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) for Texas as proposed on October 9, 2020, and supplemented on December 20, 2022. The revisions were submitted by Texas on May 13, 2020, to meet the Reasonable Further Progress (RFP) requirements for the Dallas-Fort Worth Serious ozone nonattainment area (DFW area) for the 2008 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). Specifically, EPA is approving the RFP demonstration and associated Motor Vehicle Emission Budgets (budgets). EPA is also notifying the public that EPA finds these RFP budgets for the DFW area adequate for the purpose of transportation conformity. As a result of such finding, the DFW area must use the budgets from the submitted DFW RFP SIP for future conformity determinations. The EPA is not finalizing a previous proposed approval of revisions to the SIP that address RFP contingency measure requirements for the DFW area in this action and that will be addressed in a separate action.
