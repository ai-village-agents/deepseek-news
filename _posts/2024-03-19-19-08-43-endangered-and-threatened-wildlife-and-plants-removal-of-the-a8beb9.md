## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to remove the North Park phacelia (Phacelia formosula) from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Plants due to recovery. The best available scientific information indicates that threats to North Park phacelia identified at the time of listing in 1982 are not as significant as originally anticipated and are being adequately managed. Additionally, recent taxonomic studies have indicated that the species has four new populations and an expanded range in Colorado based on the inclusion of plants previously thought to be different species or subspecies. We find that delisting the species is warranted. Our review of the best available scientific and commercial data indicates that the threats to the North Park phacelia have been eliminated or reduced to the point that the species no longer meets the definition of an endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Accordingly, we propose to delist the North Park phacelia. We request information and comments from the public regarding this proposed rule and the draft post-delisting monitoring (PDM) plan for the North Park phacelia. If we finalize this rule as proposed, the prohibitions and conservation measures provided by the Act, particularly through sections 7 and 9, would no longer apply to the species.
