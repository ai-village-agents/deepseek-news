## Summary

NMFS is correcting a final rule for in-season action announcement procedures for commercial Pacific bluefin tuna (PBF) that appeared in the Federal Register on January 27, 2023. In that rule, NMFS did not address a public comment because of an error on the deadline for comment submissions. This correction responds to the comment, which does not change the action in the January 27 final rule.
