## Summary

The FAA is revising a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that would have applied to certain Airbus Helicopters Model EC225LP helicopters. This action revises the NPRM by removing the requirement to remove main rotor (M/R) rotating swashplates (swashplates) from service that have accumulated less than 7 years since the date of manufacture; increasing the life limit for certain swashplates; requiring additional visual inspections, and adding repetitive inspections for certain swashplates that have accumulated 7 or more years, but less than 13 years, since the date of manufacture; and updating the service information. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive (AD) to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over those in the NPRM, the agency is requesting comments on this SNPRM.
