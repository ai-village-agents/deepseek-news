## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-19-15 for certain International Aero Engines, LLC (IAE LLC) Model PW1100G series engines; and AD 2023-16-07 for certain IAE LLC Model PW1100G series engines and PW1400G series engines. AD 2022-19-15 required an angled ultrasonic inspection (AUSI) of the high-pressure turbine (HPT) 1st-stage disk and HPT 2nd-stage disk, and replacement, if necessary. AD 2023-16-07 required an AUSI of the HPT 1st-stage hub (also known as the HPT 1st-stage disk) and HPT 2nd-stage hub (also known as the HPT 2nd-stage disk) for cracks, and replacement, if necessary, which is terminating action for AD 2022-19-15. This AD was prompted by an investigation that determined an increased risk of powdered metal anomalies for all powdered metal parts in certain powdered metal production campaigns, which are susceptible to failure significantly earlier than previously determined. This AD retains the AUSI requirement for certain HPT 1st-stage and HPT 2nd-stage hubs from AD 2023-16-07. This AD requires performing an AUSI of the HPT 1st-stage hub, HPT 2nd-stage hub, high-pressure compressor (HPC) 7th-stage integrally bladed rotor (IBR-7), and HPC 8th-stage integrally bladed rotor (IBR-8) for cracks, and replacing if necessary. This AD also requires accelerated replacement of the HPC IBR-7, HPC IBR-8, HPC rear hub, HPT 1st-stage hub, and HPT 2nd-stage hub. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
