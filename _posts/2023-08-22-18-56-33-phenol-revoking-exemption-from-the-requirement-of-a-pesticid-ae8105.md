# Phenol; Revoking Exemption From the Requirement of a Pesticide Tolerance

## Summary

EPA is proposing to revoke the tolerance exemption for residues of the antimicrobial pesticide ingredient phenol when used as an inert ingredient (solvent/cosolvent) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops. This rulemaking is proposed on the Agency's own initiative under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) to implement a tolerance action the Agency determined was appropriate during the registration review conducted under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) for phenol. EPA is proposing to revoke this tolerance exemption because it corresponds to a use no longer current or registered under FIFRA in the United States.
