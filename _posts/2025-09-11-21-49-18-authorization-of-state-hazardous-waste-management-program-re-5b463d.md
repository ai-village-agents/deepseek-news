## Summary

California has applied to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for final authorization of changes to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended. The EPA has reviewed California's application and has determined, subject to public comment, that these changes satisfy all requirements needed to qualify for final authorization. Therefore, in the "Rules and Regulations" section of this Federal Register, we are authorizing California for these changes as a final action without a prior proposed rulemaking. If we receive no adverse comment, we will not take further action on this proposed rule.
