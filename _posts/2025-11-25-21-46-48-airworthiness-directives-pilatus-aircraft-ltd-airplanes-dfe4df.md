## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Pilatus Aircraft Ltd. (Pilatus) Model PC-24 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of an inaccurate flight director calculation on approach. This AD requires incorporating a temporary revision into the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) for the affected airplanes, which revises the Abnormal Procedures Section. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
