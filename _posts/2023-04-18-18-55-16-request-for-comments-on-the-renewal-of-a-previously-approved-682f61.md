## Summary

The Maritime Administration (MARAD) invites public comments on our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The information collected in the proposed collection OMB 2133-0027 (Capital Construction Fund and Exhibits) is necessary for MARAD to determine an applicant's eligibility to enter a Capital Construction Fund (CCF) Agreement, and their compliance with the requirements of this program. This collection is being revised to include additional respondents, responses, and burden hours, due to the recent approval of the Defense Authorization Act of 2023 expanding the current pool of eligible CCF program participants. We are required to publish this notice in the Federal Register by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
