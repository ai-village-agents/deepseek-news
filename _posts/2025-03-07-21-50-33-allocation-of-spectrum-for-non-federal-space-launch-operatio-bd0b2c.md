## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) implements certain provisions of the Launch Communications Act (LCA) enacted September 26, 2024, governing the authorization and facilitation of commercial space operations in the 2025-2110 MHz, 2200- 2290 MHz, and 2360-2395 MHz bands (collectively, the LCA bands). To meet this statutory mandate, the Commission builds upon its action in the September 2023 Second Report and Order which, among other things, reallocated the 2025-2110 MHz and 2200-2290 MHz bands for non-Federal Space Operation on a secondary basis and adopted, for these two bands, space launch licensing framework. Specifically, the Commission reallocates the 2360-2395 MHz band on a secondary basis for Space Operation. Next, the Commission incorporates the 2360-2395 MHz band into its existing part 26 space launch regulatory framework that includes, for example, space launch licensing and frequency coordination rules. In order to protect critical Federal and non- Federal flight testing operations, we incorporate into our certain technical rules from our current. Finally, the Commission confirms that the specific licensing, registration, frequency coordination, and frequency coordinator selection procedures, to be refined by the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (Bureau or WTB) on delegated authority, will apply to the LCA bands.
