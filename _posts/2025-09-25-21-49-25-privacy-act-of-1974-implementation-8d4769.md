## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) adopts as final, with one technical change, a proposed rule to amend its regulations governing the confidentiality and release of VA records subject to the Privacy Act of 1974. This rulemaking exempts portions of the new "Law Enforcement Officer Evaluations (LEO Evals)--VA" (216VA10) system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 to prevent compromising the objectivity and fairness of the testing and evaluation process.
