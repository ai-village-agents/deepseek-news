## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) implements the Low Power Protection Act (LPPA or Act), as enacted on January 5, 2023. The LPPA provides certain low power television (LPTV) stations with a limited window of opportunity to apply for primary spectrum use status as Class A television stations. The LPPA sets forth eligibility criteria for stations seeking Class A designation that are similar to the eligibility criteria under the Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999 (CBPA), which permitted certain LPTV stations to convert to Class A status. This document seeks comment on how to implement the LPPA consistent with Congressional direction, including, inter alia, which stations are eligible to apply for Class A status under the LPPA, the application period and application filing requirements, and ongoing eligibility requirements.
