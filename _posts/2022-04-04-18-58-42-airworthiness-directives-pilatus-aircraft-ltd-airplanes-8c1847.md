## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Pilatus Aircraft Ltd. (Pilatus) Model PC-12/47E airplanes. This AD was prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as inward vent valves installed during production without chromate conversion coating on the bonding surface. This AD requires modifying the inward vent valves and prohibits installing unmodified inward vent valves. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
