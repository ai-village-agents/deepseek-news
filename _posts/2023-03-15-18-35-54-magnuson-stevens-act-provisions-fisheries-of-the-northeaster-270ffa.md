# Magnuson-Stevens Act Provisions; Fisheries of the Northeastern United States; Northeast Multispecies Fishery; Approval of 2023 and 2024 Sector Operations Plans and Allocation of 2023 Northeast Multispecies Annual Catch Entitlements

## Summary

We propose to approve sector operations plans and contracts, grant regulatory exemptions for fishing years 2023 and 2024, and propose Northeast multispecies allocations of annual catch entitlements to approved groundfish sectors for fishing year 2023. Approval of sector operations plans and contracts is necessary for sectors to operate and receive allocations of annual catch entitlements. This action is intended to allow limited access permit holders to continue to operate or form sectors, as authorized under the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan, and to exempt sectors from certain effort control regulations to improve the efficiency and economics of sector vessels.
