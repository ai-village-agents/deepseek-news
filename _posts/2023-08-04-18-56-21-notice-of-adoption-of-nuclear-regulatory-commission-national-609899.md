## Summary

The Department of Energy (DOE) is adopting the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documentation (including that of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), the NRC's predecessor agency), for operation of the Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) under DCPP's operating licenses from the NRC. DOE determined these documents adequate to satisfy DOE NEPA obligations related to its award of credits to Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), pursuant to the Civil Nuclear Credit (CNC) Program, for the continued operation of the DCPP under DCPP's current operating licenses issued by the NRC. Because the actions covered by this NRC NEPA documentation and the proposed action are substantially the same, DOE is republishing and adopting those NEPA documents as a final DOE Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).
