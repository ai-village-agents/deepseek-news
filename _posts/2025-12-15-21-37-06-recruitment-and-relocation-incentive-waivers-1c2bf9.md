## Summary

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing a final rule to expand the authority to approve waivers of the normal payment limitations on recruitment and relocation incentives. An expansion of the waiver approval authority provides agencies with access to higher payment limitations for these flexibilities without requesting approval from OPM. In addition, this final rule gives agencies flexibility to set the length of the required service period for recruitment incentives to a period less than 6 months but not more than 4 years, which aligns the service requirements for recruitment incentives with those for relocation incentives.
