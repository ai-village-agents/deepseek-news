## Summary

On March 25, 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") published a notification of a webinar and availability of preliminary technical support document for automatic commercial ice makers ("ACIMs"). The document announced a public meeting webinar would be held on April 25, 2022. Additionally, on March 24, 2022, DOE received a request from the Hoshizaki America, Inc. to move the webinar date due to a conflict with an industry-wide conference. To accommodate this scheduling issue, DOE is moving the public meeting webinar for ACIMs to Thursday, May 5, 2022.
