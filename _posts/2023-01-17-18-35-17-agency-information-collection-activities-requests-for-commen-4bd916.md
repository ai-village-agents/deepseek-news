## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on June 22, 2022. Aircraft registration is necessary to ensure personal accountability among all users of the National Airspace System (NAS). Aircraft registration also allows the FAA and law enforcement agencies to address non-compliance by providing the means for identifying an aircraft's owner and operator. This collection also permits individuals to de-register or update their record in the registration database.
