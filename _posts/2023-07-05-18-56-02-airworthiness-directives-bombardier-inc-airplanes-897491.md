## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-2B16 (604 Variant) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that a combination of system faults and procedural actions will cause the ground spoilers to deploy in the air. This proposed AD would require revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to add revised procedures. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
