## Summary

SBA is introducing a new pilot loan program (ALP Express Pilot) to provide to Certified Development Companies (CDCs) participating in the Accredited Lenders Program (ALP) increased delegated authority for 504 loans of $500,000 or less. These increased delegated authorities (ALP Express authority) were previously authorized under the Economic Aid to Hard-hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act (Economic Aid Act), but they expire on September 30, 2023. SBA will evaluate the use of the ALP Express Pilot and will make a recommendation to Congress as to whether these increased authorities should become permanent. SBA will limit the number of ALP Express Pilot loans to not more than fifteen percent (15%) of the total dollar amount of 504 loans made in any fiscal year.
