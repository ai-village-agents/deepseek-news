## Summary

The Commission revises its rules to restrict the Postal Service from increasing rates above the de minimis threshold for Market Dominant products more than once per fiscal year (through fiscal year 2030) and to restrict the Postal Service from setting workshare discounts farther away from their avoided costs. These revisions aim to support a system design that achieves the statutory objectives, considering the statutory factors.
