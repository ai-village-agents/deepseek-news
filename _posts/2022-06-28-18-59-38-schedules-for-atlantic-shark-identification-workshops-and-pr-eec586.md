## Summary

Free Atlantic Shark Identification Workshops and Safe Handling, Release, and Identification Workshops will be held in July, August, and September of 2022. Certain fishermen and shark dealers are required to attend a workshop to meet regulatory requirements and to maintain valid permits. Specifically, the Atlantic Shark Identification Workshop is mandatory for all federally permitted Atlantic shark dealers. The Safe Handling, Release, and Identification Workshop is mandatory for vessel owners and operators who use bottom longline, pelagic longline, or gillnet gear, and who have also been issued shark or swordfish limited access permits. Additional free workshops will be conducted later in 2022 and will be announced in a future notice. In addition, NMFS has implemented online recertification workshops for persons who have already taken an in-person training. Information about the online workshops is available on the Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Management Division's website (see SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION).
