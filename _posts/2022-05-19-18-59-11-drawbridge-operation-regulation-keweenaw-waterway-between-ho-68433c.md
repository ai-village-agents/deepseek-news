## Summary

The Coast Guard has issued a temporary deviation from the operating schedule that governs the US41 Bridge, mile 16.0, over the Keweenaw Waterway between the towns of Houghton and Hancock, Michigan. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT), who owns and operates the bridge, has requested a deviation that will test a change to the drawbridge operation schedule to determine whether a permanent change to the schedule is needed. The Coast Guard is seeking comments from the public regarding these proposed changes.
