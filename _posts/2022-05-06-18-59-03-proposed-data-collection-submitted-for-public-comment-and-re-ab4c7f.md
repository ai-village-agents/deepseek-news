## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Formative Respirator and Personal Protective Clothing Laboratory Testing. NIOSH proposes using questionnaires, physiological monitoring/ measurements, anthropometric measurements, respirator fit measurements, self-perception data, and biomechanical measurements to assess gaps in respirator and personal protective clothing use among the Unites States working population.
