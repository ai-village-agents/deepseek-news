## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily determines that the respondents selected for individual examination, Ceuta Produce S de R.L. de C.V. and its affiliate, Rancho la Memoria, S. de R.L. de C.V. (collectively, Ceuta) and Valores Horticolas Del Pacifico S.A. De C.V. (VALHPAC), complied with the Agreement Suspending the Antidumping Duty (AD) Investigation on Fresh Tomatoes from Mexico (2019 Agreement), for the period of review (POR) September 1, 2021, through August 31, 2022, except for certain instances of inconsequential and/or inadvertent noncompliance. We preliminarily determine that such noncompliance does not materially frustrate the purposes of the 2019 Agreement. Commerce also preliminarily determines that the 2019 Agreement continued to meet the statutory requirements under sections 734(c) and (d) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act) during the POR.
