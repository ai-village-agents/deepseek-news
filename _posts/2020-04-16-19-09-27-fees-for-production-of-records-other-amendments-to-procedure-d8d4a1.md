## Summary

Under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) may charge certain fees to recover the direct costs of providing specific FOIA services, such as duplication and searching for responsive records. The CPSC is proposing to amend its FOIA fee regulations to reflect more accurately the CPSC's direct costs of providing FOIA services, as well as to conform to the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) Uniform Freedom of Information Act Fee Schedule and Guidelines and to omit the fee category for the production of records on microfiche, an obsolete format. The CPSC also is proposing to amend other sections of its FOIA regulations to reflect organizational changes in the agency's FOIA Office; to codify the existing practice of the General Counsel remanding cases to the Chief FOIA Officer; and to allow for any relevant FOIA exemptions to be applied.
