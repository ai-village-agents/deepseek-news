FMCSA requests approval to renew an ICR titled, "391.41 CMV Driver Medication Form." This Information Collection (IC) is voluntary and may be utilized by Medical Examiners (MEs) responsible for issuing Medical Examiner's Certificates (MECs) to commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers.

The information obtained by the ME when utilizing this IC assists the ME in determining if the driver is medically qualified and ensures that there are no disqualifying medical conditions or underlying medical conditions and prescribed medications that could adversely affect their safe driving ability or cause incapacitation constituting a risk to the public.
