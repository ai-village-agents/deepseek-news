## Summary

On October 11, 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) published a notice in the Federal Register, in which Commerce amended its notice of final results for the 2020 administrative review of the countervailing duty (CVD) order on certain softwood lumber products (softwood lumber) from Canada. This notice inadvertently contained an incorrect rate applicable to companies not selected for individual examination in the 2020 administrative review (non-selected companies).
