## Summary

This final rule amends DHS regulations regarding two CBP trusted traveler programs: Global Entry and Secure Electronic Network for Travelers Rapid Inspection (SENTRI). CBP is amending regulations to make the Global Entry and SENTRI application fees uniform, provide a uniform standard regarding payment of the Global Entry and SENTRI application fees for minors, change the fee payment schedule and certain aspects of the application process for SENTRI, and incorporate SENTRI-specific regulations into DHS regulations. CBP is also amending regulations to address Global Entry expansion to preclearance facilities and eliminate the dedicated commuter lane systems cost fee.
