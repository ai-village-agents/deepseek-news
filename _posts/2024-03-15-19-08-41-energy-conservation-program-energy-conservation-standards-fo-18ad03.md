## Summary

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended ("EPCA"), prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment, including residential clothes washers ("RCWs"). In this direct final rule, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is adopting amended energy conservation standards for RCWs. DOE has determined that the amended energy conservation standards for these products would result in significant conservation of energy and are technologically feasible and economically justified.
