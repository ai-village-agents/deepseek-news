## Summary

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), as amended, and pursuant to the Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 343 (Hawaii Environmental Policy Act (HEPA)), the Pittsburgh District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) is preparing a draft General Reevaluation Report/Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (GRR/SEIS) to evaluate the opportunities to reduce the risk to life, safety and economic damages from flooding throughout the Ala Wai Watershed in Oahu, Hawaii. The Ala Wai Canal Flood Risk Management Study was authorized under Section 209 of the Flood Control Act of 1962. The study was completed in 2017 and resulted in a recommendation that was subsequently authorized for construction under Section 1401 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2018 (Authorized Project). The purpose of the GRR/SEIS is to reevaluate the Authorized Project and either confirm the Authorized Project or make a new recommendation that will include modifications to the Authorized Project. The non-Federal sponsor for this study is the City and County of Honolulu.
