## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is planning to submit an information collection request (ICR), "EPA's ENERGY STAR Program in the Residential Sector" (EPA ICR No. 2193.05, OMB Control No. 2060-0586) to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Before doing so, EPA is soliciting public comments on specific aspects of the proposed information collection as described below. This is a proposed extension of the ICR, which was approved through January 30, 2024. An Agency may not conduct or sponsor and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
