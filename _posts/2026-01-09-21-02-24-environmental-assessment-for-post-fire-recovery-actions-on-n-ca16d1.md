## Summary

The USDA Forest Service is preparing a nationwide environmental assessment to analyze the effects of post-fire recovery actions on National Forest System lands in the continental United States. The intent of this assessment is to identify general actions, issues, alternatives, and supporting analysis that are common to post wildfire activities that occur on National Forest System Lands to facilitate consistency and more efficient subsequent site specific decisions. Severe wildfires are happening more often, causing serious damage to our national forests and grasslands. These fires can harm forests, grasslands, and local economies, alter wildlife habitat, and create hazards for communities and infrastructure. Immediate post-fire recovery actions can help restore healthy forest conditions and reduce hazards. This environmental assessment will not authorize, fund, or carry out any site specific action. Post-fire recovery projects will be accomplished in accordance with land management plans. Site specific considerations, including any needed supplemental analysis, design criteria, mitigation measures, or findings, will be provided for in project-specific documentation and, if needed, supplemental environmental assessments or other analyses.
