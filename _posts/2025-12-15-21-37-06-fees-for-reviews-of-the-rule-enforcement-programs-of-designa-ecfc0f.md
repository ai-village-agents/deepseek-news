## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC" or "Commission") charges fees to designated contract markets and registered futures associations to recover the costs incurred by the Commission in the operation of its program of oversight of self- regulatory organization rule enforcement programs, specifically the National Futures Association ("NFA"), a registered futures association, and the designated contract markets. Fees collected from each self-regulatory organization are deposited in the Treasury of the United States as miscellaneous receipts. The calculation of the fee amounts charged for 2023 by this notice is based upon an average of actual program costs incurred during fiscal years ("FY") 2020, FY 2021, and FY 2022.
