## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice seeks comments on a proposed revision to the currently approved information collection in support of the Export Sales Reporting program. Specifically, FAS requests public comments regarding whether the collection of the proposed contract by contract information, rather than aggregated sales information, will help improve the timeliness and reliability of the data in USDA's Export Sales Reports; the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of the collection of information including validity of the methodology and assumption used; ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; and ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on those who are to report, including through the use of automated, electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or other forms of information technology.
