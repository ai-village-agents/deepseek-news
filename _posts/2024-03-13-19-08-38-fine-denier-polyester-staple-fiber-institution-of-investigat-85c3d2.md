## Summary

Following receipt of a petition for import relief, as filed on February 28, 2024, the Commission has instituted investigation No. TA- 201-078 pursuant to section 202 of the Trade Act of 1974 ("the Act") to determine whether fine denier polyester staple fiber ("fine denier PSF") is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing an article like or directly competitive with the imported article. The Commission has deemed the petition to have been filed on February 28, 2024. The Commission has determined that this investigation is "extraordinarily complicated," and will make its injury determination by July 9, 2024. The Commission will submit to the President the report required under section 202(f) of the Act within 180 days after the date on which the petition was filed, or by August 26, 2024.
