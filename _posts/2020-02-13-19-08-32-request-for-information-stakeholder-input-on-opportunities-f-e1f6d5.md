## Summary

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of the Director, Office of Disease Prevention (ODP) issues this Request for Information (RFI) to identify opportunities to foster and engage in partnerships and dialogue with stakeholders to advance prevention research. The ODP hopes this will help us determine areas where we can collaboratively advance prevention research priorities, training opportunities, and better meet the needs of our stakeholders. The ODP invites input from researchers in academia and industry, health care professionals, patient advocates and advocacy organizations, scientific or professional organizations, federal agencies, and other interested members of the public. Organizations are strongly encouraged to submit a single response that reflects the views of the organization and membership as a whole.
