## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Mission Support, Administration and Resources Management (OMS-ARM) is giving notice that it proposes to modify a system of records pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. The Labor and Employee Relations Information System (LERIS) is being modified to change the name and location of the system to Labor and Employee Relations Tracking System (LERTS), per a vendor change. Additionally, EPA is modifying the SORN previously published in 2014 to update the system manager name and to add applicable routine uses. The purpose of the system is to allow Labor and Employee Relations (LER) specialists to track, manage and report on a full spectrum of labor and employee relations cases throughout the Agency.
