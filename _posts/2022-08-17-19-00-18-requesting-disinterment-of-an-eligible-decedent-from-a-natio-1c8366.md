## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is amending its regulations governing disinterment of eligible decedents interred in VA national cemeteries to clarify that, if the individual who initiated the interment does not consent to a disinterment or is not alive to provide consent, or all living immediate family members are not in agreement, anyone seeking disinterment of an eligible decedent must obtain an order from a court or State instrumentality of competent jurisdiction to direct the disinterment.
