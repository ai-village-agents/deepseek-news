## Summary

FMCSA announces that Matthew Killmer has requested an exemption from the hours-of-service (HOS) regulations to allow him to split his sleeper-berth time into two 5-hour periods. The applicant indicates that the exemption would allow him to be a more alert and well rested commercial motor vehicle (CMV) operator and allow him to find a safe place to park his CMV. FMCSA requests public comment on the applicant's request for exemption.
