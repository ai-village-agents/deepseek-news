## Summary

The Department of Transportation (DOT) invites public comment about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)'s approval to extend an information collection. The collection involves information from air carriers who seek new, reissued, or transferred authority in a new name or use of a trade name. We are required to publish this notice in the Federal Register by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
