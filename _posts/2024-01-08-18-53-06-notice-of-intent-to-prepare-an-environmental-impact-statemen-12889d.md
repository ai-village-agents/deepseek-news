## Summary

New York City, through the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development ("HPD"), and the New York City Housing Authority ("NYCHA"), are providing Notice of Intent ("NOI") to prepare an EIS for the proposed Fulton Elliott-Chelsea Houses Redevelopment Project in Manhattan, New York. As part of the NYCHA Permanent Affordability Commitment Together ("PACT") Program, NYCHA intends to submit an application(s) to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") for: disposition of public housing, and conversion of Section 9 public housing subsidies to Section 8 Project Based Vouchers ("PBVs") under the HUD Rental Assistance Demonstration ("RAD") Program and Section 18 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 ("USHA") as amended. This NOI initiates the public scoping for the EIS, and provides project information on the proposed action, the proposed action's purpose and need, and the alternatives being considered for evaluation in the EIS. This NOI invites public comments on the environmental impacts that may be associated with the proposed action and alternatives.
