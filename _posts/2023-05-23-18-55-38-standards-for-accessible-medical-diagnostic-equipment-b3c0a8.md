## Summary

The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (hereafter, "Access Board" or "Board"), is issuing this notice of proposed rulemaking to remove the sunset provisions in the Board's existing accessibility standards for medical diagnostic equipment related to the low-height specifications for transfer surfaces, and replace them with a final specification for the low-transfer-height of medical diagnostic equipment used in the supine, prone, side-lying position and the seated position.
