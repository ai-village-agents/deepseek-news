## Summary

In a notice published in the Federal Register on August 24, 2023, FMCSA announced its plan to submit the "Truck and Bus Maintenance Requirements and Their Impact on Safety" Information Collection Request (ICR) to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval and invited public comment. The notice incorrectly stated that comments must be received on or before September 1, 2023, which needs to be corrected to allow for a 60-day comment period. This notice makes that correction.
