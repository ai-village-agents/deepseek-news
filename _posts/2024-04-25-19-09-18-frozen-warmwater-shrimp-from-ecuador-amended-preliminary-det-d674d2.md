## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) published a notice in the Federal Register on April 1, 2024, in which Commerce preliminarily determined that countervailable subsidies are being provided to producers and exporters of frozen warmwater shrimp (shrimp) from Ecuador. Based on comments filed by interested parties in this investigation, Commerce is amending the preliminary affirmative countervailing duty (CVD) determination on shrimp from Ecuador to correct significant ministerial errors.
