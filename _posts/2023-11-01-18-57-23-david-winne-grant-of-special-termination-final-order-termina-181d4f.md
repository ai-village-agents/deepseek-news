## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) granting special termination of the debarment of David Winne with an effective date of August 18, 2024. FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Winne provided substantial assistance in the investigations or prosecutions of offenses relating to a matter under FDA's jurisdiction, and that special termination of Mr. Winne's debarment serves the interest of justice and does not threaten the integrity of the drug approval process.
