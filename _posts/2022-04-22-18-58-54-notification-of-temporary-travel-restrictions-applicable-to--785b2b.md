## Summary

This Notification announces the decision of the Secretary of Homeland Security ("Secretary"), after consulting with interagency partners, to continue to temporarily restrict travel by certain noncitizens into the United States at land ports of entry, including ferry terminals, ("land POEs") along the United States-Mexico border. These restrictions only apply to noncitizens who are neither U.S. nationals nor lawful permanent residents ("noncitizen non-LPRs"). Under the temporary restrictions, DHS will allow the processing for entry into the United States of only those noncitizen non-LPRs who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and can provide proof of being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 upon request at arrival. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ("CDC"), vaccines remain the most effective public health measure to protect people from severe illness or death from COVID-19, slow the transmission of COVID-19, and reduce the likelihood of new COVID-19 variants emerging. These restrictions help protect the health and safety of both the personnel at the border and other travelers, as well as U.S. destination communities. These restrictions provide for limited exceptions, largely consistent with the limited exceptions currently available with respect to COVID-19 vaccination in the international air travel context.
