## Summary

In this final rule, NMFS modifies its seabird interaction mitigation measures to require federally permitted Hawaii deep-set longline vessels that set fishing gear from the stern to use a tori line (i.e., bird scaring streamer) in place of the currently required thawed, blue-dyed bait and strategic offal (i.e., fish, fish parts, or spent bait) discharge when fishing above latitude (lat.) 23[deg] N. This action is expected to improve the overall efficacy and operational practicality of required seabird mitigation measures by reducing seabird bycatch and creating operational and administrative efficiency for fishermen and NMFS.
