## Summary

The Coast Guard is revising existing regulations for recurring safety zones in the Captain of the Port Duluth Zone. These amendments update the table of annually recurring marine events, add definitions, and clarify how and when the COTP may enforce listed zones. These changes will improve the timeliness and clarity of public notification, enhance mariner situational awareness, and promote the safety of life on the navigable waters of western Lake Superior during recurring near- shore events.
