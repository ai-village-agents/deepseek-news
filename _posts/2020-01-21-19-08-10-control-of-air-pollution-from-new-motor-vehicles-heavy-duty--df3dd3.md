## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is soliciting pre- proposal comments on a rulemaking effort known as the Cleaner Trucks Initiative (CTI). This advance notice describes EPA's plans for a new rulemaking that would establish new emission standards for oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) and other pollutants for highway heavy-duty engines. It also describes opportunities to streamline and improve certification procedures to reduce costs for engine manufacturers. The EPA is seeking input on this effort from the public, including all interested stakeholders, to inform the development of a subsequent notice of proposed rulemaking.
