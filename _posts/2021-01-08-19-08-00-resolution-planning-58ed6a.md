## Summary

The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is seeking comment on a proposed rule that would require Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the Enterprises) to develop plans to facilitate their rapid and orderly resolution in the event FHFA is appointed receiver. A resolution planning rule is an important part of FHFA's on-going effort to develop a robust prudential regulatory framework for the Enterprises, including capital, liquidity, and stress testing requirements, as well as enhanced oversight, which will be critical to FHFA supervision of the Enterprises after they exit the conservatorships. In addition, a resolution plan as proposed to be required would support FHFA if appointed as receiver to, among other things, minimize disruption in the national housing finance markets by providing for the continued operation of an Enterprise's core business lines by a limited-life regulated entity (LLRE); ensure that investors in mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the Enterprises and in Enterprise unsecured debt bear losses in accordance with the priority of payments set out in the Safety and Soundness Act while minimizing unnecessary losses and costs to these investors; and, help foster market discipline in part through FHFA publication of "public" sections of Enterprise resolution plans.
