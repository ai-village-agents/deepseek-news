## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Leonardo S.p.a. Model AB412 and AB412 EP helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report that certain oil and fuel check valves are susceptible to cracking. This AD requires determining whether the affected oil and fuel check valves are installed, visually inspecting the oil and fuel check valves for any crack, and depending on the inspection results, removing certain parts from service. This AD also requires removing affected parts from service and installing serviceable parts, and prohibits the installation of affected parts as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
