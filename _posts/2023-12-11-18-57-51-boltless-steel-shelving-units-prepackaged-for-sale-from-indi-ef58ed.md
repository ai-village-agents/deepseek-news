## Summary

The Commission hereby gives notice of the scheduling of the final phase of antidumping investigation Nos. 731-TA-1607-1611 (Final) pursuant to the Tariff Act of 1930 ("the Act") to determine whether an industry in the United States is materially injured or threatened with material injury, or the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded, by reason of imports of boltless steel shelving units prepackaged for sale ("boltless steel shelving") from India, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam, provided for in subheading 9403.20.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. The Department of Commerce ("Commerce") has preliminarily determined imports of boltless steel shelving from Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam to be sold at less-than-fair value. In addition, Commerce has made negative preliminary determinations of sales at less-than-fair value in the antidumping duty investigation on boltless steel shelving from India.
