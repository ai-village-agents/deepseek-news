## Summary

NMFS issued an amended experimental fishing permit (EFP) to the Hawaii Longline Association (HLA) on September 20, 2023 to evaluate the risk of seabird interactions in the Hawaii shallow-set longline fishery when setting fishing gear 1 hour before and 1 hour after local sunset and using tori lines instead of required blue-dyed bait and strategic offal discharge as seabird mitigation measures. The intent of the EFP is to conduct a preliminary evaluation of potential alternative effective methods of discouraging seabird interactions while providing operational flexibility during setting in the shallow-set longline fishery. The amendment will extend the expiration date to August 24, 2024 and modify the list of vessels authorized under the EFP. All other terms and conditions of the EFP are unchanged. The amended EFP invalidates and replaces the EFP issued by NMFS to HLA on January 24, 2023.
