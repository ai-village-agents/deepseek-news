## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) debarring Mark Godding for a period of 5 years from importing or offering for import any drug into the United States. FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Godding was convicted of one felony count under Federal law for Introducing or Delivering for Introduction a Misbranded Drug in Interstate Commerce. The factual basis supporting Mr. Godding's conviction, as described below, is conduct relating to the importation into the United States of a drug or controlled substance. Mr. Godding was given notice of the proposed debarment and was given an opportunity to request a hearing to show why he should not be debarred. As of September 29, 2022 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Mr. Godding had not responded. Mr. Godding's failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this matter.
