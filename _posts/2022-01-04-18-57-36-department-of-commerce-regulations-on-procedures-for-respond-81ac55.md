## Summary

This final rule revises the Department of Commerce's (Commerce) regulations, known as "Touhy regulations," that set forth the procedures for responding to requests for documents or testimony for use in legal proceedings. The revisions provide greater clarity to entities seeking documents or testimony from current or former Department employees. Specifically, these revisions clarify, update, and streamline the language of several provisions, provide greater transparency regarding the factors that the agency will consider when reviewing such requests, and more directly address issues that frequently arise in requests for documents or testimony based on the facts of the request, such as whether the testimony requested is that of a former employee, whether the United States is a party to the underlying legal proceedings, or whether the testimony or documents are requested from the Office of the Inspector General.
