## Summary

NMFS approves and implements final small-mesh multispecies specifications for the 2021 fishing year, and projected specifications for fishing years 2022 and 2023, as recommended by the New England Fishery Management Council. This action also increases the whiting possession limit for certain trips and restores the in-season adjustment trigger for northern red hake. This action is necessary to establish allowable harvest levels and other management measures consistent with the most recent scientific information. This rule informs the public of these final fishery specifications for the 2021 fishing year.
