## Summary

On January 30, 2020, the NCUA Board (Board) published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in the Federal Register. The NPRM requested comment on the Board's proposal to add subpart D to part 708a of its regulations and clarify the scope of section 741.8 of the NCUA's regulations related to procedures and requirements for combination transactions. The NPRM provided a 60-day comment period that closed on March 30, 2020. To allow stakeholders more time to consider and submit their comments, the Board has determined to reopen the comment period for an additional 60 days.
