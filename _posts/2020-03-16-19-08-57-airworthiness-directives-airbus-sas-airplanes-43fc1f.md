## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of incorrectly engaged lock washer tabs of the main landing gear (MLG) forward pintle bearing (FPB) at the forward face of the trunnion block. This AD requires detailed inspections of the left-hand (LH) and right-hand (RH) side MLG FPB nuts and lock washer tabs, and depending on findings, accomplishment of repetitive detailed inspections or corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
