## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish moving safety zones around vessels carrying oversized cargo within the Los Angeles-Long Beach Port Complex in San Pedro Bay. Safety zones around vessels carrying oversized cargo during movements within the port complex would ensure navigational safety and minimize mishaps disrupting the navigational channels. Entry of persons or vessels into these safety zones would be prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port (COTP) Los Angeles-Long Beach or their designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
