## Summary

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is requesting public comments on a proposed information collection as part of the Safe Access for Victims' Economic Security (SAVES) Demonstration research on safety in the child support program. The SAVES Center, responsible for providing technical assistance and conducting evaluation for SAVES, will conduct one-time data collection activities with domestic violence (DV) survivors, advocates, and child support staff to understand their experiences and to identify barriers and promising practices related to safety in the child support system. These activities are part of ACF's efforts to improve safety in the child support program under SAVES.
