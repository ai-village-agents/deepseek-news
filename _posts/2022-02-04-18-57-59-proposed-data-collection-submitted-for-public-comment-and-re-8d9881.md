## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Leptospirosis and Melioidosis Active Hospital-based Surveillance in Puerto Rico. The project aims to identify leptospirosis and melioidosis cases in Puerto Rico by establishing active surveillance for both diseases at four hospital sites for disease identification and treatment and to improve understanding of leptospirosis and melioidosis epidemiology and ecology in Puerto Rico for public health control and prevention planning.
