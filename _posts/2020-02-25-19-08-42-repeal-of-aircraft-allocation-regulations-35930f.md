## Summary

This final rule rescinds DOT regulations regarding aircraft allocation from the Code of Federal Regulations. The regulations prescribe procedures for the allocation of aircraft to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) program. The Department of Transportation (the Department or DOT) has concluded that the regulations are unnecessary and obsolete because they are inconsistent with the contractual nature of the current CRAF program and the Department's current procedures for allocation of civil transportation resources under the Defense Production Act.
