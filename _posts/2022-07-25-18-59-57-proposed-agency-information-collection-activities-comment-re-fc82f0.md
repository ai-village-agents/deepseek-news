## Summary

In accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), the OCC, the Board, and the FDIC (the agencies) may not conduct or sponsor, and the respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. On March 28, 2022, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), of which the agencies are members, requested public comment for 60 days on a proposal to extend for three years, without revision, the Market Risk Regulatory Report for Institutions Subject to the Market Risk Capital Rule (FFIEC 102), which is currently an approved collection of information for each agency. The comment period for the March 2022 notice expired on May 27, 2022. No comments were received and the agencies will proceed with the extension, without revision, of the FFIEC 102. In addition, the agencies are giving notice that they are sending the collections to OMB for review.
