## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-22- 05, which applied to all General Electric Company (GE) CF34-8C model turbofan engines. AD 2019-22-05 required initial and repetitive inspections of the operability bleed valve (OBV) fuel tubes, OBV bleed air manifold link rod assemblies, and the OBV fuel fittings. AD 2019- 22-05 also required replacement of OBVs or related OBV link rod hardware that fail inspection. This AD was prompted by multiple reports of fuel leaks, some leading to engine fires, which have occurred as a result of malfunctions related to the OBV. Additionally, the manufacturer has redesigned the OBV, which terminates the need for the repetitive inspections. This AD requires initial and repetitive inspections of the OBV fuel tubes, OBV bleed air manifold link rod assemblies, and the OBV fuel fittings installed on GE CF34-8C model turbofan engines. This AD requires replacement of OBVs or related OBV link rod hardware that fail inspection. As a terminating action to the repetitive inspections, this AD requires replacement of certain OBVs installed on GE CF34-8C model turbofan engines. This AD also requires replacement of certain OBVs installed on GE CF34-8E model turbofan engines. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
