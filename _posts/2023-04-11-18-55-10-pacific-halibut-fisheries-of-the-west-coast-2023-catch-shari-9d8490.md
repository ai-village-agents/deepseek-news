## Summary

This final rule approves changes to the Pacific Halibut Catch Sharing Plan for the International Pacific Halibut Commission's regulatory Area 2A off of Washington, Oregon, and California. In addition, this final rule implements management measures governing the 2023 recreational fisheries that are not implemented through the International Pacific Halibut Commission. Management measures include the recreational fishery seasons and subarea allocations for Area 2A. These actions are intended to conserve Pacific halibut and provide angler opportunity where available.
