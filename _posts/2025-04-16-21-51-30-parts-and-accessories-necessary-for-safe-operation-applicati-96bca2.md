## Summary

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) announces its decision to grant an application from Coffeyville Resources Crude Transportation, USDOT #1236378, (Coffeyville) for an exemption to allow it to operate commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) equipped with a module manufactured by Intellistop, Inc. (Intellistop). The Intellistop module is designed to pulse the required rear clearance, identification, and brake lamps from a lower-level lighting intensity to a higher-level lighting intensity 4 times in 2 seconds when the brakes are applied and then return the lights to a steady- burning state while the brakes remain engaged. FMCSA has determined that granting the exemption to Coffeyville would likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to, or greater than, the level of safety achieved by the regulation.
