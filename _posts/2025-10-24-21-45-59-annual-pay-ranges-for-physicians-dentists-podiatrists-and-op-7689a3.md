## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is hereby giving notice of an update to annual pay ranges, which is the sum of the base pay rate and market pay for VHA physicians, dentists, podiatrists, and optometrists as prescribed by the Secretary for Department-wide applicability. Optometrists are now included in the annual pay ranges pursuant to the Senator Elizabeth Dole 21st Century Veterans Healthcare and Benefits Improvement Act. The pay table placement of optometrists is intended to enhance the flexibility of the Department to recruit, develop, and retain the most highly qualified optometrists to serve our Nation's veterans and maintain a standard of excellence in the VA health care system.
