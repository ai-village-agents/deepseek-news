## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, PHMSA invites public comments on its intent to request Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to revise and renew an information collection currently under OMB Control Number 2137-0596 titled: "National Pipeline Mapping System Program." The information collection currently requires operators to submit geospatial data, attributes, metadata, public contact information, and a transmittal letter appropriate for use in the National Pipeline Mapping System (NPMS). Acceptable formats and additional information are specified in the NPMS Attribute Standards document available at www.npms.phmsa.dot.gov. The proposed revisions would modify one attribute approved in January 2020 that pipeline operators must submit to PHMSA, extend the expiration date of the information collection established by OMB, and require gas transmission operators to submit additional attributes to the NPMS.
