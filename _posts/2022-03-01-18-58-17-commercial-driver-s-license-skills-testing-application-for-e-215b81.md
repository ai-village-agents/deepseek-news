## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to grant the exemption request of the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA). AAMVA requested a multi-year exemption on behalf of the State Driver Licensing Agencies (SDLAs) in Maryland, New Hampshire, and Virginia to allow the three States to continue using revised Commercial Driver's License (CDL) pre-trip vehicle inspection and revised control skills test procedures following the completion of field tests conducted under a waiver granted by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). AAMVA believes that the requested exemption would enable these States to continue operating under the pilot model without the burden of reverting to the current CDL test model generating costs and delays associated with the re-configuration of testing locations and retraining of CDL test examiners. FMCSA has analyzed the exemption application and the public comments and has determined that the exemption, subject to the terms and conditions imposed, will achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent such exemption.
