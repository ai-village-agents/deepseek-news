## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will host an open discussion and listening session with nonprofit organizations across the country to hear about nonprofit leadership in brownfields assessment, cleanup, and redevelopment projects. This is a virtual event and will be held on Friday, April 23, 2021 through Zoom from 1 p.m.-3 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. EPA will make registration information available to the public on the agency's website at http:// www.epa.gov/brownfields on Friday, April 2, 2021. Due to the limit of 250 participants, attendance will be on a first-come, first served basis. Registration is required. After registering and prior to April 2, confirmed participants will receive an email from Eventbrite with a link to use to join the event. The purpose of this meeting is to hear from representatives of nonprofits, using the following questions to guide the discussion: How does your nonprofit organization view its role in brownfields cleanup and redevelopment? What benefits and barriers exist to nonprofits leading brownfield cleanup and redevelopment projects? How can EPA best engage with nonprofit organizations that are most interested in leading brownfields cleanup and redevelopment? In addition to the open discussion and listening session, stakeholders may respond in writing to the guiding questions mentioned above during a three-week comment period that will commence upon publication of this notice. Comments will be accepted through April 23, 2021 and should be submitted through email to EPA's Office of Brownfields and Land Revitalization at BUILDAct@epa.gov.
