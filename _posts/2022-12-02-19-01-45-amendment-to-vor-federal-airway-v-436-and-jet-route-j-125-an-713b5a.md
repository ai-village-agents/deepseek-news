## Summary

This action corrects a final rule published by the FAA in the Federal Register on November 1, 2022, that amends Alaskan VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airway V-436 and Jet Route J-125, and establishes United States Area Navigation (RNAV) route T-399 in the vicinity of Clear, AK. In the final rule, the amendments to V-436 addressed in the preamble were incomplete and did not address all of the airway segment amendments being made. Additionally, the final rule referenced the AILEE, AK, route point as a waypoint (WP), in error, in the V-436 and T-399 amendment discussions in the preamble and in the T- 399 route description in the regulatory text. The correct characterization of the AILEE, AK, route point is as a Fix. This action corrects the oversight of not including all of the V-436 amendments addressed in the preamble to match the V-436 description in the regulatory text and changes all references of the AILEE, AK, WP to the AILEE, AK, Fix to match the FAA's National Airspace System Resource (NASR) database information.
