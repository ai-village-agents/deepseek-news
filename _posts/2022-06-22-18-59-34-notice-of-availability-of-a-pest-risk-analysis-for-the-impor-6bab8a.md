Based on the analysis, we have determined that the application of one or more designated phytosanitary measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks of introducing or disseminating plant pests or noxious weeds via the importation of fresh baby kiwi fruit from France. We are making the pest risk analysis available to the public for review and comment.
