## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all MHI RJ Aviation ULC Model CL-600-2C10 (Regional Jet Series 700, 701 & 702) airplanes, Model CL-600-2C11 (Regional Jet Series 550) airplanes, Model CL-600-2D15 (Regional Jet Series 705) airplanes, Model CL-600- 2D24 (Regional Jet Series 900) airplanes, and Model CL-600-2E25 (Regional Jet Series 1000) airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that new and more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate two aircraft maintenance manual (AMM) tasks. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
