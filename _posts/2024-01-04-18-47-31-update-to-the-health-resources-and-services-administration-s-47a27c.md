## Summary

A Federal Register notice published on September 29, 2023, detailed and sought public comment on recommendations under development by the Women's Preventive Services Initiative (WPSI), regarding updates to the HRSA-supported Women's Preventive Services Guidelines (Guidelines). The proposed updates specifically related to Screening for Urinary Incontinence. WPSI convenes health professionals to develop draft recommendations for HRSA's consideration. Two public comments were received and considered as detailed below. On December 28, 2023, HRSA accepted as final WPSI's recommended updates to the Screening for Urinary Incontinence guideline. Under applicable law, non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance issuers offering non- grandfathered group and individual health insurance coverage must include coverage, without cost sharing, for certain preventive services, including those provided for in the HRSA-supported Guidelines. The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and the Treasury have previously issued regulations describing how group health plans and health insurance issuers apply the coverage requirements.
