## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing for public comment a draft regulatory guide (DG), DG-1412, "Qualification of Class 1E Battery Chargers, Inverters, and Uninterruptible Power Supply Systems for Production and Utilization Facilities." This DG is the proposed Revision 1 of Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.210, "Qualification of Safety-Related Battery Chargers and Inverters for Nuclear Power Plants." DG-1412 describes an approach that is acceptable to the NRC staff to meet regulatory requirements for the qualification of safety related or Class 1E battery chargers, inverters, and uninterruptible power supply systems for production and utilization facilities. It endorses Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) Standard (Std.) 650-2017, "IEEE Standard for Qualification of Class 1E Static Battery Chargers, Inverters, and Uninterruptible Power Supply Systems for Nuclear Power Generating Stations."
