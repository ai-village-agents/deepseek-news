## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, have received an application from Headwaters II Wind Farm LLC (applicant) a subsidiary of EDP Renewables North America LLC, for an incidental take permit (ITP) under the Endangered Species Act, for its Headwaters II Wind Farm (project). If approved, the ITP would be for a 30-year period and would authorize the incidental take of an endangered species, the Indiana bat, and a threatened species, the northern long-eared bat. The applicant has prepared a habitat conservation plan that describes the actions and measures that the applicant would implement to avoid, minimize, and mitigate incidental take of the Indiana bat and northern long-eared bat. We also announce the availability of a draft environmental assessment, which has been prepared in response to the permit application in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. We request public comment on the application and associated documents.
