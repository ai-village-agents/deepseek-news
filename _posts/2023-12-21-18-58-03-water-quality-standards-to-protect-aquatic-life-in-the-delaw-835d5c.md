## Summary

On December 1, 2022, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determined that revised water quality standards are necessary to protect aquatic life in certain water quality management zones of the Delaware River. Specifically, the EPA issued an Administrator's Determination, pursuant to the Clean Water Act (CWA), finding that a revised designated use to protect aquatic life propagation and corresponding dissolved oxygen criteria to protect that use are necessary in Zone 3, Zone 4, and the upper portion of Zone 5 (in total, river miles 108.4 to 70.0) of the Delaware River. The CWA requires the EPA to publish proposed water quality standards following an Administrator's Determination. Thus, the EPA is proposing to promulgate an aquatic life designated use that includes propagation and protective water quality criteria for dissolved oxygen for Zone 3, Zone 4, and upper Zone 5 of the Delaware River.
