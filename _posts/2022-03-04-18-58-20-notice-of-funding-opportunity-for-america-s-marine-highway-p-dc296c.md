## Summary

This notice announces the availability of funding for grants and establishes selection criteria and application requirements for the America's Marine Highway Program ("AMHP"). The purpose of this program is to make grants available to previously designated Marine Highway Projects that support the development and expansion of documented vessels or port and landside infrastructure. The U.S. Department of Transportation ("DOT" or "Department") also seeks eligible grant projects that will strengthen American supply chains. The Department will award Marine Highway Grants to implement projects or components of projects previously designated by the Secretary of Transportation ("Secretary") under the AMHP. Only Marine Highway Projects the Secretary designates before the Notice of Funding Opportunity ("NOFO") closing date are eligible for funding as described in this notice.
