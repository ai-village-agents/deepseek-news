## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved revisions to California's federally authorized hazardous waste program by publishing proposed and final rules in the Federal Register on October 18, 2019 and January 14, 2020, respectively. The notice for the proposed rule inadvertently and unintentionally left out citations for approving the State's authority to adopt additional waste streams as universal wastes in the State Analogues to the Federal Program table. In addition, the scope of the State program that is considered "broader in scope" than the federal program was mis-designated. We are proposing to correct these and related errors. EPA seeks public comment prior to taking final action.
