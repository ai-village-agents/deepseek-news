## Summary

We are advising the public that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has prepared a draft plant pest risk assessment and draft environmental assessment regarding a request from Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc., seeking a determination of nonregulated status for DP23211 maize (corn), which was developed using genetic engineering for insect resistance to western corn rootworm and contains the gene that codes for the phosphinothricin acetyltransferase protein responsible for tolerance to glufosinate-ammonium herbicides. DP23211 corn also contains the gene that encodes for the phosphomannose isomerase protein, which is used as a selectable marker. We are making these documents available for public review and comment.
