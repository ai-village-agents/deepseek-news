## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) hereby announces its final cancellation order for the cancellations and amendments to terminate uses voluntarily requested by the registrants and accepted by the Agency, of the products in Table 1 and Table 2 of Unit II, pursuant to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). This final cancellation order follows a May 3, 2023, Federal Register Notice of Receipt of Requests from the registrants listed in Table 3 of Unit II, to voluntarily cancel or amend these product registrations. In the May 3, 2023, notice, EPA indicated that it would issue a final order implementing the cancellations and amendments, unless the Agency received substantive comments within the 30-day comment period that would merit further review of these requests, or unless the registrants withdrew their requests. The Agency received two comments on the notice, which are summarized in Unit III.B. EPA's responses to these comments and its determination that these comments do not merit further review of these cancellation and amendment requests are included in Unit III.C. None of the registrants withdrew their request for these voluntary cancellations or amendments. Accordingly, EPA hereby grants the requested cancellations and amendments to terminate uses as shown in this cancellation order. Any distribution, sale, or use of existing stocks of these products subject to this cancellation order is permitted only in accordance with the terms of this order.
