## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-23-05, which applies to certain Airbus Helicopters Model EC225LP helicopters. AD 2020-23-05 requires inspecting the control rod attachment yokes (yokes) of certain main rotor (M/R) rotating swashplates (swashplates), establishing a life limit, a one-time inspection of stripped yokes, and applicable corrective actions. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-23-05, the FAA has determined that a revised compliance time is necessary for swashplates that have accumulated less than seven years since the date of manufacture and that clarification is necessary for the condition that concludes with a dye penetrant inspection of the yoke. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2020-23-05, with a revised compliance time for a certain inspection. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
