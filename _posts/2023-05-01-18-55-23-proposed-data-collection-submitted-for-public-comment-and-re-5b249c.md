## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant. CDC will use the Block Grant Information System to collect recipient data, monitor awardees' progress, identify activities and personnel supported with Block Grant funding, conduct compliance reviews of Block Grant recipients, and promote the use of evidence-based guidelines and interventions in accordance with legislative mandates.
