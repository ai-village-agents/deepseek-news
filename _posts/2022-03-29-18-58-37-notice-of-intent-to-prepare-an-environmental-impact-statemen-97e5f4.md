## Summary

The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Utah State Office announces its intent to prepare an EIS for the Cove-East Fork Virgin River Watershed Plan EIS Project located within the East Fork Virgin River Watershed in Kane County, Utah. The EIS process will examine alternative solutions to provide adequate irrigation water in Kane and Washington counties during summer months, local water-based recreation, and green energy opportunities. This EIS will also serve as the necessary environmental documentation for development of a new Black Knoll borrow pit and potential expansion of the existing Bald Knoll borrow pit. Both pits are located on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administered public lands and require BLM authorization. The BLM will be a cooperating agency in the development of this EIS. NRCS is requesting comments to identify significant issues, potential alternatives, information, and analyses relevant to the Proposed Action from all interested individuals, Federal and State agencies, and Tribes.
