## Summary

HRSA's HIV/AIDS Bureau will award $100,000 in supplemental funding to the University of Washington. This award is to support the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program Part F AIDS Education and Training Centers (AETC) Enhancement and Update of the National HIV Curriculum e-Learning Platform project in Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 and in each succeeding year of their periods of performance, pending the availability of funds. This supplemental funding will enable the University of Washington to make critical content enhancements to the National HIV Curriculum e- Learning Platform that respond to the specific training and technical assistance needs of HIV treatment professionals located in the jurisdictions targeted by the Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America (EHE) initiative. Further, it will ensure that more health professionals in EHE jurisdictions have access to the most up-to-date HIV treatment interventions and protocols, thus increasing their competency to provide high-quality care for people with HIV and in so doing, advance the goals of the EHE.
