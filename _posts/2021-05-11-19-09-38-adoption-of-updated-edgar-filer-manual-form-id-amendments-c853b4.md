## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") is adopting amendments to Volumes I and II of the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system ("EDGAR") Filer Manual ("EDGAR Filer Manual" or "Filer Manual"), a related form, and related rules. The amendments result in a more uniform and secure process for EDGAR access by requiring certain applicants that already have an EDGAR Central Index Key (or CIK) account number, but do not have EDGAR access codes, to submit the related form and an authenticating document to obtain access to EDGAR. The related form has also been amended to update its instructions and cross-references to Volume I of the Filer Manual. The revisions to Volume II reflect additional updates to the EDGAR system.
