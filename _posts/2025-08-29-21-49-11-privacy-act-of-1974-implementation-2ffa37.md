This system of records has been exempted from the access and amendment provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, U.S.C. 552a(d), pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1), and (k)(2). See 28 CFR 16.83.

For the reasons provided below, the Department proposes to update its Privacy Act regulations exempting records in this system from certain provisions of the Privacy Act. Public comment is invited.
