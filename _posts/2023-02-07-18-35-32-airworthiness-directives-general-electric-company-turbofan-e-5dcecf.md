## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all General Electric Company (GE) CF34-8C1, CF34-8C5, CF34-8C5A1, CF34- 8C5B1, CF34-8C5A2, CF34-8C5A3, CF34-8E2, CF34-8E2A1, CF34-8E5, CF34- 8E5A1, CF34-8E5A2, CF34-8E6, and CF34-8E6A1 model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by a predicted reduction in the cyclic life of the combustion chamber assembly aft flange. This AD requires revisions to the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the existing engine manual (EM) and the operator's existing approved maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate initial and repetitive fluorescent penetrant inspections (FPIs) of the combustion chamber assembly. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
