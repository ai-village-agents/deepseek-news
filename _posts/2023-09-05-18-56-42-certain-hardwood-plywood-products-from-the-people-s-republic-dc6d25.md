## Summary

On August 22, 2023, the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) issued its final judgment in Far East American, Inc., et al., v. United States, Consol. Court no. 22-00049 (Far Eastern), sustaining the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce)'s first remand results of redetermination pertaining to the final scope ruling for the antidumping and countervailing duty orders on certain hardwood plywood products (hardwood plywood) from the People's Republic of China (China). In the underlying ruling, Commerce determined that hardwood plywood exported into the United States by Vietnam Finewood Company Limited (Finewood) that was produced using two-ply panels imported into Vietnam from China was included in the scope of the orders. Commerce is notifying the public that the CIT's final judgment is not in harmony with Commerce's final scope ruling on Finewood's two-ply panels from China and is amending its final scope ruling.
