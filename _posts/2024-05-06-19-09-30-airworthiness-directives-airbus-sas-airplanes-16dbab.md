# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus SAS Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A330-243, -302, -343, and -941 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that a certain aft bulkhead cover panel may have been made with a non-conforming material. This proposed AD would require replacing the aft bulkhead cover panel and prohibit the installation of affected parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
