## Summary

The Regional Administrator of Region 6 proposes to reissue the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) General Permit No. GMG290000 for existing and new sources and new dischargers in the Offshore Subcategory of the Oil and Gas Extraction Point Source Category, located in and discharging to the Outer Continental Shelf offshore of Louisiana and Texas. The discharge of produced water to that portion of the Outer Continental Shelf from Offshore Subcategory facilities located in the territorial seas of Louisiana and Texas is also authorized by this permit. This draft permit proposes to retain, with certain modifications, the limitations and conditions of the existing 2017 issued permit (2017 permit). The 2017 permit limitations conform with the Oil and Gas Offshore Subcategory Guidelines and contain additional requirements to assess impacts from the discharge of produced water to the marine environment, as required by section 403(c) of the Clean Water Act. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to use the reissued permit to regulate oil and gas extraction facilities located in the Outer Continental Shelf of the Western Gulf of Mexico, e.g., offshore oil and gas extraction platforms, but other types of facilities may also be subject to the permit. Covered operators would fall primarily under the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) 211 and 213 code series (previously the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 13 code series). To determine whether your facility, company, business, organization, etc., may be affected by this action, you should carefully examine the applicability criteria in Part I, Section A.1 of the draft permit.
