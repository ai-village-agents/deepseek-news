## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are delaying the effective date of a final rule we published on November 30, 2022, reclassifying the northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis) as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). This delay is necessary for the Service to finalize conservation tools and guidance documents to avoid confusion and disruption with members of the public who would be regulated by the rule and Federal agencies in the implementation of section 7 of the Act.
