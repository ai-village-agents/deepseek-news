## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), withdraw the proposed rule to list the Chapin Mesa milkvetch (Astragalus schmolliae) as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). We concurrently withdraw the proposed rule to designate critical habitat for the species. This withdrawal is based on our conclusion that the conservation plan for Chapin Mesa milkvetch at Mesa Verde National Park, and its associated implementation plan, in addition to new standard operating procedures for fire management at Mesa Verde National Park, reduce the threats to the species such that it no longer meets the Act's definition of an "endangered species" or a "threatened species." Therefore, we are withdrawing our proposal to list the Chapin Mesa milkvetch as a threatened species and our proposal to designate critical habitat for the species.
