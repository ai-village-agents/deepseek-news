## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede airworthiness directive (AD) 2018-08-02 which applies to all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Trent 1000-A2, Trent 1000-AE2, Trent 1000-C2, Trent 1000-CE2, Trent 1000-D2, Trent 1000-E2, Trent 1000-G2, Trent 1000-H2, Trent 1000- J2, Trent 1000-K2, and Trent 1000-L2 model turbofan engines. AD 2018- 08-02 requires initial and repetitive ultrasonic or visual inspections of the intermediate-pressure compressor (IPC) stage 1 rotor blades, IPC stage 2 rotor blades, and IPC shaft stage 2 dovetail posts, and removal of any cracked parts from service. Since the FAA issued AD 2018-08-02, the manufacturer identified cracking of parts in-service resulting in the need to require new inspections using new inspection thresholds and intervals. This proposed AD would require new inspections based on updated inspection thresholds and intervals for these IPC parts. This AD would also add an optional terminating action, amend the asymmetric power condition for engine inspection, and require an inspection after a cabin depressurization event. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
