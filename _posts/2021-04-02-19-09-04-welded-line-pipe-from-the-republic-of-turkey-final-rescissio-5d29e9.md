## Summary

The Department of Commerce (Commerce) determines that Cimtas Boru Imalatlari ve Ticaret, Ltd. Sti. (Cimtas), the sole mandatory respondent and only company with suspended entries of subject merchandise during the period of review (POR), did not have reviewable sales during the POR, December 1, 2018, through November 30, 2019. We are deferring, in part, Cimtas' sales reporting until a subsequent review period. Additionally, Commerce is rescinding, in part, this administrative review with respect to the remaining 18 companies for which we initiated a review because they have no reviewable, suspended entries of subject merchandise during the POR.
