## Summary

The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act established the Surface Transportation Project Delivery Program (referred to as National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Assignment Program), allows a State to assume FHWA's environmental responsibilities for environmental review, consultation, and compliance under NEPA. When a State assumes these Federal responsibilities, the State becomes solely responsible and liable for carrying out the responsibilities it has assumed, in lieu of FHWA. This program mandates annual audits during each of the first 4 years of State participation to ensure compliance with program requirements. This is the third audit of the Arizona Department of Transportation's (ADOT) performance of its responsibilities under the NEPA Assignment Program. This notice announces and solicits comments on the third audit report for ADOT.
