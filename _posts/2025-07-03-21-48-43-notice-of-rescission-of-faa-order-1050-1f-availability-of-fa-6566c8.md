## Summary

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is rescinding FAA Order 1050.1F, Environmental Impacts: Policies and Procedures in light of Executive Order 14154, Unleashing American Energy. The FAA is issuing new streamlined National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) procedures, FAA NEPA Order 1050.1G, to align with amendments to the NEPA, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., and to reflect the February 25, 2025 Interim Final Rule issued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) rescinding its regulations implementing NEPA. The new procedures maintain environmental amenities and protection and reduce regulatory delays that may impede aviation safety improvements and infrastructure development as well as integration of new entrant technologies. The Order is immediately effective upon publication and applies to all FAA actions that require environmental review and commence on or after the publication of this Notice. This Order does not apply to or alter any decisions made or final environmental documents issued prior to the effective date of this Order. Order 1050.1G promotes collaboration and efficiencies in the implementation of NEPA and modernizes the procedures for environmental reviews. This update is intended to provide clear, consistent, and simplified guidance for complying with the amended directives set forth in NEPA, and to the extent applicable, CEQ guidance that remains valid following the rescission of CEQ's NEPA implementing regulations. The FAA is providing an opportunity for public review and comment of this Order, which will inform future revisions.
