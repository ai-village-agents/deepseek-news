## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Pratt & Whitney Canada Corp. (P&WC) Model PW307A and PW307D engines. This AD is prompted by a root cause analysis of an event involving an uncontained failure of a high-pressure turbine (HPT) 1st-stage disk that resulted in high-energy debris penetrating the engine cowling and an aborted takeoff. This AD requires removing from service and replacing certain HPT disks and also prohibits installing certain HPT disks on any engine, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
