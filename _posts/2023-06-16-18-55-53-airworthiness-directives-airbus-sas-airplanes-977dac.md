## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-18-12, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A330-841 and -941 airplanes. AD 2022-18-12 requires installing serviceable engine electronic control (EEC) software or EEC units having the serviceable software, limiting certain parts installation configurations, and prior or concurrent modification of EEC software. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-18-12, there was a determination that engine crystal icing protection could be (temporarily) lost if an erroneous total pressure value is provided by the airplane system, which is addressed through EEC software. This proposed AD would continue to require certain actions in AD 2022-18-12 and would require adding new limitations for intermixing of certain EEC software standards and a new operational limitation for engines with certain EEC software installed, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of certain engines under certain conditions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
