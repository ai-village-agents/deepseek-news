## Summary

This proposed rule would update HUD's regulations that require participating agencies to provide in-person counseling to clients that prefer this format to reflect advances in technology, align with client engagement preferences, and preserve consumer protections. The proposed rule would amend HUD's regulations to allow housing counseling agencies to use alternative communication methods, including virtual meeting tools, in lieu of providing in-person services. Participating agencies that choose not to provide in-person services would be required to refer clients to local providers that provide such services, when requested.
