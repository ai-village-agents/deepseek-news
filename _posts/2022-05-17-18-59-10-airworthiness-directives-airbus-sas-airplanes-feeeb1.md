## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report indicating that on the A350 final assembly line (FAL), certain load sensing drive struts (LSDS) and drive struts (DS) were found not adjusted (the nut was not torqued) and not locked. Investigation revealed that the LSDS and DS had been changed as re-work action due to pre-installation damage, but production operations (adjustment and locking) were not done afterwards. This AD requires, for certain airplanes, inspection of the LSDS for correct adjustment and locking, and replacement if necessary, and, for certain other airplanes, replacement of each affected DS with a serviceable part, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
