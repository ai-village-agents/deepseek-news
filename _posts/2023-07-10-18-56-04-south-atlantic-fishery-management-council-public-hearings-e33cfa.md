## Summary

The South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council) will hold three webinar public hearings pertaining to the Comprehensive Amendment Addressing Electronic Reporting for Commercial Vessels. The amendment is being developed jointly with the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council to modify reporting for commercial fishing vessels issued South Atlantic or Gulf of Mexico permits and currently reporting through the Southeast Coastal Logbook program (Gulf Reef Fish, South Atlantic Snapper Grouper, Atlantic Dolphin and Wahoo, and Coastal Migratory Pelagic Resources of the Gulf and Atlantic), to require that the reports be submitted electronically. It is anticipated that this change will improve the timeliness and efficiency of the commercial logbook data collection and management program, which will improve monitoring and compliance of federally permitted commercial vessels participating in the Southeast Coastal Logbook program.
