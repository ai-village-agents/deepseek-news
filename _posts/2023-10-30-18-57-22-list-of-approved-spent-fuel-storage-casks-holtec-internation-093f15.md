## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its spent fuel storage regulations by revising the Holtec International HI- STORM 100 Cask System listing within the "List of approved spent fuel storage casks" to include Renewed Amendment No. 17 to Certificate of Compliance No. 1014. Because this amendment is subsequent to the renewal of the HI-STORM 100 Cask System Certificate of Compliance No. 1014 and, therefore, subject to the Aging Management Program requirements of the renewed certificate, NRC is referring to it as "Renewed Amendment No. 17." Renewed Amendment No. 17 updates the HI- STORM 100 Cask System description in the certificate of compliance to indicate that only the portions of the components that contact the pool water need to be made of stainless steel or aluminum. This amendment also includes minor editorial and formatting changes to the technical specifications that do not change the substantive technical information of the certificate of compliance.
