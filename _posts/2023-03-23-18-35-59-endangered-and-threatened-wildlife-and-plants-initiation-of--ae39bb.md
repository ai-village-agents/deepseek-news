## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, are initiating 5-year status reviews for 133 species in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, California, Nevada, Hawaii, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Two of these species also occur outside of United States jurisdiction in Canada and Palau. A 5-year status review is based on the best scientific and commercial data available at the time of the review; therefore, we are requesting submission of any new information on these species that has become available since the last reviews.
