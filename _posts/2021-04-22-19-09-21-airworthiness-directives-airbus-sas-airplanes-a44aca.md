## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-12-13, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A320-212, -214, - 232, and -233 airplanes. AD 2017-12-13 requires repetitive low frequency eddy current inspections or repetitive high frequency eddy current inspections of the pocket radius at certain areas of the fuselage frame, and repair if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2017- 12-13, it was determined that cracks can initiate and develop between certain other fuselage frames of the pocket radii and additional airplanes are subject to the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would require new repetitive inspections at the left- (LH) and right-hand (RH) sides of the fuselage skin at certain frames for any cracking, and repair if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
