## Summary

The FAA is correcting an airworthiness directive (AD) that was published in the Federal Register. That AD applies to all MHI RJ Aviation ULC Model CL-600-2C10 (Regional Jet Series 700, 701 & 702) airplanes, Model CL-600-2C11 (Regional Jet Series 550) airplanes, Model CL-600-2D15 (Regional Jet Series 705) airplanes, Model CL-600-2D24 (Regional Jet Series 900) airplanes, and Model C-600-2E25 (Regional Jet Series 1000) airplanes. As published, a portion of the initial compliance time for doing the new ram-air valve task specified in the regulatory text for certain airplanes is incorrect. This document corrects that error. In all other respects, the original document remains the same.
