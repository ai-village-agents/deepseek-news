## Summary

The Department of Energy (DOE) is rescinding the Policy Statement on Export Commencement Deadlines in Authorizations to Export Natural Gas to Non-Free Trade Agreement Countries issued on April 26, 2023 (Policy Statement). Henceforth, DOE will consider applications to extend an authorization holder's export commencement deadline and grant such extensions for good cause shown on a case-by-case basis, an approach consistent with DOE's practice prior to the issuance of the Policy Statement.
