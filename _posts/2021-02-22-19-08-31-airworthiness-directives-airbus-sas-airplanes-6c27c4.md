## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-09-14, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and - 1041 airplanes. AD 2020-09-14 requires revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to define a liquid-prohibited zone on the flight deck and provide procedures following liquid spillage on the center pedestal. AD 2020-09-14 also requires installing a removable integrated control panel (ICP) cover on the flight deck and further revising the AFM to include instructions for ICP cover use. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-09-14, a new, water-resistant ICP has been developed. This proposed AD would require installing a new, water-resistant ICP, which would allow removing the ICP protective cover and the AFM revisions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which will be incorporated by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
