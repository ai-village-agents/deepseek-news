## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency) is proposing to reclassify certain human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serological diagnostic and supplemental tests and HIV nucleic acid (NAT) diagnostic and supplemental tests, postamendments class III devices with the product code MZF, into class II (special controls), subject to premarket notification. FDA is also proposing new device classification regulations along with special controls that the Agency believes are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for these devices. FDA is proposing this reclassification on its own initiative. If finalized, this order will reclassify these types of devices from class III (premarket approval) to class II (special controls) and reduce the regulatory burdens associated with these devices, as these types of devices will no longer be required to submit a premarket approval application (PMA) but can instead submit a premarket notification (510(k)) and receive clearance before marketing their device.
