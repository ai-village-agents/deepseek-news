## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is issuing this notice to request that public stakeholders--including patient and consumer advocacy groups, healthcare professionals, and scientific and academic experts--notify FDA of their intent to participate in periodic consultation meetings on the reauthorization of the Medical Device User Fee Amendments (MDUFA). The statutory authority for MDUFA expires in September 2022. At that time, new legislation will be required for FDA to continue collecting user fees for the medical device program. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) requires that FDA consult with a range of stakeholders in developing recommendations for the next MDUFA program. The FD&C Act also requires that FDA hold discussions (at least every month) with patient and consumer advocacy groups during FDA's negotiations with the regulated industry. The purpose of this request for notification is to ensure continuity and progress in these monthly discussions by establishing consistent public stakeholder representation.
