## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Dassault Aviation Model FALCON 7X airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of smoke in the flightdeck and loss of the right- hand (RH) primary display unit (PDU) and the secondary flight display (SFD). This AD requires inspecting the two electrical power feeders for damage (deterioration), measuring the clearance between the two electrical power feeders and the forward lavatory bulkhead, and applicable corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
