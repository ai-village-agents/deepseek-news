## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is extending the comment period for the color additive petition for which we published a notice of filing in the Federal Register of February 17, 2023. In the notice, FDA requested comments on a filed color additive petition submitted by Center for Science in the Public Interest, et al., proposing that FDA repeal the color additive regulations providing for the use of FD&C Red No. 3 in foods (including dietary supplements) and in ingested drugs. We are taking this action in response to a request for an extension to allow interested persons additional time to submit comments.
