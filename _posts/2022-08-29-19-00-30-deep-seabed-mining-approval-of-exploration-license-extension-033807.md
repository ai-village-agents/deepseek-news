## Summary

NOAA is announcing the approval of a five-year extension request for two deep seabed hard mineral exploration licenses issued under the Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act (DSHMRA). The decision to approve the extensions follows a review of the request and activities performed by the Licensee pursuant to the exploration plan for the licenses, the proposed exploration plan, comments submitted on the request, and a determination that the Licensee has substantially complied with the licenses, their terms, conditions and restrictions, and the associated exploration plan. No at-sea exploration activities are authorized by these extensions without prior written authorization and further environmental review by NOAA.
