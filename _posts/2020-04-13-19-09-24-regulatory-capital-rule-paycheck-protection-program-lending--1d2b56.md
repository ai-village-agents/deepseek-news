## Summary

To provide liquidity to small business lenders and the broader credit markets, to help stabilize the financial system, and to provide economic relief to small businesses nationwide, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) authorized each of the Federal Reserve Banks to participate in the Paycheck Protection Program Lending Facility (PPPL Facility), pursuant to section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. Under the PPPL Facility, each of the Federal Reserve Banks will extend non-recourse loans to eligible financial institutions to fund loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration under the Paycheck Protection Program established by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). To facilitate use of this Federal Reserve facility, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (together, the agencies) are adopting this interim final rule to allow banking organizations to neutralize the regulatory capital effects of participating in the facility. This treatment is similar to the treatment extended previously by the agencies in connection with the Federal Reserve's Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility. In addition, as mandated by section 1102 of the CARES Act, loans originated under the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program will receive a zero percent risk weight under the agencies' regulatory capital rule.
