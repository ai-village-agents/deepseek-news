## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the Missouri State Implementation Plan (SIP) received on February 15, 2019. The submission revises Missouri's regulation that restricts the emissions of volatile organic compounds from wood furniture manufacturing operations in St. Louis City and Jefferson, St. Charles, Franklin, and St. Louis Counties. Specifically, the revisions to the proposed rule specify that this proposed rule only applies to sources that were existing at the time of the rule's promulgation, remove the unnecessary use of restrictive words, update references, and make minor clarifications and grammatical changes. These revisions do not have an adverse effect on air quality. The EPA's proposed approval of this proposed rule revision is being done in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA). Approval of these revisions will ensure consistency between state and federally- approved rules.
