## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") amends the test procedures for commercial refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers ("CRE") to reference the latest versions of the applicable industry standards. DOE also establishes definitions and test procedures for new equipment categories, adopts test procedures consistent with recently published waivers and interim waivers, establishes product-specific enforcement provisions, allows for volume determinations based on computer-aided designs, specifies a sampling plan for volume and total display area, and adopts additional clarifying amendments.
