## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, have received three separate applications for incidental take permits (ITPs) under the Endangered Species Act from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR), Minnesota DNR, and Wisconsin DNR. If approved, the permits would authorize incidental take of the Indiana bat, northern long-eared bat, little brown bat, and tricolored bat. The applicants also have jointly submitted the Lake States Forest Management Bat Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP). We make available for public comment the applicants' HCP and announce the availability of a draft environmental assessment, which has been prepared in response to the permit applications in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. We invite the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies to comment on these documents.
