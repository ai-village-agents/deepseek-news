## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace at Mineral Wells, TX. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of airspace reviews conducted as part of the decommissioning of the Mineral Wells non directional beacon (NDB). This action would also update the geographic coordinates of the airport and the Millsap Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VORTAC). The name of the airport would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database. This action will bring the airspace into compliance with FAA orders and support instrument flight rule (IFR) operations.
