## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Connecticut. This revision updates state regulations containing ambient air quality standards (AAQS) for ozone to be consistent with EPA's national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). In addition, this update clarifies the volatile organic compound (VOC) calculation methods for adhesive and sealant products. The intended effect of this action is to propose approval of these regulations into the Connecticut SIP. This action is being taken under the Clean Air Act.
