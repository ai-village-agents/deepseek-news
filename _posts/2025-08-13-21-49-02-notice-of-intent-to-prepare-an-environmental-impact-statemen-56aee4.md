## Summary

The Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) Missouri State Office announces its intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the St. Johns Watershed plan, located within the Lower North Cut Ditch, Sikeston Ridge--St. Johns Ditch, Maple Slough Ditch, Ash Ditch--St. Johns Ditch, and St. Johns Ditch--St. Johns Bayou Watershed in Mississippi, New Madrid, and Scott Counties, Missouri. The project area involves the St. Johns Bayou and St. James Ditches and adjacent lands on the west landward side of the setback levee to the watershed outlet at Mississippi River floodgates near New Madrid, Missouri. Closure of the Mississippi River floodgates prevents flood damage from the river at flood stage; however, when closed, it blocks the outlet of the watershed and causes flooding from impounded interior runoff. Residences, agricultural land, and developed land are impacted. NRCS is requesting that interested individuals, Federal and State agencies, and Tribes participate in the scoping process for the EIS by attending the initial public scoping meeting and by submitting comments as described below. The goal of scoping is for NRCS to obtain input on identifying significant issues, potential alternatives, information, and analyses relevant to the proposed action.
