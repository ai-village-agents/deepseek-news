## Summary

The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) is waiving the Build America, Buy America (BABA) Act's domestic preference requirements for certain products that Philadelphia Gas Works (PGW) needs for its Natural Gas Distribution Infrastructure Safety and Modernization (NGDISM) grant project due to lack of availability, unreasonable cost, or public good. The waiver would exempt the following products used in PGW's project from BABA requirements on the basis of nonavailability: electro-fusion tapping tees, anodeless risers, transition fittings, lockwing valves, magnesium anodes, service adapters, curb valves, caps, couplings, and stiffeners.
