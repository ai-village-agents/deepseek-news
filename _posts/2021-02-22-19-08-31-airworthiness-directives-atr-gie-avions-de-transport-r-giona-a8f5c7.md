## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain ATR-GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR72- 212A airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of an engine electrical control #1 fault during flight caused by chafing damage on an electrical harness bundle. This proposed AD would require modifying the electrical harness routes and de-icing pipe coupling installations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
