## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA or Agency) is amending various regulations governing SBA's 7(a) Loan Program and 504 Loan Program, including regulations on use of proceeds for partial changes of ownership, lending criteria, loan conditions, reconsiderations, and affiliation standards, to expand access to capital to small businesses and drive economic recovery. The amendments to affiliation standards will also apply to the Microloan Program, Intermediary Lending Pilot Program, Surety Bond Guarantee Program, and the Disaster Loan programs (except for the COVID Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) Disaster Loan Program).
