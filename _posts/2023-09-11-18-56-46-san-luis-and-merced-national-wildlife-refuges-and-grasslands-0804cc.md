## Summary

We, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce the availability of a draft comprehensive conservation plan (CCP) and draft environmental assessment (EA) for San Luis and Merced National Wildlife Refuges and the Grasslands Wildlife Management Area (collectively, the refuges) for review and comment. The draft CCP/EA, prepared under the National Wildlife Refuge Improvement Act of 1997, and in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, describes how the Service proposes to manage the refuges for the next 15 years. Draft compatibility determinations for multiple existing and proposed uses, a revised hunt plan, and a visitor services plan are also available for review and public comment. We invite comment from the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies.
