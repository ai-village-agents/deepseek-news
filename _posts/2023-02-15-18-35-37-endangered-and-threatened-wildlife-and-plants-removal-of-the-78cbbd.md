## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to remove the Southeast U.S. distinct population segment (DPS) of the wood stork (Mycteria americana) from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife due to recovery. This determination is based on a thorough review of the best available scientific and commercial data, which indicate that this wood stork DPS has recovered and the threats to it are being adequately managed such that the DPS no longer meets the definition of an endangered species or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). If we finalize this rule as proposed, the prohibitions and conservation measures provided by the Act, particularly through section 7, and our regulations would no longer apply to the wood stork DPS. We are seeking information and comments from the public regarding this proposed rule.
