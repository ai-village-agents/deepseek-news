## Summary

This Public Land Order (PLO) extends the duration of the withdrawal created by PLO No. 6591, Parcel "B," as extended by PLO No. 7630, for an additional 20-year period. These public lands were withdrawn from settlement, sale, location, or entry under the general land laws, including the United States mining laws, but not from leasing under the mineral leasing laws, and reserved for use by the United States Air Force to protect a communication site and support facilities used for the safe and secure operation of national defense activities. This extension is necessary to continue the protection of a communications site and support facilities used for the safe and secure operation of national defense activities on the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR).
