## Summary

The Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission or CPSC) is proposing to codify in the Code of Federal Regulations the statutory requirements for the flammability of upholstered furniture under the COVID-19 Regulatory Relief and Work From Home Safety Act. This Act mandates that CPSC promulgate California Technical Bulletin 117-2013 as a flammability standard for upholstered furniture under section 4 of the Flammable Fabrics Act. In the "Rules and Regulations" section in this issue of the Federal Register, the Commission is issuing this determination as a direct final rule. If we receive no significant adverse comment in response to the direct final rule, we will not take further action on this proposed rule.
