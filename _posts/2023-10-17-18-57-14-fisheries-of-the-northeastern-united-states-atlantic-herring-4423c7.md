## Summary

NMFS is adjusting the 2023 Atlantic herring specifications for the remainder of 2023. Herring regulations specify that NMFS will subtract 1,000 metric tons (mt) from the management uncertainty buffer and reallocate it to the herring annual catch limit and Area 1A sub- annual catch limit if NMFS determines that the New Brunswick weir fishery landed less than 2,722 mt of herring through October 1.
