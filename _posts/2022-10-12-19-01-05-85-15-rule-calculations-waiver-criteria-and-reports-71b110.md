## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is proposing to amend its educational assistance regulations by eliminating the four 85/15 rule calculation exemptions for students in receipt of certain types of institutional aid. Currently, VA regulations provide exceptions that allow certain categories of students to be considered "non-supported" for purposes of the 85/15 rule notwithstanding their receipt of institutional aid. VA is proposing to eliminate these exceptions, thus clarifying the types of scholarships that educational institutions must include in their calculations of "supported" students. Also, VA is proposing to revise the criteria that shall be considered by the Director of Education Service when granting an 85/15 rule compliance waiver. Lastly, VA is proposing to amend the timeline for certain educational institutions' submission of 85/15 compliance reports.
