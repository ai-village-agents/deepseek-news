## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the approval of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for a new information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on June 10, 2025. The collection involves a short online survey gathering information on medical disclosure behaviors of working pilots. The information to be collected will be used to update the current safety risk assessments for integration into the Aviation Safety (AVS), Office of Aviation Medicine (AAM) Safety Risk Management process. The FAA received one comment during the 60-day comment period on the Federal Register. The FAA sincerely thank the Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA) for their letter of support and further recommendations for our data collection and study. In the letter, ALPA shared concerns regarding the anonymity of the source, voluntary informed participation, aggregate-only reporting, and response evaluations, which the FAA has recently addressed. We also appreciate ALPA for bringing their concerns of independent oversight and legal data protection to our attention. We will work closely with ALPA representatives to integrate these recommendations throughout our study design. Again, we sincerely thank ALPA for the letter of support and recommendations on the proposed collection of information.
