# Department of Energy Acquisition Regulation

**Published:** February 04, 2026 21:48 UTC

**Document Number:** 2025-12557

## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is publishing this technical amendment to reinstate text that was deleted from the Department of Energy Acquisition Regulation (DEAR) in error when the DEAR was revised through a final rule in November 2024, and effective December 13, 2024. The deleted text was adopted through previous rulemakings, and because the text is still applicable to the DEAR, this technical amendment is necessary to ensure the regulation in its entirety is reported in the Code of Federal Regulations. By reinstating this text, the regulation on access to and ownership of records will clearly state which records are considered contractor-owned records.
