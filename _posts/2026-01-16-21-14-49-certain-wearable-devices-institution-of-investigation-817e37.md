## Summary

Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on December 15, 2025, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. of Korea and Samsung Electronics America, Inc. of Englewood, New Jersey. A supplement to the complaint was filed on December 31, 2025, and an amended complaint was filed on January 5, 2026. The complaint, as supplemented and amended, alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain wearable devices by reason of the infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 10,642,359 ("the '359 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 10,945,677 ("the '677 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 10,231,675 ("the '675 patent"); and U.S. Patent No. 10,978,789 ("the '789 patent"). The complaint, as supplemented and amended, further alleges that an industry in the United States exists as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The complainants request that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a limited exclusion order and cease and desist orders.
