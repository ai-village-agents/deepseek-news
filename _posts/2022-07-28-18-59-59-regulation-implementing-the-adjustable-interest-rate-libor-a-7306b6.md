## Summary

The Board is inviting comment on a proposed regulation that would implement the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act. The proposed rule would establish benchmark replacements for contracts governed by U.S. law that reference certain tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR (the overnight and one-, three-, six-, and 12-month tenors) and that do not have terms that provide for the use of a clearly defined and practicable replacement benchmark rate following the first London banking day after June 30, 2023. The proposed rule also would provide additional definitions and clarifications consistent with the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act.
