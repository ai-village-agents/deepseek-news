## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) adopts orders resolving pending issues associated with white space devices and databases. The actions being taken will provide additional certainty to white space device users, manufacturers and database administrators to enable unlicensed white space devices to operate efficiently and protect other spectrum users, in particular wireless microphone users. In the Second Order on Reconsideration, the Commission addresses petitions for reconsideration of the requirement established in the Commission's White Spaces Report and Order that white space databases "push" channel availability changes to white space devices when a licensed wireless microphone operator registers in the white space database to use a TV channel. The Commission removes the push notification requirement and replaces it with a simpler rule that requires certain white space devices to re-check the database more frequently. In the Order, the Commission denies a petition for reconsideration of the Office of Engineering and Technology's (OET's) designation of Nominet UK (now RED Technologies) as a white space database administrator.
