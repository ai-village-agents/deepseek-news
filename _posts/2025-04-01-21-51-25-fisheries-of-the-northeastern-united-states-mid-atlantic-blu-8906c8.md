## Summary

In this action, NMFS proposes specifications for the 2025 fishing year for the golden tilefish and blueline tilefish fisheries north of the North Carolina/Virginia border and projects specifications for the 2026 and 2027 golden tilefish fishery. The proposed action is necessary to establish allowable harvest levels and other management measures to prevent overfishing while allowing optimum yield, consistent with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act) and the Tilefish Fishery Management Plan (FMP).
