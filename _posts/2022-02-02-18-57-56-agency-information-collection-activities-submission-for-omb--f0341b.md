# Agency Information Collection Activities: Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request

## Summary

We have submitted a request to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval to continue to use three currently approved information collections. People use the first information collection to request permission to film, photograph, or videotape at a NARA facility for news purposes. People use the second and third information collections to request permission to use NARA facilities for events in the Washington, DC, area, at a Federal records center, or at a Presidential library. Previously, we have handled each of these last two items as separate information collections, but we have recently revised the underlying regulation and the processes for requesting use of different kinds of NARA facilities, so we are proposing to combine these two into one ICR. All three collections are based on requirements in the same regulation. We invite you to comment on the proposed information collections.
