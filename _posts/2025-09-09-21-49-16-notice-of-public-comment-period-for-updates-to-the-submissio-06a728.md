## Summary

The National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) has released a draft update to the Submission Guidelines for public review. Agencies that are subject to plan and project review submit development proposals to the Commission by following the process laid out in the Submission Guidelines. These guidelines describe the content of submissions, submission stages, along with the coordination and review process. The Guidelines were last amended in June 2024 in response to Executive Order 13985 (Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government). By way of Executive Order 14148, Executive Order 13985 was rescinded, and Executive Order 14151 (Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing) was signed. Together, these orders required federal agencies to undo or amend agency regulations and policies that were made in accordance with Executive Order 13985 or which focused on a similar purpose, thereby necessitating revisions to the Guidelines. The draft update reverts the Guidelines to the version that existed prior to June 2024. The Submission Guidelines Update is available online at: https://www.ncpc.gov/participate/notices/.
