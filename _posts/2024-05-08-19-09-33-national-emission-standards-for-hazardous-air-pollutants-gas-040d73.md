## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing the technology reviews (TR) conducted for the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) for gasoline distribution facilities and the review of the new source performance standards (NSPS) for bulk gasoline terminals pursuant to the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA). The final NESHAP amendments include revised requirements for storage vessels, loading operations, and equipment to reflect cost-effective developments in practices, processes, or controls. The final NSPS reflect the best system of emission reduction for loading operations and equipment leaks. In addition, the EPA is: finalizing revisions related to emissions during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM); adding requirements for electronic reporting; revising monitoring and operating requirements for control devices; and making other minor technical improvements. The EPA estimates that this final action will reduce hazardous air pollutant emissions from gasoline distribution facilities by over 2,200 tons per year (tpy) and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions by 45,400 tpy.
