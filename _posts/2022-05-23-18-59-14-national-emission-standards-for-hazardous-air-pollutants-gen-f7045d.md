## Summary

In this action, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is making technical corrections to the general provisions of the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP). Specifically, on November 19, 2021, EPA finalized changes to the NESHAPs for Refractory Products Manufacturing, Carbon Black Production (major sources), Cyanide Chemicals Manufacturing, and Carbon Black Production Area Sources and, also amended the general provisions. Following signature, the EPA discovered inadvertent minor errors in the ordering of the standards and methods that were being incorporated by reference in these rules. The Office of the Federal Register (OFR) was unable to complete the amendatory instructions, resulting in regulatory text intended for the general provisions to be omitted.
