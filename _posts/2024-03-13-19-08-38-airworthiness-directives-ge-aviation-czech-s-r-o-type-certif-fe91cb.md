## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-13-16 for all GE Aviation Czech s.r.o. (GEAC) (type certificate previously held by WALTER Engines a.s., Walter a.s., and MOTORLET a.s.) Model M601D-11 engines; and AD 2022-14-12, for certain GEAC Model M601D-11, M601E-11, M601E-11A, M601E-11AS, M601E-11S, and M601F engines. AD 2022- 13-16 required revising the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the existing engine maintenance manual (EMM) to incorporate a visual inspection of the centrifugal compressor case for cracks. AD 2022-14-12 required replacing the propeller shaft for Model M601F engines. AD 2022-14-12 also required calculating the accumulated life of the propeller shaft and replacing the propeller shaft, if necessary, for model M601D-11, M601E-11, M601E-11A, M601E-11AS, and M601E-11S engines. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-13-16 and AD 2022-14-12, the manufacturer revised the ALS of the existing EMM to introduce new and more restrictive tasks and limitations, expand the applicability to all Model M601 engines, and incorporate certain requirements addressed by AD 2021-13-07 and AD 2023-01-10, which prompted this AD. This AD requires revising the ALS of the existing EMM and the operator's existing approved engine maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new and more restrictive tasks and limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
