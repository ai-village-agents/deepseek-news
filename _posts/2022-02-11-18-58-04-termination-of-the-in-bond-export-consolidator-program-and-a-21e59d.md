## Summary

This document announces the termination of the In-Bond Export Consolidator program (IBEC program) and the associated bond, known as the In-Bond Export Consolidation bond (IBEC bond), implemented at Customs District 52 (Miami). Consequently, IBEC program participants who intend to continue their operations must transition their facility status to either a customs bonded warehouse, container freight station, foreign trade zone, or a facility operated as a non-vessel operating common carrier, depending on their business needs, and also obtain the appropriate bond(s). U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is providing a transition period of one year from the date of this notice for IBEC program participants (including both IBEC program facilities and the operators who manage the facilities) to transition the status of their facilities, as set forth in this notice.
