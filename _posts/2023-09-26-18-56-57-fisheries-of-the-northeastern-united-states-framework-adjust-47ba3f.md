## Summary

This action proposes to implement the New England Fishery Management Council's Framework Adjustment that would identify a Habitat Area of Particular Concern offshore of Southern New England. This rule would adjust the following fishery management plans: Northeast Multispecies; Atlantic Sea Scallop; Monkfish; Northeast Skate Complex; and Atlantic Herring. The proposed Habitat Area of Particular Concern would be within and around wind lease areas in Southern New England, including Cox Ledge, to focus conservation recommendations on cod spawning habitats and complex benthic habitats that are known to serve important habitat functions to Council-managed fishery species.
