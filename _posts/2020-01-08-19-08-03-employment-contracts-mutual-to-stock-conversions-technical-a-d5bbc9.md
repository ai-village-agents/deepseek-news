## Summary

The OCC seeks comment on a proposed rule that would implement changes recommended in the March 2017 Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act report, including the repeal of the OCC's employment contract rule for Federal savings associations, and amend the OCC's fiduciary rules. The proposed rule also would amend the OCC's rule for conversions from mutual to stock form of a savings association to reduce burden, increase flexibility, and update cross-references. Additionally, the proposed rule would update cross-references to repealed and integrated rules, remove unnecessary definitions, and make technical changes to other OCC rules.
