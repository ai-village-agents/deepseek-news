## Summary

The United States Forest Service (USFS) filed an application with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) requesting that the Secretary of the Interior withdraw 2,841 acres of National Forest System lands from location and entry under the United States mining laws, but not from leasing under the mineral or geothermal leasing laws or disposal under the Mineral Materials Act of 1947, for up to 50 years, subject to valid existing rights, to maintain, protect, and conserve critical habitat for listed threatened and endangered plant species in the San Bernardino National Forest, California. This notice segregates the lands from location and entry under the United States mining laws, but not from leasing under the mineral or geothermal leasing laws or disposal under the Mineral Materials Act of 1947, subject to valid existing rights for up to two years, while the application is being considered. The application also includes 280 acres of non-Federal lands within the boundaries of the San Bernardino National Forest that, if acquired, would be subject to this notice. The land described in this notice would remain open to such forms of disposition allowed by law on National Forest System land. This notice also gives the public an opportunity to comment on the withdrawal application and to request a public meeting.
