## Summary

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) seeks public comment on a proposed rule that would revise OMB's regulations implementing the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). These revisions would update OMB's regulations to reflect changes in OMB's current organizational structure and best practices. The proposed amendments would also ensure consistency between the access to records procedures in OMB's Privacy Act regulations and OMB's FOIA regulations; and with applicable law and policies that were enacted after OMB originally issued its Privacy Act regulations in 1976. The proposed revisions would also align OMB's regulations with those of other agencies.
