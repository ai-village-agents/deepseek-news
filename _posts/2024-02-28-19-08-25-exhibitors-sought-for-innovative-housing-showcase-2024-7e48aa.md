## Summary

HUD, in collaboration with other organizations, will present the Innovative Housing Showcase in June 2024 on the National Mall in Washington, DC. The Innovative Housing Showcase (Showcase) is a public event to raise awareness of innovative housing designs and technologies that have the potential to increase housing supply, lower the cost of construction, and/or reduce housing expenses for owners and renters. HUD is especially interested in innovative housing designs and technologies that, in addition to reducing costs and expenses for builders, owners and renters, can expand quality, affordable, accessible and healthy housing options for low- and moderate-income households; support aging in place; improve climate mitigation and resilience and disaster recovery; and/or increase energy efficiency and support decarbonization in the housing sector. HUD is seeking exhibitors to showcase innovations, and this notice solicits proposals for the Innovative Housing Showcase, with a preference for full-scale housing models and technology demonstrations that the public can tour and interact with.
