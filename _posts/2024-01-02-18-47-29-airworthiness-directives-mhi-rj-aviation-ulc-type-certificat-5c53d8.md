## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain MHI RJ Model CL-600-2C10 (Regional Jet Series 700, 701 & 702), CL-600-2C11 (Regional Jet Series 550), CL-600-2D15 (Regional Jet Series 705), CL-600-2D24 (Regional Jet Series 900), and CL-600-2E25 (Regional Jet Series 1000) airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of a passenger seat Y-belt (lap belt) re-installed in the wrong orientation, due to an incorrect maintenance manual. This AD requires inspecting certain Y-belts for correct installation and damage and corrective actions if necessary. This AD also prohibits the use of certain revisions of a maintenance task. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
