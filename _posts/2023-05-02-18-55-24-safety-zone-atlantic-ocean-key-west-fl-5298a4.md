## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a safety zone to be enforced in the event of hurricanes, tropical storms, and other disasters in the Florida Keys. This action is necessary to ensure the safety of the waters of the Key West Captain of the Port (COTP) zone Key West, FL. This proposed rulemaking would establish actions to be completed by industry and vessels in the COTP zone prior to landfall of hurricanes, tropical storms, and other disasters threatening the Florida Keys. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
