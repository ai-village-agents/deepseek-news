## Summary

NMFS has received a request from the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) for the Renewal of their currently active incidental harassment authorization (IHA) to take marine mammals incidental to training exercises at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Cherry Point Range Complex, North Carolina. These activities are identical to those covered in the currently active authorization, which is effective through May 17, 2021. Pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act, prior to issuing the currently active IHA, NMFS requested comments on both the proposed IHA and the potential for renewing the initial authorization if certain requirements were satisfied. The Renewal requirements have been satisfied, and NMFS is now providing an additional 15-day comment period to allow for any additional comments on the proposed Renewal not previously provided during the initial 30- day comment period. If issued, the Renewal IHA would be effective for a period of one year, from May 18, 2021, through May 17, 2022.
