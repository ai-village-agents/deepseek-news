## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing our determination that the Sacramento Metro, California area attained the 2008 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) by its December 31, 2024 attainment date. This determination is based on quality-assured and certified ambient air quality monitoring data from 2022 through 2024. We are also finalizing a determination that the requirement for the State to have contingency measures for reasonable further progress (RFP) and attainment for the 2008 ozone NAAQS no longer applies for this area.
