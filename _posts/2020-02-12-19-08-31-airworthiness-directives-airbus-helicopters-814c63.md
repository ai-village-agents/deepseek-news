# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Airbus Helicopters Model AS332C, AS332C1, AS332L, AS332L1, AS332L2, and EC225LP helicopters. This proposed AD would require revising the Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) for your helicopter and either installing placards or removing the hoist arm. This proposed AD was prompted by a failure of a right-hand (RH) side lateral sliding plug door (sliding door) to jettison. The actions of this proposed AD are intended to address an unsafe condition on these products.
