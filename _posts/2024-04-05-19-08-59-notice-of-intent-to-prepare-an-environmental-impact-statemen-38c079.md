## Summary

The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Iowa State Office announces its intent to prepare a watershed plan for the Clarke County Water Supply project, which is located approximately 27.2 miles upstream of the confluence with the South River in the proximity of Osceola, Iowa. The proposed watershed plan will examine alternative solutions to the limited availability of a reliable water supply. The Clarke County Water Supply project includes the cities of Osceola, Murray, and Woodburn, Iowa, and the Clarke County rural service area. NRCS is requesting comments to identify significant issues, potential alternatives, information, and analyses relevant to the proposed action from all interested individuals, Federal and State agencies, and Tribes.
