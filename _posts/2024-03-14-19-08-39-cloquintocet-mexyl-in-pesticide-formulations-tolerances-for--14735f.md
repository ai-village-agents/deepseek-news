## Summary

This regulation amends the tolerance expression for residues of the safener cloquintocet-mexyl (acetic acid, [(5-chloro-8- quinolinyl)oxy]-, 1-methylhexyl ester) (CAS Reg. No. 99607-70-2) and its acid metabolite (5-chloro-8-quinlinoxyacetic acid) by removing the active ingredients listed in the tolerance expression so that the safener can be used in any herbicide formulation applied to the listed commodities. Corteva Agriscience submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting the revision to the tolerance expression for residues of the safener cloquintocet- mexyl. There is no change to the numerical tolerances or the listed commodities.
