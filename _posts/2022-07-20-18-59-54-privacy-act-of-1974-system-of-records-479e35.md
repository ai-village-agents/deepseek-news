## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the DoD is establishing a new system of records titled, "OIG Data Analytics Platform, CIG-30." This system of records covers the DoD OIG collection and maintenance of records necessary in order to fulfill the responsibilities of the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended. The DoD OIG will use this system of records to develop data models and analytical assessments that will assist with the performance of audits, evaluations, investigations, and reviews in order to identify fraud, waste, and abuse relating to the programs and operations of the DoD. Additionally, DoD is issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which proposes to exempt this system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act, elsewhere in today's issue of the Federal Register.
