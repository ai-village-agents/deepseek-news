## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled "Chronic Q fever in the United States: Enhanced Clinical Surveillance". This enhanced medical surveillance for chronic Q fever will collect specific clinical data not otherwise collected during routine public health surveillance to allow for better characterization of the clinical presentation and risk factors of chronic Q fever in the United States.
