## Summary

The Maritime Administration (MARAD) requests applications from qualified candidates to enter into Maritime Security Program (MSP) Operating Agreements for the operation of two U.S.-registered merchant vessels in international trade, subject to the availability of appropriations. The MSP maintains a fleet of active, commercially viable, militarily useful, privately-owned U.S.-flagged vessels that are engaged in international trade and are capable of supporting both U.S. economic competitiveness in peacetime and national defense and security requirements in times of conflict or emergency. This request for applications provides, among other things, application criteria and a deadline for submitting applications for vessel enrollment into MSP.
