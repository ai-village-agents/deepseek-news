## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of potential foreign object debris (FOD) contamination of the thermal relief valve (TRV). This AD requires replacement of affected auxiliary power unit (APU) low-pressure (LP) shut-off valves (SOVs), an inspection to detect fuel leaks of affected engine LP SOVs and APU isolation shut-off valves (ISOVs), and applicable corrective actions, and prohibits installation of affected parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference (IBR). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
