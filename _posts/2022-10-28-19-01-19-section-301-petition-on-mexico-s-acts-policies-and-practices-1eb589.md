## Summary

On September 8, 2022, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) received a petition requesting an investigation of certain alleged acts, policies, and practices of the government of Mexico concerning seasonal and perishable agricultural products. Due to the complexities of the factual and legal issues raised in the petition, the U.S. Trade Representative could not conclude during the 45-day statutory review period that an investigation would be effective and is not opening an investigation at this time. In light of challenges faced by U.S. producers, USTR in coordination with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will establish a private-sector industry advisory panel to recommend measures to promote the competitiveness of producers of seasonal and perishable produce in the southeastern United States. Furthermore, USTR and USDA will work with the petitioners and producers to examine the issues raised in the petition and to consider any further actions that may be appropriate.
