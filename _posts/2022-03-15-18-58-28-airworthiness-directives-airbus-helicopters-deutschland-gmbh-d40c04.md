## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (AHD) Model MBB-BK 117 C-2 and MBB-BK 117 D-2 helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of erroneous or partial installation of the seat belt restraint system. This AD requires inspecting certain seats, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
