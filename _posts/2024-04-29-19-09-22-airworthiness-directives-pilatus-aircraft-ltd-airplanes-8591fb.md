## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-12- 17, which applied to Pilatus Aircraft Ltd. (Pilatus) Model PC-12, PC- 12/45, PC-12/47, and PC-12/47E airplanes. AD 2023-12-17 required revising the airworthiness limitation section (ALS) of the existing aircraft maintenance manual (AMM) or Instructions for Continued Airworthiness (ICA) for your airplane by introducing new and more restrictive instructions and maintenance tasks as specified in the component limitations section, which includes repetitive inspections for cracks in the lower main spar connection of the horizontal stabilizer. Since the FAA issued AD 2023-12-17, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD requires revising the ALS of your existing AMM or ICA and your existing approved maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
