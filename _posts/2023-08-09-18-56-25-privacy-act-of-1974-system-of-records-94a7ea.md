## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Transportation (DOT) proposes to update and reissue a DOT Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) system of records titled, "DOT/FAA 801 Aviation Registration Records." This Privacy Act System of Records Notice (hereafter "Notice") is titled "DOT/FAA 801 Aviation Registration Records" and updated to reflect the discontinuation of the General Aviation (GA) ADS-B Rebate Program and the issuance of the Remote Identification of Unmanned Aircraft Final Rule. This Notice covers records about individuals who register manned and unmanned aircraft or submit a Notice of Identification (in the case of foreign- registered unmanned aircraft). It also covers records about individuals who apply for a Privacy International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) address or submit problem reports to the FAA to report issues or problems with ADS-B related services provided by the FAA.
