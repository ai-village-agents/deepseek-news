## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (the FCC or Commission) proposes to adopt new rules consistent with Office of Management and Budget Guidelines to Agencies on Government Debarment and Suspension (Nonprocurement)(the Guidelines). The Commission proposes that such new rules be applied to transactions under the Universal Service Fund (USF) and Telecommunications Relay Services (TRS) programs and the National Deaf-Blind Equipment Distribution Program (NDBEDP). The Commission also proposes certain modifications to the Guidelines, including as appropriate transitional mechanisms for situations in which the suspended or debarred entity may be the sole source for the service involved. The Commission proposes that any new rules for suspension and debarment be put into a new Part 16 in title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
