## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) debarring Jagen Lewicki for a period of 5 years from importing or offering for import any drug into the United States. FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Lewicki was convicted, as defined in the FD&C Act, of one felony count under Federal law for conspiracy to distribute Human Growth Hormone (HGH) imported from China for a purpose other than the treatment of a disease or other recognized medical condition, the use of which had been authorized by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and not pursuant to an order of a physician, in violation of the FD&C Act. The factual basis supporting this felony conviction, as described below, is conduct relating to the importation into the United States of a drug or controlled substance. Mr. Lewicki was given notice of the proposed debarment and, in accordance with the FD&C Act and FDA's regulations, was given an opportunity to request a hearing to show why he should not be debarred. As of October 28, 2019 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Mr. Lewicki had not responded. Mr. Lewicki's failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this matter.
