## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to list the oblong rocksnail (Leptoxis compacta), a freshwater snail native to the Cahaba River in Alabama, as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). This determination also serves as our 12-month finding on a petition to list the oblong rocksnail. After a review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that listing the species is warranted. If we finalize this rule as proposed, it will add this species to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and extend the Act's protections to the species.
