## Summary

The FAA is correcting an airworthiness directive (AD) that published in the Federal Register. That AD applies to all The Boeing Company Model 737-100, -200, -200C, -300, -400, and -500 series airplanes. As published, the service information reference specified in a certain paragraph of the regulatory text is incorrect. This document corrects that error. In all other respects, the original document remains the same.
