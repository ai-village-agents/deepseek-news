## Summary

This interim final rule ("rule") revokes regulations of the Department of Justice ("Department") that codified a prohibition, subject to limited exceptions, on the inclusion of provisions in settlement agreements directing or providing for a payment or loan, in cash or in kind, to any non-governmental person or entity that is not a party to the dispute. For further information on how the Department intends to approach such settlements going forward, interested parties should consult an Attorney General Memorandum that the Department is issuing on its website in conjunction with this rule. Comments are requested both as to this rule and as to that Memorandum.
