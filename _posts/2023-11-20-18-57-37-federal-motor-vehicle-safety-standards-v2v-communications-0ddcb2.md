## Summary

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration withdraws a previous proposal to create a new Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard requiring vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications in new light vehicles. After the advent of new V2V communications protocol, and after a recent Federal Communications Commission (FCC) decision regarding the regulations governing the 5.850-5.895 gigahertz (5.9 GHz) band, the agency has decided to withdraw its V2V proposed rule.
