## Summary

The U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of International Labor Affairs ("ILAB") amends its procedural guidelines ("Guidelines") for the development and maintenance of a list of goods from countries that ILAB has reason to believe are produced by child labor or forced labor in violation of international standards ("List"). The Guidelines establish the process for the public submission of information and the evaluation and reporting process to be used by the U.S. Department of Labor's ("DOL or Department") Office of Child Labor, Forced Labor, and Human Trafficking ("Office") in ILAB in maintaining and updating the List. DOL is required to develop and make available to the public the List pursuant to the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005.
