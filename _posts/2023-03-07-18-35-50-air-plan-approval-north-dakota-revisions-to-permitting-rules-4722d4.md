## Summary

In accordance with the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted by North Dakota on August 3, 2020. The revisions contain amendments to the State's Ambient Air Quality Standards, Permit to Construct, and Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) regulations. In addition, we are correcting the citation to a revision to North Dakota Administrative Code (NDAC) section 33.1-15-20-04.4. In our proposal, we provided the incorrect citation to section 33.1-15-20-04.3.
