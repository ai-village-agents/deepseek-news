## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC, Commission, or Agency) has modified an existing system of records, FCC/OWD-1, Reasonable Accommodation Requests, subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. This action is necessary to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act to publish in the Federal Register notice of the existence and character of records maintained by the agency. The FCC's Office of Workforce Diversity (OWD) uses this system to provide a method by which the FCC can identify Commission employees who have requested accommodations related to: religion; disability; or pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. Information on the disposition of each request is also maintained in this system.
