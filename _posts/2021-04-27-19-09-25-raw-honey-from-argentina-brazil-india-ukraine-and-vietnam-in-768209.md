The Commission hereby gives notice of the institution of investigations and commencement of preliminary phase antidumping duty investigation Nos. 731-TA-1560-1564 (Preliminary) pursuant to the Tariff Act of 1930 ("the Act") to determine whether there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is materially injured or threatened with material injury, or the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded, by reason of imports of raw honey from Argentina, Brazil, India, Ukraine, and Vietnam, provided for in heading 0409.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, that are alleged to be sold in the United States at less than fair value.
