## Summary

The Drug Enforcement Administration proposes placing the substance ethylphenidate (chemical name: ethyl 2-phenyl-2-(piperidin-2- yl)acetate), including its salts, isomers, and salts of isomers, in schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. This action is being taken, in part, to enable the United States to meet its obligations under the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. If finalized, this action would impose the regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions applicable to schedule I controlled substances on persons who handle (manufacture, distribute, reverse distribute, import, export, engage in research, conduct instructional activities or chemical analysis, or possess) or propose to handle ethylphenidate.
