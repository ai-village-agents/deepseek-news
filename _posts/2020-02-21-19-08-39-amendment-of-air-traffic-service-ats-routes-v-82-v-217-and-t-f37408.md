## Summary

This action amends two VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways, V-82 and V-217, and one area navigation (RNAV) route, T-383. The FAA is taking this action due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Baudette VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) navigation aid (NAVAID). The Baudette VOR is being decommissioned in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
