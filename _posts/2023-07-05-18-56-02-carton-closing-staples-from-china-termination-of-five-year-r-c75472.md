## Summary

The Commission instituted the subject five-year review on April 3, 2023 to determine whether revocation of the antidumping duty order on carton-closing staples from China would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury. On June 22, 2023, the Department of Commerce published notice that it was revoking the order effective May 8, 2023, because no domestic interested party filed a timely notice of intent to participate. Accordingly, the subject review is terminated.
