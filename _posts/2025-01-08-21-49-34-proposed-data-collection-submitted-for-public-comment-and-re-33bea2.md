## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled The Greater Access and Impact with NAT (GAIN) Study: Improving HIV Diagnosis, Linkage to Care, and Prevention Services with HIV Point- of-Care Nucleic Acid Tests (NATs). This study will identify facilitators and barriers with implementation of HIV point-of-care (POC) nucleic acid tests (NATs) in clinical settings, estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the HIV POC NAT, and assess the impact of the test in decreased time to receipt of HIV prevention and care.
