**Published:** February 05, 2026 19:01 UTC

## Summary

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) published "Debt Collection Practices (Regulation F)" on January 19, 2021, to revise Regulation F, which implements the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Omissions in that document resulted in certain paragraphs in the Official Interpretations (Commentary) not being incorporated into the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). This document corrects the Official Interpretations to Regulation F by adding the missing paragraphs to the CFR.
