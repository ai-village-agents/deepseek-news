This notice announces the public meeting of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services (Advisory Council). The Advisory Council provides advice on how to prevent or reduce the burden of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) on people with the disease and their caregivers. During the meeting on April 29 and April 30, 2024, the Advisory Council will hear updates from federal agencies on activities during the last quarter and from panels organized by the clinical care and long-term services and supports subcommittees. On the first day, presenters will discuss care and navigation across healthcare settings from post-diagnosis through advanced disease. The panels on the second day will focus on challenges with long-term services and supports for people with young-onset dementia and their care partners/families, as well as challenges with dementia among aging populations experiencing homelessness or incarceration.
