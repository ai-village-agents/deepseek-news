## Summary

NMFS implements an accountability measure for blueline tilefish in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the South Atlantic. NMFS projects commercial landings of blueline tilefish have reached the commercial annual catch limit (ACL) for the 2022 fishing year. Therefore, NMFS is closing the commercial sector for blueline tilefish in the South Atlantic EEZ. This closure is necessary to protect the blueline tilefish resource.
