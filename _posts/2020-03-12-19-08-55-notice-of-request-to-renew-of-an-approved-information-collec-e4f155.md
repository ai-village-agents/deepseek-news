## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations, the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is announcing its intention to renew the approved information collection regarding observational studies to inform the development of food safety communication products and an evaluation of public health education and communication activities. The approval for this information collection will expire on June 30, 2020. FSIS has reduced the total burden estimate for the renewal collection by 833 hours because FSIS plans to conclude its research in two years, after the renewal. The original burden estimate was for three years.
