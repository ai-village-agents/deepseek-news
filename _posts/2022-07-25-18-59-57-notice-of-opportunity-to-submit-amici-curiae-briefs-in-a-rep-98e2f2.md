## Summary

The Federal Labor Relations Authority (Authority) provides an opportunity for all interested persons to submit briefs as amicus curiae on an issue arising in a case pending before the Authority. The issue concerns whether section 7111(f)(4) of the Federal Service Labor- Management Relations Statute (the Statute) or Sec. 2422.12(b) of the Authority's Regulations apply to bar decertification petitions filed within twelve months after a labor organization is certified, without an election, as exclusive representative of a consolidated bargaining unit under section 7112 of the Statute. Because this issue is likely to be of concern to agencies, labor organizations, and other interested persons, the Authority finds it appropriate to provide for the filing of amici briefs addressing the above question.
