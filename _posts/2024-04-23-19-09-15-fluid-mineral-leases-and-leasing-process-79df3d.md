## Summary

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is revising its oil and gas leasing regulations. Among other changes, the final rule implements provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) pertaining to royalty rates, rentals, and minimum bids; updates the bonding requirements for leasing, development, and production; and revises some operating requirements. The final rule will improve the BLM's leasing process by ensuring proper stewardship of public lands and resources.
