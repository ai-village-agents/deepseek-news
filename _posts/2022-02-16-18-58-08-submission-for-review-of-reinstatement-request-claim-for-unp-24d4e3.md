## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 as amended by the Clinger-Cohen Act, this notice announces that the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) intends to submit to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request to reinstate a previous approved information collection. Standard Form 1153, Claim for Unpaid Compensation of Deceased Civilian Employee, is used to collect information from individuals who have been designated as beneficiaries of the unpaid compensation of a deceased Federal employee who believe that their relationship to the deceased entitles them to receive the unpaid compensation of the deceased Federal employee. OPM needs this information in order to adjudicate the claim and properly assign a deceased Federal employee's unpaid compensation to the appropriate individual(s).
