## Summary

As part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, FinCEN invites comments on the proposed renewal, without change, of certain existing information collection requirements found in Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) regulations applicable to casinos and card clubs. Under these regulations, among other requirements, casinos and card clubs (collectively, casinos) must secure and maintain--with respect to each deposit, account, or line of credit--a record of the name, permanent address, and social security number of the person involved at the time the funds are deposited, the account is opened, or credit is extended. This request for comments is made pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
