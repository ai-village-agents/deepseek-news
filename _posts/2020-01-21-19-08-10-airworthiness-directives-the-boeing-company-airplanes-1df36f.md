## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for The Boeing Company Model 737-300, -400, and -700 series airplanes, modified to a Bedek Division Special Freighter (BDSF) by Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) ST01566LA, ST01961SE, or ST02556SE, with a 9G rigid barrier. An emergency AD was sent to all known U.S. owners and operators of these airplanes. This AD requires complying with loading restrictions and methods. This AD was prompted by a review of the manufacturing process for the 9G rigid barrier installed on BDSF conversions that identified a manufacturing non-compliance. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
