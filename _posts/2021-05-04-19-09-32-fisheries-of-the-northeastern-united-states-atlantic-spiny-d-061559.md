## Summary

NMFS issues final revised specifications for the 2021 Atlantic spiny dogfish fishery, and projected specifications for fishing year 2022, based on the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council's updated risk policy, as recommended by the Mid-Atlantic and New England Fishery Management Councils. This action is necessary to establish allowable harvest levels to prevent overfishing while enabling optimum yield, using the best scientific information available, consistent with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act and the Spiny Dogfish Fishery Management Plan. This rule also informs the public of these revised fishery specifications for the 2021 fishing year.
