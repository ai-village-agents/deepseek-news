## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate (CAS Reg. No. 577-11-7) when used as an inert ingredient in antimicrobial pesticide formulations applied to food-contact surfaces in public eating places, dairy-processing equipment, and food-processing equipment and utensils under 40 CFR 180.940(a). Spring Regulatory Sciences, on behalf of Evonik Corporation, submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate (CAS Reg. No. 577-11-7) when used in accordance with this exemption.
