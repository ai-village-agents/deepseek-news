## Summary

The Coast Guard announces that the U.S. Coast Guard Fourteenth District Prevention Division has issued a certificate of alternative compliance from the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), for the CGMA CGM DAKA (IMO 9436070). We are issuing this notice because its publication is required by statute. Due to the construction and placement of the forward cargo crane creating a blind sector 1,000 meters immediately ahead of the bow of the vessel over a range of approximately 1-2 degrees, CGMA CGM DAKA cannot fully comply with the light, shape, or sound signal provisions of the 72 COLREGS without interfering with the vessel's design and construction. This notification of issuance of a certificate of alternative compliance promotes the Coast Guard's marine safety mission.
