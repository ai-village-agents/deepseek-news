## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary moving safety zone on a 24-mile stretch of the Ohio River for paddle craft during the 1st Annual Race on the OYO. The safety zone will extend 100 yards from any participating vessel, as they transit from Racine, Ohio to Point Pleasant, West Virginia. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters during a paddle fest on June 17, 2023. This rulemaking prohibits persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Ohio Valley or a designated representative.
