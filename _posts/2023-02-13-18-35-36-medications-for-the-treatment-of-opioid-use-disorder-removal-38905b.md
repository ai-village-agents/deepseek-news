## Summary

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS or "the Department") is issuing this supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) to solicit public comment on its proposal to remove provisions authorized under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), as amended by the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 (DATA-2000). These changes are as a result of amendments made in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, which was enacted on December 29, 2022. Among other things, section 1262(a)(1) of this Act amended the CSA by eliminating the requirement that practitioners obtain a waiver to prescribe certain schedule III-V medications for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD).
