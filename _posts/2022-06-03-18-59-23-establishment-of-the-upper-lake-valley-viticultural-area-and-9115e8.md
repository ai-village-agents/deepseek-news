## Summary

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) establishes the approximately 17,360-acre "Upper Lake Valley" viticultural area in Lake County, California. TTB also expands the boundary of the existing 1,093-square mile Clear Lake viticultural area so that the Upper Lake Valley viticultural area is wholly within it. Both viticultural areas are located within the established North Coast viticultural area. TTB designates viticultural areas to allow vintners to better describe the origin of their wines and to allow consumers to better identify wines they may purchase.
