## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-21-06, which applies to certain Ipeco Holdings Limited (Ipeco) pilot and co-pilot seats. AD 2019-21-06 requires modification and re- identification of the affected seats, initial and repetitive inspections of the affected track lock springs and, depending on the findings, replacement of the track lock springs with a part eligible for installation. Since the FAA issued AD 2019-21-06, the FAA determined the need for a mandatory terminating action to the track lock spring inspections. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of track lock spring failures occurring on affected seats. This proposed AD would retain the requirements of AD 2019-21-06. This proposed AD would also add a mandatory terminating action for the initial and repetitive inspections of the affected track lock springs. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
