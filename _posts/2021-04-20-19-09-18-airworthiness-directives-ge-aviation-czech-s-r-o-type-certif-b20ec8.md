## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all GE Aviation Czech s.r.o. (GEAC) H75-200, H80-100, and H80-200 model turboprop engines. This proposed AD was prompted by several reports of engine gas generator speed (Ng) rollbacks occurring below idle on GEAC H75-200, H80-100, and H80-200 model turboprop engines. This proposed AD would require an inspection of a certain part number (P/N) fuel control unit (FCU) and, if deficiencies are detected, replacement of the FCU with a part eligible for installation. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
