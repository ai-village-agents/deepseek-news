## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-08-04, which applies to certain The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. AD 2023-08-04 requires a detailed visual inspection of all door 1 and door 3 lavatory and galley potable water systems for any missing or incorrectly installed clamshell couplings, and applicable on-condition actions. Since the FAA issued AD 2023-08- 04, Boeing has discovered that some couplings did not have the required safety strap and has developed a design solution that replaces the couplings with couplings that have safety straps. This proposed AD would retain the requirements of AD 2023-08-04 and require, for certain airplanes, a detailed inspection of all clamshell couplings for the presence and correct installation of safety straps at door 1 and door 3 lavatories and galleys with a potable water system, and applicable on- condition actions, which would terminate the existing requirements. The AD would also prohibit the installation of affected parts at inspection locations. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
