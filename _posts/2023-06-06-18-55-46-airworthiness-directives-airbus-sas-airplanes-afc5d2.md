## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-06- 07, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A330-200 Freighter, -200, and -300 series airplanes; and A340-200, -300, -500, and -600 series airplanes. AD 2017-06-07 required identification of potentially affected inboard flap parts, a one-time eddy current inspection to identify which material the parts are made of, and, depending on findings, replacement with serviceable parts. This AD was prompted by a determination that, even if affected inboard flaps were not installed on airplanes during production, affected inboard flaps could be installed on airplanes as spare parts. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2017-06-07, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also reduces the allowance for the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
