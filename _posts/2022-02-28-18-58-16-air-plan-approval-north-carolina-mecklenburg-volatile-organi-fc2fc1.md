## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision to the Mecklenburg County portion of the North Carolina SIP, hereinafter referred to as the Mecklenburg Local Implementation Plan (LIP). The changes were submitted by the State of North Carolina, through the North Carolina Division of Air Quality (NCDAQ), on behalf of Mecklenburg County Air Quality (MCAQ), via a letter dated April 24, 2020, and were received by EPA on June 19, 2020. The SIP revision updates several Mecklenburg County Air Pollution Control Ordinance (MCAPCO) rules incorporated into the LIP, removes several rules, and adds several rules. The rules addressed in this final approval action relate to volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions and include several VOC Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) rules. EPA is finalizing the approval of these changes pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act).
