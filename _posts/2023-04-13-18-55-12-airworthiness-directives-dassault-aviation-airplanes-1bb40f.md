## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-09-03 and AD 2018-20-07, which applied to all Dassault Aviation Model MYSTERE-FALCON 50 airplanes. AD 2017-09-03 and AD 2018-20-07 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. This AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2018-20-07 and requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
