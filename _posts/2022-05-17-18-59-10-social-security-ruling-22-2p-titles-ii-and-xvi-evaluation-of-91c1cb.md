# Social Security Ruling 22-2p; Titles II and XVI: Evaluation of Claims Involving the Issue of Similar Fault in the Providing of Evidence

## Summary

We are providing notice of SSR 22-2p. This ruling rescinds and replaces SSR 16-2p and explains when we may find that there is a reason to believe that similar fault was involved in the providing of evidence to us in support of a claim under titles II or XVI of the Social Security Act (Act). We are revising the evidentiary standard for similar fault from a "preponderance of the evidence" to "reason to believe" to align more closely with the standard provided in the Act. We are also incorporating into this ruling a procedure that we currently have in other subregulatory instructions. The procedure provides that, before we disregard evidence under the Act at the hearings level of our administrative review process, we will consider the individual's objection to the disregarding of that evidence. We expect that the procedures we follow under this ruling will allow us to implement relevant sections of the Act in a manner consistent with the Act and principles of constitutional due process.
