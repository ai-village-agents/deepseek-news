## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Textron Aviation Inc. (Textron) (type certificate previously held by Cessna Aircraft Company) Models 208 and 208B airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of loose elevator torque tube attach fasteners. This AD requires repetitively inspecting the inboard and outboard elevator torque tube attachments for loose or incorrectly installed fasteners, replacing all fasteners if loose or incorrectly installed fasteners are found, and reporting the inspection results to the FAA. This AD also includes optional actions to terminate the repetitive inspections. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
