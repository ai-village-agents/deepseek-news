## Summary

On March 22, 2022, PHMSA announced an initiative to convert historical letters of interpretation (LOI) applicable to the Hazardous Materials Regulations that have been issued to specific stakeholders into broadly applicable frequently asked questions (FAQ). As such, PHMSA requested comment on the initiative and for input on the prioritization of future sets of FAQ. During the initial comment period, several commenters requested that PHMSA further clarify the future disposition of the LOI process and address commenters' initial concerns. In response to this feedback, PHMSA published a second notice on June 13, 2022, extending the comment period to July 22, 2022, and announcing that a webinar would be held on June 27, 2022. In this final notice, PHMSA is responding to comments received from stakeholders, summarizing the webinar event, finalizing the first set of FAQ, and announcing the topic for future FAQ.
