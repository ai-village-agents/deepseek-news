## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of main landing gear (MLG) bogie pivot pins with damaged high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) coating, which resulted from heating caused by friction between the MLG bogie pivot pin and the bushes. This AD requires repetitively greasing the MLG bogie pivot pins, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
