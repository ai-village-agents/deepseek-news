# Magnuson-Stevens Act Provisions; Fisheries of the Northeastern United States; Northeast Multispecies Fishery; Approval of New Gear Under Small-Mesh Fisheries Accountability Measures

## Summary

This action approves new selective trawl gear for use in several non-groundfish fisheries when subject to the Georges Bank yellowtail flounder accountability measure. The selective gear reduces bycatch of groundfish species, while allowing the target fisheries to continue operating when selective trawl gear is required. This selective trawl gear will provide the fishing industry with more flexibility when accountability measures are triggered because there are limited selective trawl gears currently approved for use.
