## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to find that 11 States failed to submit State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions required by the Clean Air Act (CAA) in a timely manner for certain nonattainment areas classified as Moderate for the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The States that failed to submit the required SIP revisions for reclassified Moderate areas are Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, New Jersey, Nevada, Texas, and Wisconsin. This action triggers certain CAA deadlines for the imposition of sanctions if a State does not submit a complete SIP addressing the outstanding requirements and for the EPA to promulgate a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) if the EPA does not approve the State's SIP revision addressing the outstanding requirements.
