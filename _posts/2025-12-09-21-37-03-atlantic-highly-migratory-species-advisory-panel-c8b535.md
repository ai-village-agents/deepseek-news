## Summary

NMFS solicits nominations for the Atlantic Highly Migratory Species (HMS) Advisory Panel (AP). NMFS consults with and considers the comments and views of the HMS AP when preparing and implementing fishery management plans (FMPs) or FMP amendments for Atlantic swordfish, sharks, tunas, and billfish. Nominations are being sought to fill approximately one third (10) of the seats on the HMS AP, each with a 3-year appointment. NMFS will consider individuals with definable interests in recreational and commercial fishing and related industries, including those from the environmental community and non- governmental organizations, for membership on the HMS AP.
