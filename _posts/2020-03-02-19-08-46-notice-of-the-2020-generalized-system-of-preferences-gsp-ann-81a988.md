## Summary

The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) will consider petitions to modify the GSP status of GSP beneficiary developing countries (BDCs) because of country practices; add products to GSP eligibility; remove products from GSP eligibility for one or more countries; waive competitive need limitations (CNLs); deny de minimis waivers for eligible products; or redesignate currently excluded products. This review will include separate hearings on accepted country practice review and product petitions, which USTR will announce in the Federal Register at a later date.
