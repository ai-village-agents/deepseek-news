## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering issuance of an exemption for Three Mile Island Nuclear Station, Unit 1 (TMI-1). The exemption would allow the licensee, Constellation Energy Generation, LLC (CEG) to use a portion of the TMI-1 decommissioning trust fund (DTF) for site restoration activities at TMI-1 without prior notice to the NRC. The NRC is issuing an environmental assessment (EA) and finding of no significant impact (FONSI) associated with the proposed action.
