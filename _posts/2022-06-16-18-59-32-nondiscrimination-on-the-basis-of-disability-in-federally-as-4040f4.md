## Summary

The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) provides notice of its interpretation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and NEH's implementing regulations, which prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability in federally assisted programs and activities. (In order to reflect currently accepted terminology, this notice uses the term "disability" rather than "handicap," which appears in NEH's Section 504 regulations. There is no substantive legal difference between the two terms for purposes of this notice.) This document clarifies that NEH interprets its Section 504 rule to permit recipients of Federal financial assistance from NEH who engage in the design, construction, or alteration of facilities to use the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design (2010 Standards) in lieu of the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS). This notice does not require recipients to use the 2010 Standards.
