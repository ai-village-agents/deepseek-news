The complaint alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain semiconductor devices, mobile devices containing the same, and components thereof by reason of the infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 9,831,306 ("the '306 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 10,319,812 ("the '812 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 10,700,178 ("the '178 patent"); and U.S. Patent No. 11,251,281 ("the '281 patent").

A supplement to the complaint was filed on October 12, 2022. The complainant requests that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a limited exclusion order and cease and desist orders.
