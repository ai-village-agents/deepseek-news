## Summary

As a result of determinations by the Department of Commerce (Commerce) that termination of the Agreements Suspending the Antidumping (AD) and Countervailing (CVD) Duty Investigations on Sugar from Mexico, as amended (the Agreements), and the suspended AD and CVD investigations on sugar from Mexico would likely lead to a continuation or recurrence of dumping and countervailable subsidies, and by the International Trade Commission (ITC) that termination of the suspended AD and CVD investigations would likely lead to material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is publishing this notice of continuation of the AD and CVD Agreements on sugar from Mexico.
