## Summary

Ricon Corporation (Ricon), has determined that certain Mirage, S-Series, and K-Series wheelchair lifts do not fully comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 403, Platform Lift Systems for Motor Vehicles. Because of Ricon's determination, various vehicle manufacturers who installed the S-Series, and K-Series wheelchair lifts in their motor vehicles determined that their motor vehicles do not comply with FMVSS No. 404, Platform Lift Installation in Motor Vehicles. Ricon and the various vehicle manufacturers, collectively referred to as the "the petitioners," filed the appropriate noncompliance reports and subsequently petitioned NHTSA for a decision that the subject noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. This document announces receipt of the petitioners' petitions.
