## Summary

By this rule, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ("NOAA") is eliminating a part of the Code of Federal Regulations that consists solely of a single provision cross- referencing another part of the Code. This action is necessary to streamline and simplify NOAA's regulations. The intended effect of this action is to reduce administrative clutter without altering any substantive rights or obligations.
