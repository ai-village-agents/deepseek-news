## Summary

The FAA proposes to rule and invites public comment on Lakewood Industrial Commission and Lakewood Township to dispose of 59.8036 acres of federally obligated airport property at Lakewood Airport, Lakewood, NJ. This acreage was acquired with federal financial assistance via Airport Improvement Program Federal Grants #3-34-SBGP- 04-95 and 3-34-SBGP-05-96, and grant agreements issued through the New Jersey Department of Aviation under AIP BGP # -34-0076-01-96. The proposed use of land after the release will be consistent with the local zoning of "Airport Business Commercial," and will not interfere with the airport or its operation.
