## Summary

This final rule removes or revises various regulations governing the agency's business loan programs that are obsolete, unnecessary, ineffective, or burdensome. This final rule also makes several technical amendments to incorporate recent statutory changes and other non-substantive changes. In addition, because this final rule removes a regulation that is cross-referenced in a regulation in SBA's Disaster Loan Program, this rule makes one conforming change to the regulation in the Disaster Loan Program.
