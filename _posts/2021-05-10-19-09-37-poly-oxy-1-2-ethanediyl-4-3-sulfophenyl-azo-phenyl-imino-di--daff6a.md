## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of Poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl), [alpha], [alpha]'-{[[4-[(3-sulfophenyl)azo]phenyl]imino]di-2,1- ethanediyl{time} bis[[omega]-hydroxy-, monosodium salt when used as an inert ingredient (colorant) in pesticide formulations applied to seed treatment slurries for raw agricultural commodities and not to exceed 20% weight/weight (wt/wt). Milliken Chemical submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) requesting establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of Poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl), [alpha], [alpha]'-{[[4-[(3- sulfophenyl)azo]phenyl]imino]di-2,1-ethanediyl{time} bis[[omega]- hydroxy-, monosodium salt.
