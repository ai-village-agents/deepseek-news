## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) seeks comment on changes to our rules, policies, or practices to facilitate the acceptance for filing of satellite and earth station applications. We propose to revise a procedural rule to formally allow consideration of satellite applications and petitions that request waiver of the Table of Frequency Allocations to operate in a frequency band without an international allocation. We also seek comment on typical processing timeframes for satellite applications. This document will help Commission processing stay apace with the unprecedented number of innovative satellite applications in the new space age.
