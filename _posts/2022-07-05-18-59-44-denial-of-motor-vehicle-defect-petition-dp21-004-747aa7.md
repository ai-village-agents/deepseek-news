## Summary

This notice sets forth the reasons for the denial of a petition submitted to NHTSA on September 14, 2021, requesting that the agency investigate whether a defect related to motor vehicle safety exists in van-type or box semi-trailers due to a lack of side underride guards. On November 17, 2021, NHTSA opened Defect Petition DP21-004 to evaluate petitioners' request. After a review of the petition and other information, NHTSA has concluded that the issues presented by the petitioners will be examined in work undertaken pursuant to congressional direction under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Accordingly, the agency has denied the petition.
