## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the Missouri State Implementation Plan (SIP) related to the control of emissions from volatile organic liquid storage. The revisions to this rule include adding incorporations by reference to other state rules, adding definitions specific to the rule, revising unnecessarily restrictive or duplicative language, and making administrative wording changes. These revisions do not impact the stringency of the SIP or have an adverse effect on air quality. The EPA's proposed approval of this rule revision is being done in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
