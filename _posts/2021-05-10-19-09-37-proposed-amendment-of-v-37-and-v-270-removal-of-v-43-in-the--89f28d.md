## Summary

This action proposes to amend two VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways and remove one VOR Federal airway in the vicinity of Erie, Pennsylvania. The FAA proposes this action due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Erie, PA, VOR/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) that these airways utilize for navigation guidance. The Erie VOR is being decommissioned as part of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
