## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-21-13, which applies to certain Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd. & Co KG (RRD) Model Trent 1000 engines. AD 2021-21-13 requires the operator to revise the airworthiness limitation section (ALS) of their existing approved aircraft maintenance program (AMP) by incorporating the revised tasks of the applicable time limits manual (TLM) for each affected model turbofan engine. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-21-13, the manufacturer has revised the TLM, introducing new and more restrictive instructions. This proposed AD would require revisions to the ALS of the operator's existing approved AMP, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
