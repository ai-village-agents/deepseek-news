## Summary

Pursuant to the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA), the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is issuing this final rule establishing a safety standard for crib mattresses, which includes full-size and non-full-size crib mattresses, as well as after-market mattresses for play yards and non-full-size cribs. CPSC is also finalizing an amendment to its regulations regarding third party conformity assessment bodies, to include the safety standard for crib mattresses in the list of notices of requirements (NORs) along with an amendment to the consumer registration rule, to identify crib mattresses as a durable infant or toddler product subject to consumer registration requirements.
