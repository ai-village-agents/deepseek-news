## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on November 15, 2022. The information to be collected is necessary to insure the safety of the flying public. Documentation of maintenance repair actions record who, what, when, where and how of the task performed. All maintenance actions as well as documentation are required by the Code of Federal Regulations. This collection focuses on the Form 337 which is collected by the FAA as required by Federal Aviation Regulation Part 43. Other records for preventative maintenance, and logbook entries are not collected by the FAA serve as a responsibility of the owner to maintain in case of verification of airworthiness when seeking approvals or sale of the aircraft. This insures proper certification of personnel; proper tooling is utilized and accurate measures to insure safety. Total form 337s submitted in 2017 is 54,237. Total aircraft registrations on file is 289,490. It is estimated by the numbers collected one in every five aircraft have a 337 form submitted for major alteration and repairs performed. Each 337 takes approximately 1 hour.
