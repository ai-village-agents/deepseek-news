## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing amendments to the New Source Performance Standards and Emission Guidelines for Existing Sources for the Crude Oil and Natural Gas Source Category in response to petitions for reconsideration. Specifically, this action proposes discrete technical changes to two different aspects of the rules. First, this action proposes discrete technical changes to the temporary flaring provisions for associated gas in certain situations. Second, this action proposes discrete technical changes to the vent gas net heating value (NHV) continuous monitoring requirements and alternative performance test (sampling demonstration) option for flares and enclosed combustion devices. In a letter dated May 6, 2024, the EPA notified petitioners and the public that the Agency granted reconsideration on these two aspects of the March 8, 2024 (89 FR 16820) final rule. These amendments neither propose changes to any other aspect of the final rule, nor propose to alter the substance of any emission standards within the final rule. Also, in this action, the EPA proposes to make formatting changes to the regulatory text to meet the required formatting standards of the Office of the Federal Register.
