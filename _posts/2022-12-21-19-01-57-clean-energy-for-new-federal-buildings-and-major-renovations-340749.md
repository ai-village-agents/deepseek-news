## Summary

The Department of Energy ("DOE") is publishing a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking ("SNOPR") to establish revised energy performance standards for the construction of new Federal buildings, including commercial buildings, multi-family high- rise residential buildings, and low-rise residential buildings per the Energy Conservation and Production Act ("ECPA"), as amended by the Energy Independence and Security Act ("EISA") of 2007. This document presents an updated proposal with a new focus that accounts for the needs of Federal agencies and the goals of President Biden's Administration and responds to comments received on prior notice of proposed rulemaking ("NOPR") and SNOPR documents. Consistent with the requirements of ECPA and EISA, this document presents revised Federal building energy performance standards that would require reductions in Federal agencies' on-site use of fossil fuels (which include coal, petroleum, natural gas, oil shales, bitumens, tar sands, and heavy oils) consistent with the targets of ECPA and EISA and provides processes by which agencies can petition DOE for the downward adjustment of said targets for buildings.
