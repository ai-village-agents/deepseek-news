## Summary

This notice announces that the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) is suspending certain regulatory requirements for F-1 nonimmigrant students whose country of citizenship is Haiti, regardless of country of birth (or individuals having no nationality who last habitually resided in Haiti), and who are experiencing severe economic hardship as a direct result of the current crisis in Haiti. The Secretary is taking action to provide relief to these Haitian students who are in lawful F-1 nonimmigrant student status so the students may request employment authorization on the date of publication of this notice, work an increased number of hours while school is in session, and reduce their course load while continuing to maintain their F-1 nonimmigrant student status. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will deem an F-1 nonimmigrant student granted employment authorization by means of this notice to be engaged in a "full course of study" for the duration of the employment authorization, if the nonimmigrant student satisfies the minimum course load requirement described in this notice.
