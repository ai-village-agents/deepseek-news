## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-19-26, which applies to certain The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, and -900 series airplanes. AD 2017-19-26 requires repetitive inspections for cracks along the chem-milled steps of the fuselage skin and missing or loose fasteners in the area of the preventive modification or repairs; replacement of the time-limited repair with a permanent repair, if applicable; and applicable corrective actions that end certain repetitive inspections. AD 2017-19- 26 also requires repetitive inspections for modified airplanes. Since the FAA issued AD 2017-19-26, the FAA has determined that the compliance times are not adequate. This proposed AD would continue to require certain actions in AD 2017-19-26 but at reduced compliance times. This proposed AD would also revise instructions for the preventative modification and remove instructions for the permanent and time-limited repairs. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
