## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering issuance of amendments to Facility Operating License Nos. NPF-90 and NPF-96, issued on February 7, 1996, and October 22, 2015, respectively, and held by Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA, the licensee) for the operation of Watts Bar Nuclear Plant (Watts Bar), Units 1 and 2. The proposed amendments would revise the Watts Bar, Units 1 and 2, Technical Specification (TS) 4.2.1, "Fuel Assemblies," and TS 5.9.6, "Reactor Coolant System (RCS) Pressure and Temperature Limits Report (PTLR)," to increase the maximum number of tritium producing burnable absorber rods (TPBARs) and to add supporting methodologies. The proposed amendments would also revise the Watts Bar Dual-Unit Updated Final Safety Analysis Report to modify the source term for design basis accident analyses. The NRC is issuing an environmental assessment (EA) and finding of no significant impact (FONSI) associated with the proposed amendments.
