A supplement to the complaint was filed on January 12, 2021. The complaint alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain batteries and products containing same by reason of infringement of the sole claims of U.S. Patent No. D579,868 ("the '868 patent"); U.S. Patent No. D580,353 ("the '353 patent"); and U.S. Patent No. D593,944 ("the '944 patent").
