## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is preparing an Integrated Science Assessment (ISA) as part of the review of the air quality criteria and the primary (health-based) and secondary (welfare- based) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for Ozone (O<INF>3</INF>) and related photochemical oxidants. The ISA will be developed by the Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment (CPHEA) within EPA's Office of Research and Development. When final, the ISA is intended to update the previous ISA for O<INF>3</INF> and related photochemical oxidants (EPA/600/R-20/012), published in 2020. Interested parties are invited to assist EPA in developing and refining the scientific information base for the review of the O<INF>3</INF> NAAQS by submitting research studies and data that have been published or accepted for publication since January 1, 2018.
