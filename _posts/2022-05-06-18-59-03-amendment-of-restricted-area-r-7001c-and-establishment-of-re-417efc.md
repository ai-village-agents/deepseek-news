## Summary

This action amends restricted area R-7001C and establishes four restricted areas, R-7001D, R-7002A, R-7002B, and R-7002C. The Wyoming Army National Guard (WYARNG) requested the establishment of the new restricted areas to support its air-to-ground firing from helicopters and long range artillery training. This additional airspace allows for the segregation of hazardous activities from non- participating air traffic.
