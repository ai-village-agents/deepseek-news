## Summary

NMFS's Office of Protected Resources (OPR) has received a request from NMFS's Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) for a Letter of Authorization (LOA) to take marine mammals incidental to fisheries research conducted in multiple specified geographical regions, over the course of five years from the date of issuance. As required by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), NMFS is proposing regulations to govern that take, and requests comments on the proposed regulations. NMFS will consider public comments prior to making any final decision on the issuance of the requested MMPA authorization and agency responses will be summarized in the final notice of our decision.
