## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is soliciting information and requesting comment to assist in the development of regulatory changes pertaining to the restructuring of the Regional Haze Rule (RHR). Under the current RHR, states must submit state implementation plans (SIPs) to protect visibility in mandatory Class I Federal areas (Class I areas) to demonstrate reasonable progress towards the national visibility goal. The Agency is seeking input regarding how the EPA can meaningfully revise the RHR to streamline regulatory requirements impacting states' visibility improvement obligations under the Clean Air Act (CAA).
