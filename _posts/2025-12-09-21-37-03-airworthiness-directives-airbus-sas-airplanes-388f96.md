## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-15- 05, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2022-15-05 required repetitive high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections for cracks on the web horizontal flange and inner cap, and applicable corrective actions. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-15-05, additional cracks have been found at the door stop fitting number 1 holes at frame (FR) 68, after disassembly of the door stop fitting as part of the inspections required by AD 2022-15-05. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2022-15-05, but with reduced compliances times for some inspections, and requires an additional inspection at door stop fitting number 1. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
