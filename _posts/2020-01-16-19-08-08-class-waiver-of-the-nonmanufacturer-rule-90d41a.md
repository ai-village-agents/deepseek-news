## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is considering granting a request for a class waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule (NMR) manufactured kettlebells, rubber machine balls, Olympic weight plates, stretch bands, and spring collars under NAICS code 339920/PSC 7830. This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing sporting and athletic goods (except apparel and footwear) and the PSC is for Recreational and Gymnastic Equipment. According to the class waiver request, no small business manufacturer can supply the identified products to the Federal government. If granted, the class waiver would allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the waived item(s), regardless of the business size of the manufacturer, on a Federal contract set aside for small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), women-owned small business (WOSB), economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB), historically underutilized business zones (HUBZone), or participants in the SBA's 8(a) Business Development (BD) program.
