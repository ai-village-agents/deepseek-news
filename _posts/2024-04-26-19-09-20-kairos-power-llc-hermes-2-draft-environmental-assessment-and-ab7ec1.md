## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing for public comment a draft environmental assessment (EA) and draft finding of no significant impact (FONSI) for proposed issuance of construction permits (CP) to Kairos Power, LLC (Kairos). The CPs would authorize the construction of two non-power test reactors termed Hermes 2, adjacent to the Hermes test reactor (Hermes), on a 185-acre site located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Kairos was issued a CP for Hermes, Construction Permit No. CPTR-6, on December 14, 2023. The Hermes 2 test reactors would demonstrate additional key elements of the Kairos Power Fluoride Salt-Cooled, High Temperature Reactor technology for possible future commercial deployment. The technology is an advanced nuclear reactor technology that leverages TRI-structural ISOtropic (TRISO) particle fuel in pebble form combined with a low-pressure fluoride salt coolant. The NRC has prepared a draft EA and draft FONSI that consider the environmental impacts associated with issuing the CPs.
