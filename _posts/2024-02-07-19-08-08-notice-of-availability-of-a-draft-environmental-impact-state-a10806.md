## Summary

Pursuant to the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), GSA has prepared a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) to analyze the potential environmental effects of the proposed expansion and modernization of the existing Alcan LPOE. The Alcan LPOE is located at Milepost 1221.8 on the Alaska Highway, 0.43 miles from the U.S./Canada Border. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operates this facility year-round in sub-arctic weather conditions. The Alcan LPOE is the only 24-hour port serving privately-owned vehicles (POVs) and commercial traffic between the Yukon Territory, Canada, and mainland Alaska. GSA proposes to build an expanded and modernized LPOE and new housing units at Alcan, Alaska, to replace the existing facilities. The DEIS describes the purpose and need for the proposed project, the alternatives considered, the existing environment that could be affected, the potential impacts resulting from each of the alternatives, and proposed best management practices and mitigation measures.
