## Summary

This document requests comments on a petition for rule making filed by Shamrock Communications, Inc., proposing to amend the FM Table of Allotments, by substituting Channel 256A for vacant Channel 288A at Tecopa, California to accommodate the hybrid modification application for Station KRZQ(FM) that proposes to upgrade from Channel 290C1 to Channel 291C at Amargosa Valley, Nevada. A staff engineering analysis indicates that Channel 256A can be allotted to Tecopa, California, consistent with the minimum distance separation requirements of the Commission's rules, with a site restriction of 2.3 km (1.4 miles) northwest of the community. The reference coordinates are 35-50-48 NL and 116-13-27 WL.
