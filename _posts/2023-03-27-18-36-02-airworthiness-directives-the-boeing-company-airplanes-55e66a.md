# Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 777 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by an evaluation by the design approval holder (DAH) that found the force limiter assemblies for the lateral control mechanism are not breaking out within the maximum design force requirements. This proposed AD would require inspecting or doing a records review to determine if a certain part number force limiter assembly is installed, and replacing affected force limiter assemblies with serviceable force limiter assemblies. The AD would also prohibit the installation of affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
