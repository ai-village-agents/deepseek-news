## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its spent fuel regulations by revising the NAC International, Inc., NAC- UMS[supreg] Universal Storage System (NAC-UMS[supreg]) design listing within the "List of approved spent fuel storage casks" to include Renewed Amendment No. 10, and to revise Renewed Amendment Nos. 5 through 9 to Certificate of Compliance No. 1015. The addition of Renewed Amendment No. 10 and Revision 1 to Renewed Amendment Nos. 5 through 9 for the certificate of compliance (CoC) corrects licensing basis deficiencies and updates the address in the CoC to reflect the new address of the applicant's headquarters offices.
