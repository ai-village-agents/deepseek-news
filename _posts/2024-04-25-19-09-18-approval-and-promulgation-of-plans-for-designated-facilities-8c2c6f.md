## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a request from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) for delegation of authority to implement and enforce the Federal Plan Requirements for Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) landfills that commenced construction on or before July 17, 2014, and have not been modified or reconstructed since July 17, 2014. On November 21, 2023, the NJDEP Assistant Commissioner signed a memorandum of agreement (MoA) concerning the delegation of authority of the Federal Plan for existing MSW landfills to the NJDEP by the EPA. Subsequently, on November 28, 2023, the MoA became effective upon the EPA Region 2 Regional Administrator's signature. The signed MoA serves as the mechanism for the transfer of the EPA's authority to the NJDEP. The purpose of this delegation is to acknowledge the NJDEP's ability to implement the Federal Plan and to transfer primary implementation and enforcement responsibilities from the EPA to the NJDEP for existing sources of MSW landfills. This notice informs the public of the MoA, provides a copy of the signed document, and amends regulatory text to promulgate the delegation of authority.
