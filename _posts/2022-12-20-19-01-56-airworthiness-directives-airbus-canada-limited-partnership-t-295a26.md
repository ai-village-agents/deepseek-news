## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that the nose radome lightning diverter strips on certain aircraft were painted in production; paint on the diverter strips can compromise the nose radome lightning protection. This proposed AD would require inspecting for paint on the diverter strips on the nose radome, and replacing the nose radome if necessary, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
