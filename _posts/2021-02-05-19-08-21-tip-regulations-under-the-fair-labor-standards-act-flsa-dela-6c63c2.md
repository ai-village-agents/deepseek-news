## Summary

In accordance with the Presidential directive as expressed in the memorandum of January 20, 2021 from the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff, entitled "Regulatory Freeze Pending Review," this action proposes to delay until April 30, 2021 the effective date of the rule entitled Tip Regulations Under the Fair Labor Standards Act ("Tip Rule"), published in the Federal Register on December 30, 2020. The rule's current effective date is March 1, 2021. WHD seeks comments on this proposed delay, which would allow the Wage and Hour Division additional opportunity for review and consideration of the new rule.
