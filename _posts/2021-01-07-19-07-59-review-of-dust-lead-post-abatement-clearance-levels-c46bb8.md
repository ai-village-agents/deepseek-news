## Summary

Reducing childhood lead exposure is a priority for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). As part of EPA's efforts to reduce childhood lead exposure, and in coordination with the President's Task Force on Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children, EPA reevaluated the 2001 dust-lead clearance levels (DLCL). Clearance levels indicate the amount of lead in dust on a surface following the completion of an abatement activity. Surface dust is collected via dust wipe samples that are sent to a laboratory for analysis to determine whether clearance has been achieved. The post- abatement dust-lead levels are evaluated against, and must be below, the applicable clearance levels. The DLCL have not changed since they were issued in 2001. EPA is finalizing its proposal to lower the DLCL from 40 micrograms of per square foot ([mu]g/ft\2\) to 10 [mu]g/ft\2\ for floors, and from 250 [mu]g/ft\2\ to 100 [mu]g/ft\2\ for window sills.
