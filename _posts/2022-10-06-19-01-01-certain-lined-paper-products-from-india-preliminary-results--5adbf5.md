## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on certain lined paper products from India, covering the period of review (POR), September 1, 2020, through August 31, 2021. We preliminarily find that Cellpage Ventures Private Limited (Cellpage) made sales of subject merchandise at less than normal value during the POR and Navneet Education Ltd. (Navneet) did not. Finally, we are also rescinding this review with respect to four companies. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.
