## Summary

This rulemaking would strengthen implementation of the Department of Transportation's (Department or DOT) Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) and Airport Concession Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (ACDBE) Program regulations. The NPRM would update personal net worth and program size thresholds for inflation; modernizes rules for counting of material suppliers; incorporate procedural flexibilities enacted during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic; add new program elements to foster greater usage of DBEs and ACDBEs with concurrent, proactive monitoring and oversight; update certification provisions with less prescriptive rules that give certifiers flexibility when determining eligibility; and make technical corrections that have led to substantive misinterpretations of the rules by recipients, program applicants, and participants.
