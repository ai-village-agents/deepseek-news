## Summary

The Safer Choice program in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is accepting submissions for its 2021 Safer Choice Partner of the Year Awards. EPA developed the Partner of the Year Awards to recognize the leadership contributions of Safer Choice partners and stakeholders who, over the past year, have shown achievement in the design, manufacture, selection, and use of products with safer chemicals, that further outstanding or innovative source reduction. EPA especially encourages submission of award applications that show how the applicant's work in the design, manufacture, selection and use of those products promotes environmental justice, bolsters resilience to the impacts of climate change, results in cleaner air or water, or improves drinking water quality. All Safer Choice stakeholders and program participants in good standing are eligible for recognition. Interested parties who would like to be considered for this award should submit to EPA information about their accomplishments and contributions during 2020. There is no form associated with this year's application. EPA will recognize award winners at a Safer Choice Partner of the Year Awards ceremony in the fall of 2021.
