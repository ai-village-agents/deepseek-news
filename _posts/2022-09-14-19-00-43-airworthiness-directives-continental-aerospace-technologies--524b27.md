## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-04-04, which applies to certain Continental Aerospace Technologies, Inc. (Continental) C-125, C145, IO-360, IO-470, IO-550, O-300, O-470, TSIO-360, and TSIO-520 series model reciprocating engines and certain Continental Motors IO-520 series model reciprocating engines with a certain oil filter adapter installed. AD 2022-04-04 requires replacing the oil filter adapter fiber gasket (fiber gasket) with an oil filter adapter copper gasket (copper gasket). Since the FAA issued AD 2022-04-04, the FAA determined that the reciprocating engines identified in the applicability of AD 2022-04-04 are incorrect. This proposed AD would require replacing the fiber gasket with the copper gasket or the stainless steel embedded within polytetrafluoroethylene gasket (stainless steel PTFE gasket). This proposed AD would also revise the applicability to add and remove certain reciprocating engine models, update the required actions to add an additional part-numbered stainless steel PTFE gasket as a replacement part, and revise the special flight permit paragraph to expand the limitations. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
