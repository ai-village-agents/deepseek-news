Skye Williams under the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), assigned to Joint Task Force-Southern Border (JTF-SB) conducts pushups during a Expert Physical Fitness Assessment (EPFA) in Fort Huachuca, Ariz., on Feb. 17, 2026. Events like the EPFA increase soldier readiness for both Expert Soldier Badge testing as well as conducting operations on the Southern Border. JTF‑SB executes full‑scale, agile, and all‑domain operations in support of U.S. Customs and Border Protection to protect the territorial integrity of the United States and achieve 100% operational control of the southern border.
