## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is modifying the systems of records listed in this notice to incorporate one routine use related to the disclosure of records to the U.S. Department of the Treasury pursuant to the Office of Management and Budget's Memorandum 25-32. The new routine use permits disclosures of records to the U.S. Department of the Treasury when the information is relevant to review payment and award eligibility through the Do Not Pay Working System for the purposes of identifying, preventing, or recouping improper payments to an applicant for, or recipient of, Federal funds. For full descriptions of the systems of records, please see the chart below for a list of the System of Records Notices (SORNs) and their corresponding Federal Register citations.
