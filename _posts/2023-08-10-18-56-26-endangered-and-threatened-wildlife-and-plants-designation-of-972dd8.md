## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to designate critical habitat for the Sacramento Mountains checkerspot butterfly (Euphydryas anicia cloudcrofti), a butterfly from New Mexico, under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). In total, approximately 1,636.9 acres (662.4 hectares) in Otero County, New Mexico, fall within the boundaries of the proposed critical habitat designation. We also announce the availability of a draft economic analysis of the proposed designation of critical habitat for the Sacramento Mountains checkerspot butterfly.
