## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model EC 155B and EC155B1 helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of mechanical deformation of the protective cover of the "SHEAR" control pushbutton on the copilot collective stick. This AD requires replacement of the protective cover of the "SHEAR" control pushbutton on the pilot and copilot collective sticks and re- identification of the pilot and copilot collective sticks, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
