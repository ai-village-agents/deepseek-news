## Summary

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces additional findings for the noise compatibility program submitted by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for EWR, see SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION for details. On January 15, 2019, the FAA determined that the noise exposure maps submitted for EWR were in compliance with applicable requirements. On August 19, 2022, the FAA determined that the noise compatibility program submitted for EWR would be initiating final review for approval or disapproval. On February 15, 2023, the FAA approved the EWR noise compatibility program with the issuance of a Record of Approval. The noise compatibility program contained 28 recommended measures, including 13 noise abatement measures, three land use measures, and 12 program management measures. Of the measures proposed, 15 were approved, two were approved as voluntary, two were partially approved as voluntary and partially disapproved, five were disapproved, and one was determined to have no FAA action as continuations of existing mandatory practices at EWR. Three measures contained in the noise compatibility program were noise abatement procedures that required additional consultation with the FAA Air Traffic Organization. Additionally, following issuance of the Record of Approval on February 15, 2023, the Port Authority requested that the FAA revisit the decision for Noise Abatement Measure 6, indicating that the rationale for disapproval originally provided contained an error. On August 14, 2023, the FAA issued a Supplemental Record of Approval for the EWR noise compatibility program regarding these four noise abatement measures. The Supplemental Record of Approval disapproves the three measures upon which No Action was taken with the February 15, 2023 Record of Approval and revises the decision on Noise Abatement Measure 6 from disapproved to approved.
