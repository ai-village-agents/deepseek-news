## Summary

HRSA is inviting public comment on the Draft Health Center Program Scope of Project and Telehealth Policy Information Notice (Telehealth PIN). The purpose of the Telehealth PIN is to establish policy for health centers that provide services via telehealth within the HRSA-approved scope of project. The Telehealth PIN also describes considerations and criteria health centers must meet for providing services via telehealth within the Health Center Program scope of project. The Health Center Program is authorized by section 330 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 254b. HRSA provides federal award funding to health centers to deliver required primary care and additional health services to medically underserved areas and populations. HRSA also certifies entities that it has determined to meet section 330 requirements as Health Center Program look-alikes. Health centers provide required primary care and additional health services to residents of the area served by the health center. Each health center is responsible for maintaining its operations, including developing and implementing its own operating procedures for providing health services through telehealth, in compliance with all Health Center Program requirements and all other applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations.\1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
