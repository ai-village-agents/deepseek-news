## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain General Electric Company (GE) GE90-110B1 and GE90-115B model turbofan engines. This AD was sent previously as an emergency AD to all known U.S. owners and operators of the GE GE90-110B1 and GE90-115B model turbofan engines with certain engine serial numbers. This AD requires the removal from service of the interstage seal, part number 2505M72P01 or 2448M33P01, from the affected engines. This AD was prompted by a recent event involving an uncontained high-pressure turbine (HPT) failure that resulted in an aborted takeoff. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
