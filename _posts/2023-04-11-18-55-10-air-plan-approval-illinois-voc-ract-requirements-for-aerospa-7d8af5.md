## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving State Implementation Plan (SIP) rule revisions submitted by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA or Illinois) on April 13, 2021, and supplemented by a Clean Air Act (CAA) section 110(l) demonstration submitted on October 6, 2022. Illinois requests that EPA approve rule revisions related to control of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from aerospace manufacturing and rework facilities into Illinois' SIP. These rule revisions are consistent with the Control Techniques Guidelines (CTG) for Aerospace Manufacturing and Rework Operations published by EPA in 1997, generally used to meet Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) requirements, and serve as SIP strengthening measures for aerospace facilities located in the Illinois portion of the St. Louis nonattainment area (Metro-East area). The Metro-East area consists of Madison, Monroe, and St. Clair counties in Illinois. EPA proposed to approve this action on January 10, 2023, and received no adverse comments.
