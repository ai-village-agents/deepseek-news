## Summary

The United States (U.S.) General Services Administration (GSA) is proposing to amend the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) by implementing a third methodology for reimbursing temporary quarters subsistence expenses (TQSE) allowance and redefining the current methods of reimbursing TQSE to include, among others, lowering the percentage multipliers for calculating TQSE maximum daily amounts. The proposed rule would clarify that TQSE percentage multipliers cannot be adjusted for househunting days. The proposed rule also lists an exception to the "reasonable proximity" requirement for temporary quarters (TQ) located in a Presidentially-Declared Disaster area and allows agencies to authorize TQSE at the applicable locality per diem allowance or authorize actual expenses on an individual basis for TQ located in a Presidentially-Declared Disaster area. Instead of authorizing actual expenses on an individual basis, agencies can issue a blanket actual expense authorization for employees authorized to occupy TQ in Presidentially-Declared Disaster areas. The proposed rule would also update and clarify some TQSE sections and rearrange them into a more sequential order.
