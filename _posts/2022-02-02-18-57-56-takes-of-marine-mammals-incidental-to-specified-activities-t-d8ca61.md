## Summary

NMFS has received a request from the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities (ADOT) for an Incidental Harassment Authorization (IHA) to take marine mammals incidental to the construction of four ferry berth facilities in Tongass Narrows in Ketchikan, Alaska: The Gravina Airport Ferry Layup Facility, the Gravina Freight Facility, the Revilla New Ferry Berth, and the Gravina Island Shuttle Ferry Berth Facility. Pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), NMFS is requesting comments on its proposal to issue an IHA to incidentally take marine mammals during the specified activities. NMFS is also requesting comments on a possible one-time, one-year renewal that could be issued under certain circumstances and if all requirements are met, as described in Request for Public Comments at the end of this notice. NMFS will consider public comments prior to making any final decision on the issuance of the requested MMPA authorizations and agency responses will be summarized in the final notice of our decision.
