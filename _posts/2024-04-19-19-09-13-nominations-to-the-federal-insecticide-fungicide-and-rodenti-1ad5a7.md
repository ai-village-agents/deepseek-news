## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) is now accepting public comments on the experts the Agency is considering for membership on the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP). This document identifies the individuals nominated. The Agency anticipates selecting from those nominees that are identified as interested and available to appoint up to four new SAP members by July 2024 due to expiring membership terms. Current members of the SAP are eligible for reappointment during this period. Therefore, the appointments anticipated to be completed by July may include a mix of newly appointed and reappointed members. Public comments on these nominations will be used to assist the Agency in selecting the new members for the FIFRA SAP.
