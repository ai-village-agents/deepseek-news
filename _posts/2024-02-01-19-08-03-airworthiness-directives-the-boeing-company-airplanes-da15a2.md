## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 777 airplanes. This AD was prompted by an evaluation by the design approval holder (DAH) that found the force limiter assemblies for the lateral control mechanism are not breaking out within the maximum design force requirements. This AD requires replacing affected force limiter assemblies and prohibits the installation of affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
