## Summary

We, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), announce revisions to our December 9, 2014, proposed designation of critical habitat for the Arctic subspecies of the ringed seal (Pusa hispida hispida) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The revised proposed designation comprises an area of marine habitat in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas. Based on consideration of national security impacts, we also propose to exclude a particular area north of the Beaufort Sea shelf from the designation. We seek comments on all aspects of the revised proposed critical habitat designation and will consider information received before issuing a final designation.
