## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-26- 13, which applied to certain Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (Sikorsky) Model S-92A helicopters. AD 2020-26-13 required establishing the life limit for certain part-numbered horizontal stabilizer root fittings FWD (forward root fittings) and certain part-numbered stabilizer strut fittings. AD 2020-26-13 also required repetitively inspecting certain parts, and depending on the inspection results, removing parts from service. Finally AD 2020-26-13 prohibited installing certain stabilizer assemblies on any helicopter. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-26-13, the manufacturer notified the FAA that due to an error in the service information, certain part numbers in AD 2020-26-13 are incorrect. Also, the FAA determined that additional inspections are required to address the unsafe condition. This AD retains certain requirements and the prohibition for installing certain stabilizer assemblies on any helicopter from AD 2020-26-13, corrects certain part numbers, and requires additional repetitive inspections. The actions of this AD are intended to address an unsafe condition on these products.
