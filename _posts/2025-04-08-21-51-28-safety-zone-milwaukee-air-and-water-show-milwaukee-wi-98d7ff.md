## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to amend a published safety zone for certain waters of Lake Michigan encompassing the Milwaukee Air and Water Show to include an additional day. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters in the vicinity of McKinley Park and Bradford Beach, during this recurring event on the third weekend in July. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Sector Lake Michigan or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
