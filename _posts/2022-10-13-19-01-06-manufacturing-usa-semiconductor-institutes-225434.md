## Summary

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is seeking public input to inform the design of, and requirements for, potential Manufacturing USA institutes to strengthen the semiconductor and microelectronics innovation ecosystem, which could include design, fabrication, advanced test, assembly, and packaging capability. These Manufacturing USA institutes are envisioned in Title XCIX of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) for America) to support efforts in research and development as well as education and workforce development, and that Act also provides for complementary initiatives including the National Semiconductor Technology Center, the National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program, and the NIST laboratories program supporting measurement science and standards. Responses to this Request for Information (RFI) will inform NIST's development of funding opportunities for federal assistance to establish Manufacturing USA semiconductor institutes.
