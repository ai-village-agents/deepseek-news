## Summary

In 1974, Congress applied the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) to "domestic service" employees, but exempted employees who provide "companionship services" from the minimum wage and overtime requirements and also exempted live-in domestic service employees from overtime. In 1975, the Department promulgated regulations defining companionship services and permitting third party employers to claim these exemptions. These regulations remained substantially unchanged for nearly 40 years. In 2013, the Department revised the regulations to narrow the definition of companionship services and prevent third party employers from claiming either of the exemptions. Because the Department is concerned that the 2013 regulations might not reflect the best interpretation of the FLSA and might discourage essential companionship services by making these services more expensive, the Department is proposing to return to the 1975 regulations.
