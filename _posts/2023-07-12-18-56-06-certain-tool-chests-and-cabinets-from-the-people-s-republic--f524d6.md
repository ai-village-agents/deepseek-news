## Summary

As a result of the determinations by the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) orders on certain tool chests and cabinets (tool chests and cabinets) from the People's Republic of China (China) and from the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (Vietnam), and the countervailing duty (CVD) order on tool chests and cabinets from China would likely lead to the continuation or recurrence of dumping, and countervailable subsidies, and material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation of these AD and CVD orders.
