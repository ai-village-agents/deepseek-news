## Summary

The United States Postal Service[supreg] (USPS) is proposing to revise one General Privacy Act System of Records (SOR). These modifications are being proposed to support an initiative to streamline the employee lead generation entry process for leads submitted by USPS employees on behalf of business customers that request to speak with a USPS Sales Representative about Postal products and services. Employee leads generate potential opportunities for new revenue for the Postal Service. Streamlining and simplifying the entry process for the employee lead generation program will enhance the employee's ability to meet customer needs, improve responsiveness and encourage additional employees to participate in the LEADing Together program, or similar programs.
