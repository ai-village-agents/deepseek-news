## Summary

This final rule will improve the electronic exchange of health care data and streamline processes related to prior authorization through new requirements for Medicare Advantage (MA) organizations, state Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) programs, state Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) FFS programs, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and Qualified Health Plan (QHP) issuers on the Federally-facilitated Exchanges (FFEs). This final rule will also add new measures for eligible hospitals and critical access hospitals (CAHs) to report under the Medicare Promoting Interoperability Program and for MIPS eligible clinicians to report under the Promoting Interoperability performance category of the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS). These policies, taken together, will reduce overall payer and provider burden and improve patient access to health information while continuing CMS's drive toward interoperability in the health care market.
