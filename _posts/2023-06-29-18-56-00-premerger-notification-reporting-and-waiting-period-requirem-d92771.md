# Premerger Notification; Reporting and Waiting Period Requirements

## Summary

Pursuant to Section 7A(d) of the Clayton Act, the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC" or "Commission") is proposing amendments to the premerger notification rules ("the Rules") that implement the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act ("the Act" or "HSR") and to the Premerger Notification and Report Form (the "Form") and Instructions ("Instructions"). These proposed changes would result in a redesign of the premerger notification process through both a reorganization of the information currently required and the addition of new information and document requirements. In addition, these changes would implement the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022. The proposed amendments would involve changes to both the Rules and the Instructions, and the Commission proposes explanatory and ministerial changes to the Rules as well as necessary amendments to the Instructions to effect the proposed changes.
