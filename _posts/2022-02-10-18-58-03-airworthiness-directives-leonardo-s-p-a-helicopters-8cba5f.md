## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Leonardo S.p.a. Model AB139 and AW139 helicopters. This AD was prompted by the identification of certain parts needing maintenance actions, including life limits and maintenance tasks. This AD requires incorporating into maintenance records requirements (airworthiness limitations), as specified in a European Aviation Safety Agency (now European Union Aviation Safety Agency) (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
