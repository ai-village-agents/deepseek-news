## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for an information collection to support the analysis of safety data as part of the Safety Management System Voluntary Program (SMSVP). The data collected will be used by the FAA Flight Standards Service, Safety Management System Program Office (SMSPO) to evaluate certificate holders participating in the voluntary program. This Information Collection will enable the FAA to ensure conformity with the SMSVP Standard (voluntary program guidelines and performance measures).
