## Summary

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), as part of its obligations under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), invites the general public and other Federal agencies to take this opportunity to comment on a proposed information collection, a Survey of the Costs of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) Compliance. The instrument for the information collection is a survey. The survey seeks to gather information on the direct compliance costs incurred by FDIC-supervised insured depository institutions and, to the extent these expenses overlap with those of other activities (such as fraud and credit card monitoring), the amount attributable to AML/CFT compliance. The FDIC is seeking a new OMB Control Number for this information collection. The FDIC expects to submit this information collection as a common form so that the Federal banking regulators and the National Credit Union Association may use the information collection to survey the entirety of the banking and credit union industry. On September 12, 2025, the FDIC requested public comment for 60 days on the proposed information collection. The comment period for the September notice expired on November 12, 2025. As described in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section of this document, the FDIC will proceed with the information collection as proposed.
