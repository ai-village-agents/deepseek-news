## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain ATR--GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42-500 and ATR72-212A airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of the possible use of improper material during the manufacturing of vertical stabilizer to horizontal stabilizer junction fittings. This AD requires inspections of affected parts, applicable repairs, and eventual replacement of certain affected parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
