## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to add two events to the table regarding "Southern California Annual Firework Events for the Los Angeles Long Beach Captain of the Port zone." The proposed additions are temporary safety zones, one for the Marina Del Rey annual Boat Parade fireworks show and another for the Marina Del Rey New Year's Eve fireworks display. Entry into these safety zones would be prohibited during the annual events to provide for the safety of the waterway users and to keep them clear of potential harmful debris within the fallout zone.
