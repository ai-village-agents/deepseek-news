# Airworthiness Directives; Embraer S.A. (Type Certificate Previously Held by Yaborã Indústria Aeronáutica S.A.; Embraer S.A.) Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Embraer S.A. Model ERJ 190-100 STD, -100 LR, -100 ECJ, -100 IGW, -200 STD, -200 LR, and -200 IGW airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of uncommanded setting of the barometric reference in both primary flight displays (PFDs) due to the architecture of data communication of the Control I/O modules, which interconnect the display controllers to the air data system. This proposed AD would require installing updated Primus EPIC software, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
