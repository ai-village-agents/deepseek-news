## Summary

The General Services Administration (GSA) is issuing a direct final rule amending the General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation (GSAR) to redesignate the terminology for unique identification of entities receiving GSA awards. The change to the GSAR eliminates references to the proprietary Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS[supreg]) number and conforms to similar changes in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).
