## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Baykar Piaggio Aerospace S.p.A. (type certificate previously held by Piaggio Aviation S.p.A.) (Piaggio) Model P-180 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of corrosion and cracks affecting the vertical stabilizer. This proposed AD would require repetitive visual and non-destructive testing (NDT) inspections, a one-time NDT inspection of the vertical stabilizer assembly, and, depending on findings, accomplishment of corrective actions. In addition, this AD would provide a terminating action for the repetitive inspections. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
