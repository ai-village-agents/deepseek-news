## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA), Office of Human Resources is giving notice that it proposes to create a new system of records pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. The Talent Enterprise Diagnostic (TED) system is being created to establish a new tool within Sharepoint, the Agency's existing Microsoft O365 web-based document management and storage system. TED provides for the collection of information to track, update, and assess the skills of positions throughout EPA along with the corresponding skills of incumbents in those positions. TED supports the Agency's efforts to: (1) Develop policies and programs that are based on comprehensive workforce planning and analysis; and (2) meet requirements under 5 CFR 250, such as monitoring and addressing government-wide and Agency- specific skill gaps in mission-critical occupations. The system information will be accessed and used by EPA's supervisors, designated human resources specialists and analysts, managers within each office and region, Agency-wide senior leaders, and the Agency's training branch. TED provides for the collection of information to track, update, and assess the skills of positions throughout EPA along with the corresponding skills of incumbents in those positions.
