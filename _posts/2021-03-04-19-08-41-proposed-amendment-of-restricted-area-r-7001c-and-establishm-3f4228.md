## Summary

This action proposes to amend restricted area R-7001C and establish three restricted areas, R-7001D, R-7002A, R-7002B, and R- 7002C at Guernsey, WY. The Wyoming Army National Guard (WYARNG) requested the establishment of the new restricted areas to support its air-to-ground firing from helicopters and longer range artillery training. This additional airspace allows for the segregation of hazardous activities from non-participating air traffic. The FAA is also proposing to amend R-7001C to correct an inadvertent error to ensure proper vertical separation.
