## Summary

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is soliciting nominations from qualified organizations to be considered for non-voting liaison representative positions on a subcommittee of the Advisory Committee for Women's Services (ACWS) focused on maternal mental health. The ACWS subcommittee will consist of 5 non-voting liaison representatives who are nominated by their organizations to serve as the representatives of their organizations and selected by the ACWS DFO. The ACWS's role is to advise the Associate Administrator for Women's Services (AAWS) on appropriate activities to be undertaken by the agencies of the Administration with respect to women's substance use and mental health services, including services which require a multidisciplinary approach. These may include discussion on the development of policies and programs regarding women's issues; plans to standardize and enhance the collection of data on women's health, and other emerging issues concerning women's substance use and mental health services. In particular, this subcommittee will focus on maternal mental health issues (which includes substance use) including prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, equity and community-based interventions.
