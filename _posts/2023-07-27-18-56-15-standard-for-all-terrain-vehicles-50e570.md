## Summary

The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA) required the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or the Commission) to publish, as a mandatory consumer product safety standard, the American National Standard for Four-Wheel All-Terrain Vehicles Equipment Configuration, and Performance Requirements developed by the Specialty Vehicle Institute of America (ANSI/SVIA 1- 2007). CPSC published that mandatory consumer product safety standard on November 14, 2008. Since then, the Commission has revised this mandatory standard twice in accordance with the revision procedures set out in the CPSIA. ANSI/SVIA has again revised its standard. In accordance with CPSIA, CPSC proposes to amend the Commission's mandatory ATV standard to reference the 2023 edition of the ANSI/SVIA standard.
