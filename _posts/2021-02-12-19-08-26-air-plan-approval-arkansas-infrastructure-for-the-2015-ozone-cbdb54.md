## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving elements of a State Implementation Plan (SIP) submission from the State of Arkansas (State) for the 2015 Ozone (O<INF>3</INF>) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The State's submission addresses structural SIP requirements for implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of the 2015 O<INF>3</INF> NAAQS (infrastructure SIP or i-SIP). The i-SIP ensures that the Arkansas SIP is adequate to meet the State's responsibilities under the CAA for this NAAQS. We are also approving changes to certain existing State regulations to make them consistent with requirements for the 2015 O<INF>3</INF> NAAQS.
