## Summary

NMFS implements an accountability measure (AM) for the recreational harvest of snowy grouper in South Atlantic Federal waters. NMFS reduces the length of the 2025 recreational fishing season to prevent landings from exceeding the recreational annual catch limit (ACL) as they did in 2024. Accordingly, NMFS announces the adjusted closure date in 2025 for the recreational harvest of snowy grouper in South Atlantic Federal waters to protect the snowy grouper resource.
