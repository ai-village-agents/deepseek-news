## Summary

The Coast Guard is seeking information and comments during a test schedule for the bridges crossing the Milwaukee, Menomonee, Kinnickinnic River, South Menomonee River, and Burnham Canals. The city of Milwaukee requested the regulations to be reviewed and updated to allow for a more balanced flow of maritime and land based transportation. The current regulation has been in place for over 30 years and is obsolete. This deviation will test a change to the drawbridge operation schedule to determine whether a permanent change to the schedule is needed. The Coast Guard is seeking comments from the public regarding these proposed changes.
