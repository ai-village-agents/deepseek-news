## Summary

The United States Grain Standards Act (USGSA) designations of the official agencies listed in SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION below will end on the prescribed dates. The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is seeking persons or governmental agencies interested in providing official services in the areas presently served by these agencies to submit an application for designation. Designation provides for private entities or state governmental agencies to be an integral part of the official grain inspection system. Designated agencies work under the supervision of AMS's Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) and are authorized to provide official inspection and weighing services in a defined geographical area. In addition, we request comments on the quality of services provided by the following designated agencies: Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries (Alabama); Kankakee Grain Inspection, Inc. (Kankakee); Missouri Department of Agriculture (Missouri); Hastings Grain Inspection, Inc. (Hastings); Aberdeen Grain Inspection, Inc. (Aberdeen); and Washington Department of Agriculture (Washington). AMS encourages submissions from traditionally underrepresented individuals, organizations, and businesses to reflect the diversity of this industry. AMS encourages submissions from qualified applicants, regardless of race, color, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, religion, disability status, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law.
