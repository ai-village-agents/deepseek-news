The Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education proposes priorities, requirements, definitions, and selection criteria for the Native American Language (NAL@ED) program, Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) number 84.415B. We may use one or more of these priorities, requirements, definitions, and selection criteria for competitions in fiscal year (FY) 2020 and later years.
