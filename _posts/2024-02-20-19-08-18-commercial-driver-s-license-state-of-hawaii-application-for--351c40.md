## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to grant an exemption to the State of Hawaii allowing the State to waive specific portions of the commercial driver's license (CDL) skills test for CDL applicants who take the skills test on the islands of Lanai and Molokai and issue these drivers a restricted CDL. The Agency grants this exemption because the islands of Lanai and Molokai do not have the highway infrastructure to support a demonstration of certain on-road safe driving skills required by the CDL skills test requirements. FMCSA concludes that granting the exemption, subject to the terms and conditions set forth below is likely to maintain a level of safety equivalent to or greater than the level of safety that would be maintained absent the exemption.
