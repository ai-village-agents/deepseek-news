## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all MHI RJ Aviation ULC Model CL-600-2B19 (Regional Jet Series 100 & 440) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of an oxygen-fed ground fire event potentially caused by electrical arcing from a faulty surround light wire on the third crew member's (observer) oxygen mask. This proposed AD would require an inspection for discrepancies of the observer's oxygen mask stowage box and storage compartment, oxygen hose connections and routing, and the associated electrical harness, and corrective actions if necessary; and modifying the oxygen mask flexible lamp harness, mounting plate, and compartment panel, including rerouting the electrical harness and applying protective sealant. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
