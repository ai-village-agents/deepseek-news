## Summary

With the issuance of this final rule, the Drug Enforcement Administration removes fenfluramine (chemical name: N-ethyl-[alpha]- methyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenethylamine), including its salts, isomers, and salts of isomers whenever the existence of such salts, isomers, and salts is possible, from the schedules of the Controlled Substances Act. Prior to the effective date of this rule, fenfluramine was a schedule IV controlled substance. This action removes the regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions applicable to controlled substances, including those specific to schedule IV controlled substances, on persons who handle (manufacture, distribute, reverse distribute, dispense, engage in research, import, export, conduct instructional activities or chemical analysis with, or possess) or propose to handle fenfluramine.
