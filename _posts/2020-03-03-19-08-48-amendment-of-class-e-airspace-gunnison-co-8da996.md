## Summary

This action amends Class E airspace at Gunnison-Crested Butte Regional Airport, Gunnison, CO. The action increases the circular radius of the Class E airspace designated as a surface area and adds an extension to the west of the airport. Also, this action amends the Class E airspace by adding an airspace area, designated as an extension to a Class D or Class E surface area, to the southwest of the airport. Additionally, this action amends the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface by significantly reducing the area around the airport, except to the west and southwest of the airport. Furthermore, this action amends the Class E airspace extending upward from 1,200 feet above the surface by removing this area. This area is wholly contained within the Denver Class E6 en route airspace area and duplication is not necessary. Lastly, this action makes several administrative corrections to the airspace legal descriptions for the airport.
