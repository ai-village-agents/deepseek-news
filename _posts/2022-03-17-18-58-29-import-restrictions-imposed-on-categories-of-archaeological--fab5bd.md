## Summary

This document amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regulations to reflect the imposition of import restrictions on certain categories of archaeological and ethnological material from the Federal Republic of Nigeria ("Nigeria"). These restrictions are being imposed pursuant to an agreement between the United States and Nigeria that has been entered into under the authority of the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act. This document amends the CBP regulations by adding Nigeria to the list of countries which have a bilateral agreement with the United States that imposes cultural property import restrictions. This document also contains the Designated List that describes the types of archaeological and ethnological material to which the restrictions apply.
