## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing temporary security zones in the navigable waters of the San Francisco Bay, and the Pacific Ocean within the San Francisco Captain of the Port (COTP) zone. The security zones are along San Francisco Pier 15/17, approximately 1,000 yards from shore, and the Legion of Honor, approximately 450 yards from shore. The security zones are necessary to protect the harbors, ports, and waterfront facilities during a visit from high-ranking government officials and members of the official party. Entry of vessels or persons into these zones is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port San Francisco or a designated representative.
