## Summary

NMFS proposes revised specifications for the 2021 Atlantic spiny dogfish fishery based on the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council's updated risk policy, and projected status quo specifications for fishing year 2022, as recommended by the Mid-Atlantic and New England Fishery Management Councils. This action is necessary to establish allowable harvest levels to prevent overfishing while enabling optimum yield, using the best information available. This rule also informs the public of the proposed fishery specifications and provides an opportunity for comment.
