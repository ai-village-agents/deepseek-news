## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-26-11, which applies to all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd. & Co. KG (RRD) Model RB211-Trent 875-17, 877-17, 884-17, 884B-17, 892-17, 892B- 17, and 895-17 engines. AD 2021-26-11 requires replacing the affected fuel pump on at least one affected engine. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-26-11, the FAA has determined that replacing all affected fuel pumps on all installed engines is necessary to address the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would require replacing the affected fuel pump on at least one engine before further flight and replacing all affected fuel pumps within a specified compliance time, and would also prohibit installing any affected engine onto any airplane or any affected fuel pump onto any engine, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
