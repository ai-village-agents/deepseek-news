## Summary

NMFS announces its intent to conduct a 5-year review of the endangered North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica). NMFS is required by the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to conduct 5-year reviews to ensure that listing classifications of species are accurate. The 5- year review must be based on the best scientific and commercial data available at the time of the review. We request submission of any such information on the North Pacific right whale, particularly information on its status, threats, and recovery that has become available since the previous 5-year review was issued in December 2017.
