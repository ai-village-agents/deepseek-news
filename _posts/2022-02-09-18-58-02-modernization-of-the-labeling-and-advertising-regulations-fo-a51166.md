## Summary

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) is amending certain of its regulations governing the labeling and advertising of distilled spirits and malt beverages to address comments it received in response to a notice of proposed rulemaking, Notice No. 176, published on November 26, 2018. On April 2, 2020, TTB finalized certain labeling amendments arising out of that proposed rule. This document finalizes the reorganization of, and addresses the remaining issues related to, the labeling of distilled spirits and malt beverages. Reorganizing the wine labeling regulations, and addressing the remaining labeling issues related to wine, as well as reorganizing and finalizing the regulations related to the advertising of wine, distilled spirits, and malt beverages, will be accomplished in future rulemaking. The regulatory amendments in this document will not require industry members to make changes to alcohol beverage labels or advertisements but instead provide additional flexibility to make certain changes going forward.
