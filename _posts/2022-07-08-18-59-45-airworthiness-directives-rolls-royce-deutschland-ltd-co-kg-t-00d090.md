## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-15-01 for all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Trent XWB-75, Trent XWB-79, Trent XWB-79B, Trent XWB-84, and Trent XWB-97 model turbofan engines. AD 2021-15-01 required revisions to the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the Rolls-Royce (RR) Trent XWB time limits manual (TLM) and the operator's existing approved aircraft maintenance program (AMP). Since the FAA issued AD 2021-15-01, the manufacturer has revised the TLM life limits and updated mandatory inspection intervals of certain critical rotating parts. This AD requires revisions to the ALS of the RR Trent XWB TLM and the operator's existing approved AMP, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
