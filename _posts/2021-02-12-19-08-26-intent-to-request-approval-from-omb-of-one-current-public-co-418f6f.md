## Summary

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) invites public comment on one currently approved Information Collection Request (ICR), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number 1652-0064, abstracted below that we will submit to OMB for an extension in compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected burden. The collection involves an application completed by airport operators desiring to opt-out of passenger and baggage security screening performed by federal employees, preferring a qualified private screening company to perform security screening functions under a contract entered into with TSA.
