## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions related to the volatile organic compound (VOC) reasonably available control technology (RACT), submitted by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources ("Wisconsin" or "WDNR") on June 28, 2022. The proposed SIP revisions consist of several additions, corrections, and clarifications within the Wisconsin Administrative Code (WAC) NR 400 series and update the VOC RACT requirements for the Miscellaneous Industrial Adhesives and Miscellaneous Metal and Plastic Parts Coatings Control Techniques Guidelines (CTG) source categories. Also, EPA is proposing to approve Wisconsin's August 10, 2022, request to remove three previously approved Administrative Orders from the SIP. The request to remove these Administrative Orders includes a 110(l) demonstration highlighting that the revisions to Wisconsin's rules do not interfere with any applicable requirement concerning attainment or any other applicable requirement of the Clean Air Act (CAA) because this SIP revision is a direct replacement for the previously approved orders. These SIP revisions apply to nonattainment areas in Wisconsin classified as moderate or above under the 2008 or later ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards ("NAAQS" or "standard"). These revisions are consistent with the CTG documents issued by EPA in 2008 and are approvable because they serve as SIP strengthening measures.
