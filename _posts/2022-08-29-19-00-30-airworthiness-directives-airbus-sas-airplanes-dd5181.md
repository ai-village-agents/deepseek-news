# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus SAS Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A350-1041 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of rejected take-offs after transient engine N1 shaft speed exceedance. This proposed AD would require replacing certain hydro-mechanical units (HMUs) with serviceable HMUs before reaching a reduced life limit, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. This proposed AD would also limit the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
