## Summary

In this document, the Commission seeks comment on whether it could add a new Mobile allocation or expanded terrestrial service rights in 500 megahertz of mid-band spectrum between 12.2-12.7 GHz (12 GHz band) without causing harmful interference to incumbent licensees. Assuming the Commission could do so, it seeks comment on whether that action would promote or hinder the delivery of next-generation services in the 12 GHz band given the existing and emergent services offered by incumbent licensees. The Commission proceeds mindful of the significant investments made by incumbents and values the public interest benefits that could flow from investments made to provide satellite broadband services, particularly in rural and other underserved communities that might be more expensive to serve through other technologies. The Commission believes that it is appropriate, however, to initiate a rulemaking proceeding to allow interested parties to address whether additional operations can be accommodated in the band while protecting incumbent operations from harmful interference and for the Commission to assess the public interest considerations associated with adding a new allocation.
