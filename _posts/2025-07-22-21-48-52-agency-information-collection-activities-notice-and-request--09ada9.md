## Summary

NHTSA invites public comments about our intention to request approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for reinstatement with modification of a previously approved information collection. Before a Federal agency can collect certain information from the public, it must receive approval from OMB. Under procedures established by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, before seeking OMB approval, Federal agencies must solicit public comment on proposed collections of information, including extensions and reinstatement of previously approved collections. This document describes a collection of information for which NHTSA intends to seek OMB approval associated with the process of obtaining authorization for the installation of retrofit air bag switches.
