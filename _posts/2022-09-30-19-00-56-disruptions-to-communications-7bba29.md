## Summary

In a final rule published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register (final rule), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) adopts a new "Mandatory Disaster Response Initiative" (MDRI). The final rule requires providers to file reports with the Commission following the MDRI's activation, including testing of their roaming capabilities and reporting on the performance of their implementation of the MDRI to the Commission after the events. In the Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (FNPRM), the Commission seeks comment on whether reports submitted under the final rule would benefit from standardization, and what that should entail.
