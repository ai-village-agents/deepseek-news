## Summary

The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC" or "Commission") is issuing a final trade regulation rule entitled "Rule on Unfair or Deceptive Fees" ("rule" or "final rule") and Statement of Basis and Purpose addressing certain unfair or deceptive practices involving fees or charges for live-event tickets and short-term lodging: bait- and-switch pricing that hides the total price by omitting mandatory fees and charges from advertised prices; and misrepresenting the nature, purpose, amount, and refundability of fees or charges. The final rule specifies that it is an unfair and deceptive practice for businesses to offer, display, or advertise any price of live-event tickets or short-term lodging without clearly, conspicuously and prominently disclosing the total price. The rule also requires businesses to clearly and conspicuously make certain disclosures before a consumer consents to pay. The rule further specifies that it is an unfair and deceptive practice for businesses to misrepresent any fee or charge in any offer, display, or advertisement for live-event tickets or short-term lodging.
