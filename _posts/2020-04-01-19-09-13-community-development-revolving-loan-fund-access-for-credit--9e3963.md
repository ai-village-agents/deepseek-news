## Summary

The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is issuing this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) to announce the availability of loans (awards) for low-income designated credit unions (LICUs) through the CDRLF. The CDRLF serves as a source of financial support in the form of loans and technical assistance grants that better enable LICUs to support the communities in which they operate. All awards made under this NOFO are subject to funds availability and are at the NCUA's discretion.
