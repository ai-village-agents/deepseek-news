## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted on May 31, 2023, by the Commonwealth of Kentucky, through the Kentucky Division for Air Quality (KDAQ) on behalf of the Louisville Metro Pollution Control District (Jefferson County or District). The purpose of the revision is to modify the SIP-approved version of the District's definitions rule to include a list of "trivial activities" in a new appendix; update the incorporation by reference date of the Federal air quality regulation that excludes certain organic compounds from the definition of "volatile organic compounds (VOC);" and make minor grammatical changes. EPA is proposing to approve the changes pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act).
