## Summary

On behalf of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) National Coordination Office (NCO) welcomes input from all interested parties on how the previous administration's National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan (2023 Update) can be rewritten so that the United States can secure its position as the unrivaled world leader in artificial intelligence by performing R&D to accelerate AI-driven innovation, enhance U.S. economic and national security, promote human flourishing, and maintain the United States' dominance in AI while focusing on the Federal government's unique role in AI research and development (R&D) over the next 3 to 5 years. Through this Request for Information (RFI), the NITRD NCO encourages the contribution of ideas from the public, including AI researchers, industry leaders, and other stakeholders directly engaged in or affected by AI R&D. Responses previously submitted to the RFI on the Development of an AI Action Plan will also be considered in updating the National AI R&D Strategic Plan.
