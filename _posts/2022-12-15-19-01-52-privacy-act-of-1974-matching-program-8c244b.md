## Summary

The United States Small Business Administration (SBA) and Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) pursuant to Section 862 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, Public Law 116-283, 134 Stat. 3388 (January 1, 2021), amended 38 U.S.C. 8127 and transferred the responsibility for certification of Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) to SBA as of January 1, 2023 (Transfer Date). The Computer Matching program seeks to ensure that applicants for SBA Veteran Small Business Certification Program are eligible as qualifying veterans. This will be accomplished by matching specific VA data with SBA data to determine what applicants and participants meet SBA's Veteran Small Business Certification Program criteria.
