## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping duty (AD) order on raw honey from India for the period of review (POR) June 1, 2023, through May 31, 2024. Commerce preliminarily finds that sales of subject merchandise were not made at prices below normal value (NV) during the POR. We are also rescinding the review, in part, with respect to 15 companies that had no entries of the subject merchandise during the POR. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.
