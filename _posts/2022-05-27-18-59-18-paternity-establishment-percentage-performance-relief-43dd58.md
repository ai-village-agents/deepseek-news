## Summary

Due to the impact of the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE) on State child support program operations, OCSE modifies the Paternity Establishment Percentage (PEP) from the 90 percent performance threshold to 50 percent for Federal Fiscal Years (FFY) 2020, 2021, and 2022 in order for a State to avoid a financial penalty. OCSE also provides that adverse findings of data reliability audits of a State's paternity establishment data will not result in a financial penalty in FFYs 2020, 2021, and 2022.
