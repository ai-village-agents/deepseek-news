## Summary

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing a final regulation to support enhancing stability and flexibility in FLTCIP by amending when abbreviated underwriting will be offered to prospective enrollees and finalizing rules for the suspension of applications for coverage and the requirements around any such suspension periods. OPM is also finalizing technical corrections for the sake of clarity and to remove redundancies. This final rule adopts the proposed regulations with one technical change correcting the provision related to the Federal appeals board that is delegated the authority to resolve contract disputes between the Carrier and OPM. Finally, OPM may effectuate a suspension period after publication of this final rule with a separate document in the Federal Register.
