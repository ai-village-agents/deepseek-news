## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a special local regulation for certain waters on the East River in Mathews, VA. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters during an annual "Wharf to Wharf Swim." This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from entering the regulated area unless authorized by the Captain of the Port, Sector Virginia or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
