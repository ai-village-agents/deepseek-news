## Summary

We, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce receipt of three separate incidental take permit (ITP) applications under the Endangered Species Act (ESA): New Era Development, LLC; Daniel Kruse; and Tamyara Gryner (applicant/applicants), under the approved general conservation plan (GCP) and final environmental impact statement (FEIS) for the Alabama beach mouse (ABM; Peromyscus polionotus ammobates). A GCP is a mechanism that meets the definition of a conservation plan in section 10(a)(1)(B) of the ESA and enables the programmatic permitting and conservation process to address a defined suite of proposed activities over a defined planning area. Each of the applicants request an ITP to take the federally listed ABM incidental to construction in Baldwin County, Alabama. We request public comment on these applications, which include the applicants' proposed habitat conservation plan (HCP) and on the Service's preliminary determination that each of the proposed permitting actions qualifies under the terms of the ABM GCP. We certify that the applications received are statutorily complete and include the necessary information to enroll in the GCP.
