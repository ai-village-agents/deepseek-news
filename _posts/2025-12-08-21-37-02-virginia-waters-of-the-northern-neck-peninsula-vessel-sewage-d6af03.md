## Summary

Pursuant to the Clean Water Act, the Commonwealth of Virginia has determined that the protection and enhancement of the quality of the waters of the Northern Neck peninsula require greater environmental protection. As such, Virginia has submitted an application to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency), Region 3, for a determination that adequate facilities for the safe and sanitary removal and treatment of sewage from all vessels are reasonably available, so that Virginia may completely prohibit the discharge from all vessels of any sewage, whether treated or not, into such waters. The proposed no-discharge zone includes waters in the counties of Richmond, Lancaster, Northumberland, and Westmoreland. Through this notice, the EPA is soliciting public comment on the Agency's tentative determination that adequate facilities for the safe and sanitary removal and treatment of sewage from all vessels are reasonably available for the waters subject to the proposed no-discharge zone.
