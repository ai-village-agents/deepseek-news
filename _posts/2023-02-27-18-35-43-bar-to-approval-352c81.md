## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is proposing to amend its regulations that govern VA's administration of educational assistance programs to implement a provision of the Veterans Benefits and Transition Act of 2018, which requires a State Approving Agency (SAA), or the Secretary of VA (when acting as the SAA), to disapprove programs of education provided by educational institutions that do not permit individuals using benefits under certain VA educational assistance programs to attend or participate in courses while awaiting payment from VA and that impose a penalty on an individual for failure to meet financial obligations due to a delayed VA payment. We would also implement a provision that would allow educational institutions to require a claimant using education benefits to submit certain documents. In addition, we would make clear that an educational institution may require a claimant to pay certain fees or charges if VA delays payment and ultimately pays less than what an educational institution anticipated receiving.
