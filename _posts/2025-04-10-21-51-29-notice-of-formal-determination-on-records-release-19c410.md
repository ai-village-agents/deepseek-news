## Summary

The Civil Rights Cold Case Records Review Board received 212 pages of records from the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the Department of Justice, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) related to a civil rights cold case incident to which the Review Board assigned the unique identifier 2023-001-002. NARA did not propose any postponements of disclosure. The Department of Justice and the FBI proposed 471 postponements of disclosure. The Department of Justice later withdrew two postponements it proposed. On March 28, 2025, the Review Board met and approved 186 postponements, requested changes to 26 postponements, and determined that 168 pages in full and 44 pages in part should be publicly disclosed in the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection. By issuing this notice, the Review Board complies with section 7(c)(4) of the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018 that requires the Review Board to publish in the Federal Register its determinations on the disclosure or postponement of records in the Collection no more than 14 days after the date of its decision.
