## Summary

We are extending the comment period for a notice of availability of a pest risk assessment and a commodity import evaluation document that we have prepared relative to the importation into the United States of fresh table grapes from regions of Chile where European grapevine moth (Lobesia botrana) is either absent or at very low prevalence. This action will allow interested persons additional time to prepare and submit comments.
