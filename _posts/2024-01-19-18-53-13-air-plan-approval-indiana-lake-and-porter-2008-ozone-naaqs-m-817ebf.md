## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve Indiana's September 21, 2023, state implementation plan (SIP) submission which revises the 2008 ozone maintenance plan for the Indiana Portion (Lake and Porter Counties) of the Chicago Naperville, IL-IN-WI area. This SIP submission updates onroad vehicle emissions inventories for oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) for the years 2019, 2030 and 2035. In addition to updated emissions inventories, this SIP revision updates the Motor Vehicle Emissions Budgets (budgets) for NO<INF>X</INF> and VOC for the years 2030 and 2035. EPA is proposing to approve the allocation of a portion of the safety margins for NO<INF>X</INF> and VOC in the ozone maintenance plan to the 2030 and 2035 budgets. Total year 2030 and 2035 emissions of NO<INF>X</INF> and VOC for the area will remain below the attainment level required by the transportation conformity regulations.
