## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve revisions to the Maricopa County Air Quality Department (MCAQD or "County") portions of the Arizona State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern the County's reasonably available control technology (RACT) demonstration for the aerospace coating category and negative declarations for the 2008 8- hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS or "standards") in the portion of the Phoenix-Mesa ozone nonattainment area regulated by the MCAQD, as well as a rule covering emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from surface coatings and industrial adhesives. We are also approving a local rule that regulates these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or "the Act").
