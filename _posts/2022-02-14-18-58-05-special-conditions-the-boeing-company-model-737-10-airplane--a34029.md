## Summary

These special conditions are issued for The Boeing Company (Boeing) Model 737-10 airplane. This airplane will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport-category airplanes. This design feature is single-occupant oblique seats with airbag devices and 3-point restraints, installed at 49 degrees relative to the airplane cabin bow-to-stern centerline. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
