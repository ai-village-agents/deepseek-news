## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to amend the rules that regulate vessel traffic and control navigation on portions of waterways in the Lake Michigan Captain of the Port Zone during events that will introduce extra or unusual hazards to the safety of life on the navigable waters of the United States. This proposed rulemaking will reorganize five separate regulations of a similar nature currently listed in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) into a single regulation, make minor formatting changes for consistency, move six existing events into this regulation, update the dates listed for events, and list these regulations in table form. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
