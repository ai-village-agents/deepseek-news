## Summary

Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on February 10, 2020, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of NYZ AB of Sweden; Swedish Match North America, LLC of Richmond, Virginia; Pinkerton Tobacco Co., LP of Owensboro, Kentucky; and wm17 holding GmbH of Switzerland. A supplement to the complaint was filed on February 21, 2020. The complaint, as supplemented, alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain nicotine pouches and components thereof and methods of making the same by reason of infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 9,161,908 ("the '908 patent"). The complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The complainants request that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a limited exclusion order and cease and desist orders.
