## Summary

We are advising the public that we added the Kingdom of Lesotho, the Republic of Benin, and the Republic of Botswana to the list of regions that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service considers to be affected by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). These actions follow our imposition of HPAI-related restrictions on avian commodities originating from or transiting the Kingdom of Lesotho, the Republic of Benin, and the Republic of Botswana, as a result of the confirmation of HPAI in the Kingdom of Lesotho, the Republic of Benin, and the Republic of Botswana.
