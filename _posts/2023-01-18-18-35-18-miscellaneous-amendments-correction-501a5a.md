## Summary

On December 9, 2022, the FAA published a final rule titled "Miscellaneous Amendments". That document made technical amendments to various parts of the FAA's regulations, and inadvertently identified the Amendment Nos. for certain parts of the CFR as 25-146, 33-1, 47-32, 73-1, and 101-9. The correct Amendment Nos. are 25-148, 33-35, 47-34, 73-9, and 101-11. This document makes those corrections.
