## Summary

The Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Treasury) administers the corporate Federal surety bond program (the program). Treasury issues certificates of authority to qualified sureties to underwrite and reinsure Federal surety bond obligations. Treasury also recognizes qualified companies as admitted reinsurers who can provide reinsurance to certified companies except on Federal surety bonds. Treasury recognizes an admitted reinsurer for the purpose of providing credit to a surety for non-Federal obligations ceded to an admitted reinsurer when valuing the assets and liabilities of a surety for Treasury certificate purposes, as appropriate. Treasury is proposing to amend its regulations to allow for recognition of additional companies as reinsurers that are excluded under the current regulations. Additionally, Treasury proposes to amend its regulations to incorporate requirements for surety companies to submit information that Treasury uses to perform financial analysis of these companies, which was previously published in supplemental guidance documents. Treasury also proposes a reorganization of the existing regulations to modernize and improve their structure.
