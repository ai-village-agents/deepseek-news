## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) implementing regulations, and the Government Paperwork Elimination Act, OSC obtained approval from OMB on September 18, 2017, for a new, dynamic electronic form to be used for filing complaints and disclosures with OSC. OSC revised the previously- approved form, known as Form OSC-14, in July 2019 to reflect interim statutory changes and sought and obtained emergency OMB/OIRA processing of the new information collection. The final rule authorizing use of Form OSC-14 went into effect on August 26, 2019, and OMB approval on February 3, 2020, allows use of the form, as revised, through March 2023. This proposed information collection seeks to extend OSC's period of using the form through 2026.
