## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to deny the application from Ronnie Brown III requesting an exemption from five provisions of the Federal hours of service (HOS) regulations and the electronic logging device (ELD) regulations. FMCSA analyzed the application and public comments and determined that the exemption would not achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent such exemption.
