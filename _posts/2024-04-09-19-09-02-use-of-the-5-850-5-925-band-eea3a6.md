## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) rejects a Petition for Reconsideration and a Petition for Partial Reconsideration of the First Report and Order filed by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation (Auto Innovators) and the 5G Automotive Association (5GAA), respectively. In the First Report and Order, the Commission repurposed the 5.850-5.895 GHz portion of the 5.850-5.925 GHz (5.9 GHz) band (lower 45 megahertz) from intelligent transportation system (ITS) use to provide more flexible unlicensed use, while continuing to dedicate the 5.895-5.925 GHz portion of the 5.9 GHz band (upper 30 megahertz) for vital ITS applications. It also adopted technical and operating rules to minimize the potential for unlicensed operations in the lower 45 megahertz to cause harmful interference to incumbent 5.9 GHz band services--including federal incumbents and ITS operations. Auto Innovators, through its petition, sought reconsideration of the Commission's decision to redesignate the lower 45 megahertz for unlicensed use. 5GAA, through its petition, sought reconsideration of the unlicensed device out-of-band emissions (OOBE) limits into the upper 30 megahertz retained for ITS operations. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission denied the petitions and affirmed the Commission's decision to repurpose spectrum previously designated for ITS services to provide more flexibility for unlicensed device uses to help meet the burgeoning demand for wireless broadband in the United States.
