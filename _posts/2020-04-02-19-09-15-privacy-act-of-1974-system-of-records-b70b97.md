## Summary

The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) is modifying the System of Records, Mandatory Declassification Review Files, DWHS E05. This system was established to verify and declassify record requests from the public and to provide a resource to research historical data. Without the ability to review and declassify data in the Mandatory Declassification Review (MDR) Files System of Records, information in the system would not be releasable to the public and the DoD would not comply with the applicable regulations and laws. Updates to this system include administrative changes required by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-108, "Federal Agency Responsibilities for Review, Reporting, and Publication under the Privacy Act," revised December 23, 2016. This modification includes changes to the system name, authorities, purpose, categories of records, routine uses, storage of records, retention and disposal of records, safeguards, records access procedures, contesting record procedures, notification procedures, and exemptions sections. In addition, the only exemption claimed for the system, (k)(1), is being deleted, since the system does not contain classified information. The records undergoing MDR are stored in a separate system, which is not a Privacy Act System of Records.
