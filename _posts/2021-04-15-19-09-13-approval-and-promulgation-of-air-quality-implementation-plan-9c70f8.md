## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve the regional haze state implementation plan (SIP) submitted by the District of Columbia ("the District" or "DC") through the Department of Energy and Environment (DOEE) on November 8, 2019, as satisfying applicable requirements under the Clean Air Act (CAA) and EPA's Regional Haze Rule (RHR) for the program's second implementation period. The District's SIP submission addresses the requirement that states must periodically revise their long-term strategies for making reasonable progress towards the national goal of preventing any future, and remedying any existing, anthropogenic impairment of visibility in mandatory Class I Federal areas, including regional haze. EPA is taking this action pursuant to sections 110 and 169A of the CAA. EPA is also proposing to correct an error in the citations in our final approval of the District's revision to the Reasonably Available Control Technology for Major Stationary Sources of Nitrogen Oxides Rule ("DC NO<INF>X</INF> RACT rule") according to our authority under Section 110(k)(6) of the CAA.
