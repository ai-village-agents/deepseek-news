## Summary

The FAA is withdrawing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) that would have applied to certain Eurocopter France (now Airbus Helicopters) Model AS350B, BA, B1, B2, B3, C, D, and D1; EC-130B4; and AS355E, F, F1, F2, and N helicopters. The NPRM would have required modifying the collective hold-down strap (strap) and thereafter inspecting it at specified intervals to ensure the rubber grommet is resting against the console or replacing the strap with a strap that has a torsional spring at the lower end of the strap. Since issuance of the NPRM, the FAA issued AD 2014-02-05, which addresses the unsafe condition identified in the NPRM. Accordingly, the NPRM is withdrawn.
