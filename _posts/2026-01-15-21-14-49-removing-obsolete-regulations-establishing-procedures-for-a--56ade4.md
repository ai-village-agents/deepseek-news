## Summary

By this rule, the Department of Commerce is removing its regulations establishing a voluntary labeling program for household appliances and equipment designed to promote energy conservation. This action is necessary because the voluntary program is obsolete and has been superseded by the comprehensive Appliance Labeling Rule, administered by the Department of Energy and the Federal Trade Commission, which mandates manufacturers attach EnergyGuide labels to their products to help consumers compare different products and make informed purchasing decisions. The intended effect of this removal is to streamline the regulatory code, eliminate a duplicative and unnecessary program, and reduce the potential for public confusion.
