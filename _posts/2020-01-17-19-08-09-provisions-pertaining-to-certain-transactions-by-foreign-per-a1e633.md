## Summary

The final rule establishes regulations to implement the provisions relating to real estate transactions in section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended by the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018. This rule sets forth the scope of, and process and procedures relating to, the national security review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States of certain transactions involving the purchase or lease by, or concession to, a foreign person of certain real estate in the United States. The interim rule also adds a new definition for the term "principal place of business," and the Department of the Treasury is seeking comments on this definition.
