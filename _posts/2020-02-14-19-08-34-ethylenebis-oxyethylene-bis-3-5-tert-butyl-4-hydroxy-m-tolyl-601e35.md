## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of ethylenebis(oxyethylene) bis[3-(5-tert- butyl-4-hydroxy-m-tolyl) propionate] when used as an inert ingredient (stabilizer) limited to 1% (by weight) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops, and raw agricultural commodities after harvest. Syngenta Crop Protection, LLC submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of ethylenebis(oxyethylene) bis[3-(5-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy- m-tolyl) propionate] when used in accordance with the terms of this exemption.
