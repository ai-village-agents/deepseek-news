## Summary

The FAA is correcting a final rule that published in the Federal Register on June 1, 2022. The rule modified the Class E surface airspace, removed Class E airspace designated as an extension to Class D and E surface areas, and modified Class E airspace beginning at 700 feet above the surface. The final rule incorrectly listed the effective date of 0901 UTC, July 14, 2022. This action corrects the effective date to 0901 UTC, September 8, 2022.
