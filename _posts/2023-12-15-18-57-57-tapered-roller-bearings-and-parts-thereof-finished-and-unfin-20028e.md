## Summary

As a result of this expedited sunset review, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) finds that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) order on tapered roller bearings (TRBs) from the People's Republic of China (China) would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping at the levels indicated in the "Final Results of Expedited Sunset Review" section of this notice.
