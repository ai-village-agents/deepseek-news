## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-07- 05, which applied to certain MarS A.S. emergency parachutes. AD 2022- 07-05 superseded AD 2022-05-09, expanded the applicability, and required removing all emergency parachutes manufactured since 2016. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-07-05, MarS A.S. developed a modification for the emergency parachutes to correct the unsafe condition. This AD requires modifying and re-identifying the emergency parachutes. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
