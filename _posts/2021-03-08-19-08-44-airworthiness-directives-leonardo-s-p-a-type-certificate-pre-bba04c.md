## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede airworthiness directive (AD) 2015-25-04 for Agusta S.p.A (now Leonardo S.p.a.) Model A109A and A109A II helicopters. AD 2015-25-04 requires inspecting the slider assembly pitch control (slider) for play and replacing the slider if the play exceeds certain limits. Since the FAA issued AD 2015-25-04, further investigation determined the play was caused by a manufacturing issue. This proposed AD would retain certain requirements of AD 2015-25-04, require replacing certain part-numbered sliders as a terminating action for the inspections, and prohibit installing the affected part on any helicopter. The actions of this proposed AD are intended to address an unsafe condition on these products.
