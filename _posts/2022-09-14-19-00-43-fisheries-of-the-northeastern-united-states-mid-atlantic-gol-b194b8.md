## Summary

NMFS proposes to approve and implement Framework Adjustment 7 to the Tilefish Fishery Management Plan, which includes 2022-2024 specifications for the golden tilefish fishery for fishing years 2022- 2024, a change to the annual specifications process, and a change to the start of the golden tilefish fishing year. The proposed action is necessary to establish allowable harvest levels and other management measures to prevent overfishing while allowing optimum yield, consistent with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act and the Tilefish Fishery Management Plan. This action is intended to ensure measures are based on the best scientific information available and increase flexibility, where possible, for the tilefish fishery.
