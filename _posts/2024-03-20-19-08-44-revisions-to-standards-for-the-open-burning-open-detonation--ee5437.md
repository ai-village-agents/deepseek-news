## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) proposes to revise regulations that allow for the open burning and detonation (OB/OD) of waste explosives. This allowance or "variance" to the prohibition on the open burning of hazardous waste was established at a time when there were no alternatives for the safe treatment of waste explosives. However, recent findings from the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) and the EPA have identified safe alternatives which are potentially applicable to treat some energetic/explosive waste streams. Because there may be safe alternatives available and in use today that capture and treat emissions prior to release, regulations would be revised to describe specified procedures for the existing requirements to evaluate and implement alternative treatment technologies. These proposed revisions would reduce OB/OD of waste explosives and increase control of air emissions through improved implementation of existing requirements that facilities must evaluate and use safe and available alternative technologies in lieu of OB/OD.
