## Summary

The FAA is correcting a final rule that appeared in the Federal Register on March 3, 2022. The rule modified the Class D and Class E surface airspace, established Class E airspace designated as an extension to Class D & E surface areas, Class E airspace beginning at 700 feet above the surface, removed navigational aids (NAVAIDs) from text headers, and made administrative changes to the legal descriptions at Southwest Oregon Regional Airport, North Bend, OR. The Final Rule did not explain the purposeful removal of Class E airspace beginning at 1,200 feet above the surface, nor did it properly exclude the Sunnyhill Airport cut-out. This action adds verbiage explaining the removal of Class E airspace beginning at 1,200 feet above the surface, and corrects the legal description for the newly established Class E airspace designated as an extension to Class D & E surface areas to properly exclude Sunnyhill Airport, OR.
