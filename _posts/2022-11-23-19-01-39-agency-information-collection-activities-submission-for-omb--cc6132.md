In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice seeks comments regarding the requirements, grants management procedures, and implementation of grants awarded under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), which is a post-disaster program that contributes funds toward the cost of hazard mitigation activities to reduce the risk of future damage, hardship, loss or suffering in any area affected by a major disaster.
