## Summary

This interim final rule (IFR) ensures that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT or Department) operates its Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) and Airport Concession Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (ACDBE) Programs (collectively, Programs) in a nondiscriminatory fashion--in line with law and the U.S. Constitution. The IFR removes race- and sex-based presumptions of social and economic disadvantage that violate the U.S. Constitution.
