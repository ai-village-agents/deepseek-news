## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approves revisions to the Oregon State Implementation Plan (SIP) applicable in Lane County, Oregon, as meeting Clean Air Act requirements. The revisions, submitted on June 26, 2024, align local stationary source permitting rules with existing State rules by eliminating generic plant site emission limits in favor of source-specific limits, updating construction notification requirements, clarifying the use of modeling and monitoring related to permitting, and streamlining the permit application process.
