## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 757 airplanes and Model 767 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that radio altimeters cannot be relied upon to perform their intended function if they experience interference from wireless broadband operations in the 3.7-3.98 GHz frequency band (5G C-Band), and a recent determination that, during approach, landings, and go-arounds, as a result of this interference, certain airplane systems may not properly function, resulting in increased flightcrew workload while on approach with the flight director, autothrottle, or autopilot engaged. The FAA is issuing this AD to address 5G C-Band interference that could result in increased flightcrew workload and could lead to reduced ability of the flightcrew to maintain safe flight and landing of the airplane. This AD requires revising the limitations and operating procedures sections of the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to incorporate specific operating procedures for landing distance calculations, instrument landing system (ILS) approaches, non-precision approaches, speedbrake deployment, and go-around and missed approaches, when in the presence of 5G C-Band interference as identified by Notices to Air Missions (NOTAMs). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
