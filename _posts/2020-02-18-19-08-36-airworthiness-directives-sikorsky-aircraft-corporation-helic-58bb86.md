# Airworthiness Directives; Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (Sikorsky) Model S-92A helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by two incidents of erroneous low oil pressure caution cockpit indications and unintended actuation of the main gearbox (MGB) auto bypass valve. This proposed AD would require installing auxiliary circuit breaker modification (MOD) kits and inserting a Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) Supplement into the RFM for your helicopter. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
