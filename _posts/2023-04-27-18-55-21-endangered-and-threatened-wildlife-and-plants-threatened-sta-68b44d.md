## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce that we are reopening the comment periods on our October 28, 2013, proposed rules to list the Bi-State distinct population segment (DPS) of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) (hereafter Bi-State DPS) as threatened under the Endangered Species Act (Act) with a section 4(d) rule and to designate critical habitat for the Bi-State DPS. The District Court for the Northern District of California vacated our March 31, 2020, withdrawal of the October 28, 2013, proposed listing rule, and that action serves to reinstate the proposed listing rule. We will initiate a new status review to determine whether the Bi- State DPS meets the definition of an endangered or threatened species under the Act. We request new information to inform this status review. Comments previously submitted need not be resubmitted, as they will be fully considered in preparing the final determination.
