## Summary

Mammoth Mountain Ski Area (MMSA) has submitted a proposal to the Inyo National Forest (the Forest) to pursue approval of select projects from its 2022 Master Development Plan (MDP) on National Forest System (NFS) lands, in accordance with its existing Special Use Permit (SUP). The Proposed Action includes: new lifts, lift replacements and realignments, additional ski terrain development, new buildings and parking lots for guest and employee use, road reconstruction and construction of a new road, trail construction for pedestrians and bike connectivity, extensions of existing utilities and on-mountain infrastructure, and other infrastructure improvements to support base area development on private parcels. The Inyo National Forest plans to complete a combined environmental impact statement (EIS)/Environmental Impact Report (EIR) with the Town of Mammoth Lakes because a number of projects proposed are entirely on private lands.
