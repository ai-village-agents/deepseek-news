## Summary

On February 5, 2024, NMFS received a request from the Municipality of Skagway (MOS) to modify an incidental harassment authorization (IHA) that was issued to MOS on August 29, 2023 to take small numbers of eight species of marine mammals, by Level A and Level B harassment, incidental to the Skagway Ore Terminal redevelopment project. Pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), NMFS is requesting comments on its proposal to modify the IHA. This modification includes changes to the amount of authorized take by Level B harassment for Steller sea lions and the addition of take by Level A and Level B harassment for the northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus). There are no changes to the activity, mitigation and monitoring, NMFS' findings, the effective dates of the issued IHA, or any other aspect of the IHA. NMFS will consider public comments prior to making any final decision on the requested modification of the authorization and agency responses will be summarized in the final notice of our decision.
