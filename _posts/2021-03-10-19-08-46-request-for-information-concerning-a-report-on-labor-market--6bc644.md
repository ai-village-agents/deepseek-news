## Summary

The Department of Labor (the "Department") requests information on issues related to the development of a report concerning "Labor Market Information on the Indian Workforce," pursuant to the requirement in the Indian Employment, Training and Related Services Consolidation Act of 2017. The law tasks the Secretary of Labor to "in a consistent and reliable manner, develop, maintain and publish, not less than biennially" information related to 574 federally recognized tribes who are eligible for services under the Bureau of Indian Affairs (in the Department of the Interior). The Department invites tribal leaders, representatives, data specialists, and tribal members, as well as researchers and other interested parties to submit information related to the discussion and questions identified in the Supplementary Information section below. Responses to this Request for Information (RFI) will help the Department to identify approaches for generating accurate, timely and useful labor market information, and will complement the Department's consultations, as required under the law, with the Department of the Interior, tribes, and the Census Bureau.
