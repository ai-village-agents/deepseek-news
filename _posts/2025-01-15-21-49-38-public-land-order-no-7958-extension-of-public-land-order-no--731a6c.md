## Summary

This order extends the duration of the withdrawal created by Public Land Order (PLO) No. 6597, as extended by PLO No. 7621, for an additional 20-year period. PLO No. 6597, as extended, withdrew 20 acres of public land administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in Sweetwater County, Wyoming from settlement, sale, location, or entry under the general land laws, including the United States mining laws, but not from leasing under the mineral leasing laws, for 20 years, subject to valid existing rights, to protect the White Mountain Petroglyphs Site. Extension of the withdrawal is necessary to protect the Native American, cultural resource, wildlife, scenic, and educational values of, as well as the capital investment in, the White Mountain Petroglyphs Site.
