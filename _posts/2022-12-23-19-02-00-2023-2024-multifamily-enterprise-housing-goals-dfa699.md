## Summary

The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA or the Agency) is issuing a final rule on the multifamily housing goals for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the Enterprises) for 2023 and 2024. The Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (the Safety and Soundness Act) requires FHFA to establish annual housing goals for mortgages purchased by the Enterprises. Under FHFA's existing housing goals regulation, the multifamily housing goals for the Enterprises include benchmark levels through the end of 2022 based on the total number of affordable units in multifamily properties financed by mortgage loans purchased by the Enterprise each year. This final rule amends the regulation to establish benchmark levels for the multifamily housing goals for 2023 and 2024 based on a new methodology--the percentage of affordable units in multifamily properties financed by mortgages purchased by the Enterprise each year.
