## Summary

NRCS, in cooperation with the New York City (NYC) Parks and Recreation Department GreenThumb Network, is issuing this notice to advise Federal, State and local government agencies and the public that USDA NRCS is rescinding the Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the GreenThumb Gardens Water Supply Project Watershed Plan which was published in the Federal Register on April 24, 2024. NRCS conducted an Environmental Evaluation (EE) and determined that the action has no reasonably foreseeable significant effect, and the action is identified within scope of a Categorical Exclusion (CE). NRCS is rescinding the NOI because these findings will satisfy the NEPA requirements for this project and an EIS is no longer necessary.
