## Summary

We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), are announcing receipt of a proposed amendment to the Pennsylvania regulatory program (hereinafter, the Pennsylvania program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). The proposed amendment would make changes to Pennsylvania's Coal Refuse Disposal Control Act. Those changes would include establishing the terms and conditions under which a system that prevents precipitation from contacting coal refuse must be installed, requiring that the regulations regarding temporary cessation at coal refuse disposal areas conform with Federal SMCRA regulations, and providing for future regulations addressing the connection with source mines that are in temporary cessation in determining temporary cessation for the coal refuse disposal permit. This document provides the times and locations that the Pennsylvania program and this proposed amendment to that program are available for your inspection, the comment period during which you may submit written comments on the amendment, and the procedures that we will follow for the public hearing, if one is requested.
