## Summary

We, NMFS, are announcing 5-year reviews of four species listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973, as amended. The four distinct population segments (DPSs) included in this notice are the southern DPS of eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus), the Puget Sound/ Georgia Basin DPSs of yelloweye rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus) and bocaccio (S. paucispinis), and the southern DPS of green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris). The purpose of these reviews is to ensure the accuracy of the listing classifications of these threatened and endangered species. The 5-year reviews will be based on the best scientific and commercial data available at the time of the reviews; therefore, we are requesting that interested parties submit any new relevant information on these DPSs that has become available since the original listing determinations or since the species' status was last updated. Based on the results of these 5-year reviews, we will make the requisite determinations under the ESA.
