## Summary

The Coast Guard requests public comments on the planned consolidation of three redundant, seasonally operated Coast Guard boat stations and the seasonalization of one Coast Guard boat station. As modern boat operating speeds rise and navigation technology improves, the Coast Guard can respond to incidents with multiple units significantly faster than when these boat stations were first established. The combination of significantly improved response times, along with an overall reduction in rescue calls due to boating safety improvements throughout the Nation, has resulted in a number of boat stations becoming redundant. This consolidation will result in a more robust response system by increasing staffing levels and capacity at select nearby boat stations. The seasonalization of a unit shifts the Coast Guard's response to Search and Rescue cases from a more robustly staffed nearby boat station during the winter months.
