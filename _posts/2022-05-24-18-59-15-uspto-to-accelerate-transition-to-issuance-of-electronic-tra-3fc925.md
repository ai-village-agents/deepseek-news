## Summary

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is accelerating the transition date for issuance of electronic trademark registration certificates to May 24, 2022. On and after that date, the electronic registration certificate will be the official registration certificate. Because of a nationwide shortage of the specialized paper, and a recent vendor disruption, the USPTO will not issue registration certificates between May 10 and May 23, 2022, while the USPTO transitions to this new program. The new program will make the issuance of registration certificates more resilient. After the USPTO begins issuing electronic registration certificates, trademark owners will have the option to order paper "presentation" copies. Registrants will also continue to be able to order certified copies of their trademark registrations.
