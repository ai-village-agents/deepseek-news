## Summary

This action proposes to amend Class D airspace, Class E surface airspace, and Class E airspace designated as an extension to a Class D surface area and Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Athens/Ben Epps Airport, Athens, GA as a result of the biennial airspace evaluation. This action would eliminate the excess airspace remaining after the decommissioning of the Bulldog Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) and subsequent cancellation of the NDB Runway 27 approach to Athens/Ben Epps Airport effective October 15, 2015, as well as update the geographic coordinates for the airport and the point-of-origin. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.
