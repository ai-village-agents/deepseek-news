## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of potassium acetate (CAS Reg. No. 127-08- 2) when used as an inert ingredient (nutrient) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops only. Valagro S.p.A. submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for potassium acetate. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of potassium acetate when used in accordance with this exemption.
