## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-19-25 and AD 2014-03-12, which applied to all Dassault Aviation Model FALCON 2000 airplanes. Those ADs required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new maintenance requirements and airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2018-19-25, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD continues to require those maintenance or inspection program revisions, and also requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. This AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
