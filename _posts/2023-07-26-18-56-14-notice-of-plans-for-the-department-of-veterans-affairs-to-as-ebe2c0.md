## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announces its plan to assess the scientific literature and historical claims data regarding certain medical conditions associated with military environmental exposures. This assessment will consider the possibility of a relationship between the following medical conditions--acute leukemias, chronic leukemias and multiple myeloma--and exposure to fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) from airborne hazards and open burn pits for service members who were deployed in the Southwest Asia theater of operations, Somalia, Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, and Uzbekistan. Multiple myeloma, when it originates in the head or neck, is considered a presumptive condition pursuant to the PACT Act. However, cases of multiple myeloma originating outside of the head and neck have not yet been evaluated for association with exposure to PM<INF>2.5</INF> from airborne hazards and open burn pits in the Southwest Asia theater of operations, Somalia, Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, and Uzbekistan. Additionally, a scientific review of acute leukemias, chronic leukemias, and multiple myeloma and exposure to PM<INF>2.5</INF> and its associated chemical composition from airborne hazards and open burn pits in the Southwest Asia theater of operations, Somalia, Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, and Uzbekistan would provide an opportunity to review an organ system (blood) not included in the PACT Act. VA solicits public comment on the importance of completing this assessment of scientific literature and historical claims data for these conditions or others. Once the conclusions of this scientific assessment have been peer reviewed, they may be used to inform decisions regarding veteran's qualifying period of service, such as those who served on active military, naval, or air service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War, as well as Somalia, Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, or Uzbekistan from September 11, 2001, until the present time.
