## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC, the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Renewed Facility Operating License No. TR-5, issued to the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), for operation of the National Bureau of Standards test reactor (NBSR). The proposed amendment would revise the NBSR Safety Analysis Report (SAR) to allow reactor operation with the debris that remains in the reactor primary coolant system from the February 3, 2021, fuel damage event and after the subsequent cleaning operations. The proposed amendment would not authorize the restart of the NBSR.
