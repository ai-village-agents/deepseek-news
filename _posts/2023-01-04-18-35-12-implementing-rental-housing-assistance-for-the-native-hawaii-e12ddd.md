## Summary

Through this notice of proposed rulemaking, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is proposing to amend its regulations covering rental housing assistance for the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant (NHHBG) program, consistent with the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA). HUD proposes to clarify and improve consistency with NAHASDA's statutory requirements and HUD's Indian Housing Block Grant program regulations. This proposed rule would also help make affordable housing opportunities, in the form of NHHBG-assisted rental housing, more available to eligible Native Hawaiian families.
