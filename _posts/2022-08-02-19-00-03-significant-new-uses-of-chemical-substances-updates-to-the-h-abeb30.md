## Summary

EPA is issuing a correction to a final rule that published in the Federal Register of Tuesday, July 5, 2022. The document revised the regulations governing significant new uses of chemical substances under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to align with revisions that were made to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Hazard Communications Standard (HCS) and changes to the OSHA Respiratory Protection Standard and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) respirator certification requirements for the respiratory protection of workers from exposure to chemicals. EPA also amended the regulations governing Significant New Use Rules (SNURs) to address issues that have been identified by EPA and raised by stakeholders through public comments and made a minor change to reporting requirements for premanufacture notices (PMNs) and other TSCA notifications. This document corrects inadvertent errors in three of the amendatory instructions that appeared in the regulatory text potion of the final rule.
