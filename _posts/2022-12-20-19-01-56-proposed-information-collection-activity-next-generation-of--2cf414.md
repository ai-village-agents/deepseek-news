## Summary

The Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation (OPRE) within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is proposing an extension to the data collection activities conducted for the Next Generation of Enhanced Employment Strategies (NextGen) Project (Office of Management and Budget (OMB) #0970-0545). The project is rigorously evaluating innovative interventions to promote employment and economic security among low-income individuals with complex challenges. The project includes an experimental impact study, descriptive study, and cost study. This extension will allow additional time to conduct study intake, collect data from NextGen programs and staff, and to conduct participant data collections. No changes are proposed to the data collection instruments.
