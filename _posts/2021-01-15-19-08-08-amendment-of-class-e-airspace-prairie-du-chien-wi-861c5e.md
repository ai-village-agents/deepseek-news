## Summary

This action amends the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Prairie Du Chien Municipal Airport, Prairie Du Chien, WI. This action is the result of an airspace review caused by the decommissioning of the Waukon VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) navigation aid as part of the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program. The geographic coordinates of the airport are also being updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
