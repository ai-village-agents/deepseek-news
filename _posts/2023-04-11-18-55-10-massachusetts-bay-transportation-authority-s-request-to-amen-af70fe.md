## Summary

This document provides the public with notice that, on March 23, 2023, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) submitted a request for amendment (RFA) to its FRA-certified positive train control (PTC) system in order to support the reconfiguration of its underlying Automatic Train Control (ATC) system on its commuter rail network. On MBTA's South Side, the ATC System in the area is being reconfigured requiring the PTC system to be taken out of service during the reconfiguration as well as during the recommissioning of the ATC system and MBTA's Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System II (ACSES II). FRA is publishing this notice and inviting public comment on MBTA's RFA to its PTC system.
