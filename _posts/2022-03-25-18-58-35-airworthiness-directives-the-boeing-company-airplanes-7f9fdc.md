## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) AD 2021-06-03, which applies to all The Boeing Company Model 777F series airplanes. AD 2021-06-03 requires deactivating the potable water system. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-06-03, Boeing developed new actions to address the unsafe condition, which terminate the action required by AD 2021-06-03. This proposed AD would retain the actions required by AD 2021-06-03 and would require installing a shroud to the water supply line in the forward cargo compartment, and performing a leak test of the potable water system. For certain airplanes, this proposed AD would also require replacing tubes and hoses from the water supply line and installing a shroud to the water return line. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
