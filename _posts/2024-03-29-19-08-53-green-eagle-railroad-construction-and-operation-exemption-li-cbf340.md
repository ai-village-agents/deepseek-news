## Summary

On December 14, 2023, Green Eagle Railroad, LLC (GER), a subsidiary of Puerto Verde Holdings (PVH), filed a petition with the Surface Transportation Board (Board) for authority to construct and operate approximately 1.3 miles of new common carrier rail line (the Line) in Maverick County, Texas. The Line would extend from the United States/Mexico border to the existing Union Pacific Railroad (UP) connection at approximate UP milepost 31. The Line would be part of a larger project proposed by PVH, the Puerto Verde Global Trade Bridge (PVGTB Project), consisting of a new trade corridor for freight rail and commercial motor vehicles between Piedras Negras, Coahuila, Mexico, and Eagle Pass, Texas, United States. The Board's Office of Environmental Analysis (OEA) determined that the construction and operation of the Line has the potential to result in significant environmental impacts; therefore, the preparation of an EIS is appropriate pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). In addition to the Line, the PVGTB Project in the United States includes an approximately 1.3-mile roadway and other infrastructure as described below. Only the Line requires licensing authority from the Board. The Line and the roadway would cross the Rio Grande River via two new bridges. Separately from the Board's final decision on GER's petition, the proposed bridges would require permits from the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). USCG will participate as a Cooperating Agency in the EIS process.
