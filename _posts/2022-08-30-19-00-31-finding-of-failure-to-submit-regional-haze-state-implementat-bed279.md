## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action finding that 15 states have failed to submit State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to satisfy the visibility protection requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA), as described in implementing regulations, for the regional haze second planning period. These findings of failure to submit establish a 2-year deadline for the EPA to promulgate Federal Implementation Plans (FIPs) to address these requirements for a given state unless, prior to the EPA promulgating a FIP, the state submits, and the EPA approves, a SIP that meets these requirements.
