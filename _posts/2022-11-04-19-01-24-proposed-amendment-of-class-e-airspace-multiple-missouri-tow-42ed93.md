## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace at Hannibal, MO; Monroe City, MO; and Monticello, MO. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of airspace reviews conducted as part of the decommissioning of the Quincy very high frequency (VHF) omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimal Operational Network (MON) Program. The name of CPT Ben Smith Airfield-Monroe City Airport, Monroe City, MO, would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
