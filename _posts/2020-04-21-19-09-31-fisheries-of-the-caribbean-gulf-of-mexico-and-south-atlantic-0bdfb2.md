## Summary

NMFS issues regulations to implement management measures as described in an abbreviated framework action to the Fishery Management Plans (FMPs) for the Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico (Reef Fish FMP) and Coastal Migratory Pelagic Resources of the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Region (CMP FMP). This final rule enables eligible permit holders to replace historical captain endorsements in the reef fish and CMP fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) with standard Federal charter vessel/headboat permits to reduce the regulatory and economic burden on historical captains. In addition, NMFS is correcting an inadvertent error in the final rule for Amendment 20A to the CMP FMP regarding commercial king mackerel permit requirements.
