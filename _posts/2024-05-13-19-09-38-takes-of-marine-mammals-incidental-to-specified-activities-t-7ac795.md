## Summary

NMFS received a request from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) for the renewal of their currently active incidental harassment authorization (IHA) to take marine mammals incidental to the Debris Dock Replacement Project in Sausalito, California. ACOE activities are identical to those covered in the current authorization. ACOE's activities will not be completed prior to the renewal authorization. Pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), prior to issuing the currently active IHA, NMFS requested comments on both the proposed IHA and the potential for renewing the initial authorization if certain requirements were satisfied. The renewal requirements have been satisfied, and NMFS is now providing an additional 15-day comment period to allow for any additional comments on the proposed renewal not previously provided during the initial 30- day comment period.
