# Fisheries of the Northeastern United States; Northeast Multispecies Fishery; Gulf of Maine Cod Possession and Trip Limit Adjustment for the Common Pool Fishery

## Summary

This action decreases the possession and trip limits for Gulf of Maine (GOM) cod for Northeast multispecies common pool vessels for the remainder of the 2023 fishing year, through April 30, 2024. The National Marine Fisheries Service projects that, at its current trajectory, the common pool will exceed its 2023 sub-Annual Catch Limit for GOM cod. This decrease in the possession and trip limit for Gulf of Maine cod is intended to prevent the common pool fishery from exceeding its allocation for this stock prior to the end of the fishing year.
