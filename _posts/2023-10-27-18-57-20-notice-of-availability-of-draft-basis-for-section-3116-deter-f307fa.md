## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announces the availability of the Draft Basis for Section 3116 Determination for Closure of the Calcined Solids Storage Facility at the Idaho National Laboratory Site (Draft CSSF 3116 Basis Document). The Draft CSSF 3116 Basis Document demonstrates that the Calcined Solids Storage Facility (CSSF) at closure after waste retrieval is not high-level radioactive waste (HLW) and may be disposed of in place as low-level radioactive waste (LLW). DOE prepared the Draft CSSF 3116 Basis Document pursuant to Section 3116 of the "Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005" (hereafter NDAA Section 3116). DOE is consulting with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and is also making the Draft CSSF 3116 Basis Document available for comments from states, Tribal Nations, stakeholders, and the public. After consultation with the NRC, carefully considering comments received, and performing any necessary revisions of analyses and technical documents, DOE will prepare a final CSSF 3116 Basis Document. Based on the final document, the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the NRC, may determine in the future whether the stabilized CSSF bins (including integral equipment), transport lines, and any residual waste remaining therein at closure are non-HLW and may be disposed of in place as LLW.
