## Summary

This notice announces actions taken by the FHWA, on behalf of the Nebraska Department of Transportation, that are final. The action(s) relate to the Norfolk--Wisner Project, located in Stanton County and Cuming County, Nebraska. Those actions grant licenses, permits, and approvals for the project. The project will expand the existing two-lane highway to a four-lane expressway. The project begins east of Norfolk, approximately 0.30 miles east of the intersection of US-275 and Nebraska Highway 57 (N-57) at approximately mile marker (MM) 86. It extends east and south to approximately 17th Street in Wisner near MM 102, where it ties into the existing US-275 four-lane roadway. The FHWA's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) provides details on the Selected Alternative for the proposed improvements.
