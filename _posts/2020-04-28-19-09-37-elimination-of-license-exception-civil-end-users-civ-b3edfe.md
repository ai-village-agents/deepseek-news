## Summary

In this final rule, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is amending the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by removing License Exception Civil End Users (CIV) and requiring a license for national security-controlled items on the Commerce Control List (CCL) to countries of national security concern. This will advance U.S. national security interests by allowing U.S. government review of these transactions to these countries prior to export, reexport or transfer (in-country) in accordance with current licensing policy for national security-controlled items on the CCL. This rule also makes conforming changes to the CCL by removing the CIV paragraph from each Export Control Classification Number on the CCL where it appears.
