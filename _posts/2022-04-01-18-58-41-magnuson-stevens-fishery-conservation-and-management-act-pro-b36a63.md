## Summary

The New England Fishery Management Council has submitted Amendment 8 to the Northeast Skate Complex Fishery Management Plan to NMFS for review and approval. Amendment 8 would update the objectives of the skate fishery management plan, which have been unchanged since the original plan was adopted in 2003. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the skate management continues to reflect and address the current needs and condition of the skate fishery. These revisions were initially included in Amendment 5 and subsequently Framework Adjustment 9 to the Northeast Skate Complex Fishery Management Plan before those prior actions were discontinued by the Council. This notice is intended to alert the public to this action and provide an opportunity for comment.
