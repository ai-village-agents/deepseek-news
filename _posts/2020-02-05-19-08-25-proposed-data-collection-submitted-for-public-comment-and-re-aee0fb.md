## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled "2019 Novel Coronavirus Airport Entry Questionnaires and Aircraft Contact Investigations Information Collection," which will provide CDC with the ability to perform enhanced public health assessments of travelers from China, or other areas affected by the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, to determine risk of infection with 2019-nCoV, and to facilitate any necessary public health follow-up.
