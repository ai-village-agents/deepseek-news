## Summary

The Coast Guard announces its intent to enter into a cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) with several companies to evaluate the suitability of implementing Wide Area Network (WAN) optimization technology in a shipboard environment. The CRADA will explore WAN optimization technologies and how they can be implemented for shipboard use under a variety of scenarios. While the Coast Guard is currently considering partnering with SWISH DATA CORPORATION (SWISH), we are soliciting public comment on the possible participation of other parties in the proposed CRADA. The Coast Guard also invites other potential non-Federal participants, who have the interest and capability to bring similar contributions to this type of research, to consider submitting proposals for consideration in similar CRADAs.
