## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 727 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that excessive sealant coating on internal wing Structural Significant Items (SSIs) may not reveal cracks during inspections required by AD 98-11-03 R1. This AD requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate inspections that will give no less than the required damage tolerance rating (DTR) for certain SSIs of the wing. This AD also requires repetitive inspections for cracking of the affected SSIs and repair if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
