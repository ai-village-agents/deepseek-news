## Summary

The OCC, Board, and FDIC (together, the agencies) are jointly issuing principles that provide a high-level framework for the safe and sound management of exposures to climate-related financial risks (principles). Although all financial institutions, regardless of size, may have material exposures to climate-related financial risks, these principles are intended for the largest financial institutions, those with over $100 billion in total consolidated assets. The principles are intended to support efforts by large financial institutions to focus on key aspects of climate-related financial risk management.
