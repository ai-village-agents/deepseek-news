## Summary

In this document, the Commission, takes actions implementing section 9201 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, exploring opportunities to improve the way the public receives emergency alerts from the nation's Emergency Alert System (EAS) and Wireless Emergency Alerts System (WEA) on their mobile phones, televisions, and radios. We propose rules to ensure that more people receive relevant emergency alerts, to enable EAS and WEA participants to report false alerts when they occur, and to improve the way states plan for emergency alerts. In addition, we initiate an inquiry to examine the feasibility of updating the EAS to enable or improve alerts to consumers provided through the internet, including through streaming services, and from radio and television stations, cable systems, satellite radio and television providers, and wireline video providers that currently participate in EAS. As directed by Congress, after the conclusion of this inquiry the Commission will submit a report on its findings and conclusions to specified Committees of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.
