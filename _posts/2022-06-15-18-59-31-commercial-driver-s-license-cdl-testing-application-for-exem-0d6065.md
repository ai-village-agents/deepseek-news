## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to deny the State of Minnesota's request for reconsideration of the Agency's 2017 denial of an application for exemption from the regulations governing the commercial driver's license (CDL) skills testing procedures and practices. Specifically, the Agency denies Minnesota's request to perform the CDL skills test in the order specified in the CDL regulations. The Agency denies Minnesota's requested relief from the requirement to use the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators' (AAMVA) 2005 Test Model Score Sheet and from the requirement that skills tests be conducted in three parts.
