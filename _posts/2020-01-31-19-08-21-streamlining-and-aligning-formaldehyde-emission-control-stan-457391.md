## Summary

HUD is issuing a final rule to implement the Formaldehyde Standards for Composite Wood Products Act of 2010, which added Title VI to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The purpose of TSCA Title VI is to reduce exposures to formaldehyde emissions from composite wood products, thereby resulting in benefits from avoided adverse health effects. In addition, HUD is removing certain aspects of the current manufactured housing formaldehyde standards requirements that are not addressed by TSCA. This final rule follows publication of a March 22, 2019, proposed rule and takes into consideration the public comments received on the proposed rule. This final rule also incorporates by reference, ASTM D6007-14 and ASTM E1333-14, the current standard requirements for formaldehyde concentration and emissions rate air chamber testing.
