# Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Miscellaneous Gas Products

## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE" or "the Department") is initiating an effort to evaluate the potential for energy conservation standards for consumer miscellaneous gas products. DOE published a proposed coverage determination for these products in the Federal Register on February 7, 2022. This request for information ("RFI") solicits information from the public to help DOE determine whether potential standards for miscellaneous gas products would result in significant energy savings and whether such standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, information which will prove useful in the event DOE moves forward with a final coverage determination. As part of this RFI and to aid in the Department's evaluation, DOE seeks comment on the market for these products and technologies to improve their energy efficiency or reduce their energy consumption. DOE also welcomes written comments from the public on any subject within the scope of this document (including topics not specifically raised), as well as the submission of data and other relevant information.
