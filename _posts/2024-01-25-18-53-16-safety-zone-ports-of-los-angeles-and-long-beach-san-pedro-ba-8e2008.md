## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary moving safety zone around the M/V ZHEN HUA 36 while it transits to the Port Long Beach, CA, to Long Beach Container Terminal (LBCT), Pier 22, then through the Port of Los Angeles to Everport, Pier LA 227. This safety zone is necessary to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards associated with oversized cargo transfer operations of three quay cranes, which will extend more than 200 feet out from the transiting vessels. Entry of persons or vessels into this safety zone is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port (COTP) Los Angeles-Long Beach, or their designated representative.
