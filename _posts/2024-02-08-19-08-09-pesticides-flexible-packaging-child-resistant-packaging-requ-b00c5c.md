## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined that pesticide products marketed in flexible packaging (e.g., pouches) 20 fluid ounces or less in size with labeling either directly recommending residential use or reasonably interpreted to permit residential use are subject to the Child Resistant Packaging (CRP) mitigation measures, regardless of acute toxicity requirements, based on the visual similarity of the packaging design to children's food products. As such, pesticide applicants and registrants must comply with CRP for this packaging type at the size limits specified when labeled for or reasonably interpreted to permit residential use and EPA will evaluate applications for new products or amendments to currently registered products submitted to EPA under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended by the Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2022 (referred to as "PRIA 5"). Changes to packaging to implement CRP measures on existing products must be submitted as described in this document to allow for CRP data review. Additionally, the Agency is including recommended labeling mitigation for all flexible packaging, regardless of packaging size and intended use site.
