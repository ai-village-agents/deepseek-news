## Summary

The Office of Government Ethics (OGE) proposes to revise one of its existing internal systems of records pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. This system of records currently contains personally identifiable information (PII) collected from Federal employees and/or members of the public who register to attend or otherwise participate in OGE meetings and events. The system is currently designated OGE/INTERNAL-6, Online Registration for OGE-Hosted Meetings and Events. OGE proposes to revise the system of records to contain additional records associated with OGE professional development offerings, including ongoing educational and certification programs, as well as the one-time events currently covered. OGE also proposes to change the name to reflect these changes.
