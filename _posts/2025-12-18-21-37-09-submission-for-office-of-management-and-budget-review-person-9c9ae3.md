## Summary

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services seeks approval of the Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP) Innovative Strategies (PREIS) Local Evaluation Support: Final Evaluation Report Template for PREIS grantees. PREIS grant recipients are required to carry out local evaluations of their programs and submit a final evaluation report to ACF documenting their analyses and findings. This request includes guidance for grant recipients in the form of templates. Information will inform technical assistance (TA) to support grantees in developing and submitting the final reports to ACF to fulfill a grant requirement. We do not intend for this information to be used as the principal basis for public policy decisions.
