## Summary

On July 22, 2016, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 became law. One provision of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 amended the Controlled Substances Act to allow for the partial filling of prescriptions for schedule II controlled substances under certain conditions. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is amending its regulations to conform to this statutory provision, as well as to provide direction on gaps not addressed by legislation. DEA will also be amending its regulations to update a cross-reference in a paragraph that will be redesignated with this final rule.
