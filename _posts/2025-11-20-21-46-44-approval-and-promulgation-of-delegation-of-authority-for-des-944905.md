## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a request from the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD) for delegation of authority to implement and enforce the Federal Plan Requirements for Sewage Sludge Incineration (SSI) units within Allegheny County in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. On April 29, 2016, the EPA promulgated the Federal Plan for SSI units to fulfill the requirements of sections 111(d)/129 of the Clean Air Act (CAA). The Federal Plan addresses the implementation and enforcement of the emission guidelines applicable to existing SSI units located in areas not covered by an approved and currently effective state plan. The Federal Plan imposes emission limits and other control requirements for existing affected SSI facilities which will reduce designated pollutants.
