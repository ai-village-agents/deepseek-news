## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2013-07- 03, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A330-200, A330-200 Freighter, A330-300, A340-200, and A340-300 series airplanes; and Model A340-541 and A340-642 airplanes. AD 2013-07-03 required repetitive inspections for degradation of the bogie pivot pins and for any cracks and damage of the pivot pin bushes of the main and central landing gear; an inspection of the affected bogie pivot pins for corrosion and base metal cracks; and repairing or replacing bogie pivot pins and pivot pin bushes, if necessary. This AD was prompted by development of a modification that address the unsafe condition and a determination that a parts installation prohibition is necessary. This AD continues to require certain actions in AD 2013-07-03, add an optional modification that would terminate the repetitive inspections, and add a parts installation prohibition, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
