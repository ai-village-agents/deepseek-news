## Summary

On November 9, 2020, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule titled "Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes; California; South Coast Moderate Area Plan and Reclassification as Serious Nonattainment for the 2012 PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS." That publication inadvertently omitted from the description of the Riverside County portion of the designated area, language indicating that the lands of the Santa Rosa Band of Cahuilla Mission Indians and Pechanga Band of Luiseno Mission Indians of the Pechanga Reservation are excluded from that portion of the Los Angeles-South Coast Air Basin nonattainment area for the 2012 national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>). This document corrects the error in the regulatory text.
