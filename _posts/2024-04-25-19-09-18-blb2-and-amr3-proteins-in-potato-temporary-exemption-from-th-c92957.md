## Summary

This regulation amends and extends a temporary exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of the BLB2 and AMR3 proteins in potato, when used as a plant-incorporated protectant (PIP) in accordance with the terms of Experimental Use Permit (EUP) No. 8971- EUP-3. J.R. Simplot Company, submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting the temporary tolerance exemption. This regulation eliminates the need under FFDCA to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of BLB2 and AMR3 proteins. The temporary tolerance exemption expires on March 31, 2025.
