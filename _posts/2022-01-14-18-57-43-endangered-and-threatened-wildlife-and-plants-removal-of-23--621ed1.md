## Summary

This document corrects a date in a document that reopened a comment period on a proposed rule and announced a public hearing. On January 11, 2022, we, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, announced that we are reopening the public comment period on our September 30, 2021, proposal to remove 23 species from the Federal Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants (List) due to extinction. We also announced a public hearing on the proposal to remove the ivory- billed woodpecker from the List and stated that the comment period reopening is only for the ivory-billed woodpecker proposed delisting. The document stated that the public hearing would take place on January 26, 2021. The correct date is January 26, 2022.
