## Summary

This interim final rule implements changes related to the forgiveness and review of loans made under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which was originally established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) to provide economic relief to small businesses nationwide adversely impacted by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act (Economic Aid Act) was enacted, extending the authority to make PPP loans through March 31, 2021, revising certain PPP requirements, and permitting second draw PPP loans. This interim final rule consolidates prior rules related to forgiveness and reviews of PPP loans and incorporates changes made by the Economic Aid Act, including with respect to forgiveness of second draw PPP loans.
