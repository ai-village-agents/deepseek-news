## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission or Agency) has modified and renamed an existing system of records, FCC/ PSHSB-1, FCC Emergency and Continuity Alerts and Contacts System (ECACS) (formerly: FCC/PSHSB-1, FCC Emergency and Continuity Contacts System (ECCS)), subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. This action is necessary to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act to publish in the Federal Register notice of the existence and character of records maintained by the Agency. The FCC's Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau (PSHSB) uses the information in ECACS to prepare for and coordinate crisis response activities wherever they occur in the United States and its territories. PSHSB is modifying FCC/ PSHSB-1 to include information it will use to evaluate the effectiveness of Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA), including participating Commercial Mobile Service Providers' ("providers") implementation of enhanced geo-targeting for WEA.
