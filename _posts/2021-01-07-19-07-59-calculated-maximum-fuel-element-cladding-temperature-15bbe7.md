## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is denying two related petitions for rulemaking (PRMs), PRM-50-93 and PRM-50-95, submitted by Mark Edward Leyse. The petitioner requested that the NRC amend its regulations for the domestic licensing of production and utilization facilities. The petitioner asserted that data from multirod (assembly) severe fuel damage experiments indicate that specific aspects of the NRC's regulations on emergency core cooling systems acceptance criteria and evaluation models are not conservative and that additional regulations are necessary. The NRC is denying these petitions because existing NRC regulations provide reasonable assurance of adequate protection of public health and safety. The petitioner did not present sufficient new information or arguments to support the requested changes.
