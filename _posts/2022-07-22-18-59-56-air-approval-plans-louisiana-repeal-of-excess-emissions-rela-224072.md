## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA, the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Louisiana, through the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ), on November 20, 2016. The submittal is in response to the EPA's national SIP call of June 12, 2015, concerning excess emissions during periods of Startup, Shutdown, and Malfunction (SSM). The submittal requests the removal of certain provisions identified in the 2015 SIP call from the Louisiana SIP. EPA is also proposing to determine that the removal of the substantially inadequate provisions from the SIP corrects certain deficiencies identified in the June 12, 2015 SIP call.
