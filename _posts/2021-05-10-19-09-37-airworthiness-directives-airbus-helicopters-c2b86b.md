## Summary

The FAA is revising a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that applied to certain Airbus Helicopters Model EC225LP helicopters. This action revises the NPRM by revising the required actions paragraph such that the required actions apply to all helicopter models specified in the applicability. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive (AD) to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over those in the NPRM, the agency is requesting comments on this SNPRM.
