## Summary

The Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) is amending department regulations to provide parties to a hearing or appeal the option of sending and receiving documents electronically; to specifically recognize the OHA Director's authority to issue Standing Orders to provide procedural information to parties and the public; and to make clear that OHA will communicate information on how and where to file and serve documents through OHA Standing Orders issued by the Director and posted on OHA's Department of the Interior website. This rule removes specific office addresses, some outdated, from the regulatory text and provides for up-to-date contact information to be provided in OHA Standing Orders on Contact Information. This rule further provides that OHA may issue Standing Orders to provide procedural information in an emergency or to address an immediate need, such as an office closure, natural disaster or other unanticipated event. This rule, and the associated Standing Orders, would not add to, change, or diminish any substantive rights of any parties or the public.
