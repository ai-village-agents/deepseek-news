## Summary

By establishing selection criteria and requirements for the NOAA Rear Admiral Richard T. Brennan Ocean Mapping Matching Fund program, to be known as the Brennan Matching Fund, this notice invites non-Federal entities to partner with NOAA National Ocean Service's ocean and coastal mapping programs on jointly funded projects of mutual interest. NOAA would receive and match partner funds and rely on its existing contract arrangements to conduct the surveying and mapping activities in FY2024. Proposers benefit from this opportunity by leveraging NOAA's contracting expertise, including its pool of pre- qualified technical experts in surveying and mapping as well as data management to ensure that the mapping data are fit for purpose and are usable for a broad set of purposes. This program is subject to funding availability.
