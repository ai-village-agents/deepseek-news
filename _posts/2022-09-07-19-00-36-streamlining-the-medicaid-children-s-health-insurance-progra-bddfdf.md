## Summary

This rulemaking proposes changes to simplify the processes for eligible individuals to enroll and retain eligibility in Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the Basic Health Program. This proposed rule would remove barriers and facilitate enrollment of new applicants, particularly those dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid; align enrollment and renewal requirements for most individuals in Medicaid; establish beneficiary protections related to returned mail; create timeliness requirements for redeterminations of eligibility in Medicaid and CHIP; make transitions between programs easier; eliminate access barriers for children enrolled in CHIP by prohibiting premium lock-out periods, waiting periods, and benefit limitations; and modernize recordkeeping requirements to ensure proper documentation of eligibility and enrollment.
