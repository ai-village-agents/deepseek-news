## Summary

The Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard, is establishing a Regulated Navigation Area for certain waters of the Duluth-Superior Harbor and the St. Louis River in Duluth, MN. This action is necessary to prevent disruption of an engineered sediment remediation project within one of the Great Lakes designated Areas of Concern (AOC); the St. Louis River. This interim rulemaking prohibits anchoring, spudding, dredging, dragging, or any other activity which could potentially disturb the riverbed in the designated area unless authorized by the District Commander or the Captain of the Port. We invite your comments on this interim rulemaking.
