## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 737-900ER series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of significant corrosion of electrical connectors located in the main landing gear (MLG) wheel well. This proposed AD would require repetitive records checks to determine exposure to certain deicing fluids or repetitive inspections for corrosion of the electrical connectors, and corrective actions if necessary. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
