## Summary

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is amending its regulations governing use of the official FDIC sign and insured depository institutions' (IDIs) advertising statements to reflect how depositors conduct business with IDIs today, including through digital and mobile channels. The final rule also clarifies the FDIC's regulations regarding misrepresentations of deposit insurance coverage by addressing specific scenarios where consumers may be misled as to whether they are conducting business with an IDI and whether their funds are protected by federal deposit insurance. The final rule is intended to enable consumers to better understand when they are conducting business with an IDI and when their funds are protected by the FDIC's deposit insurance coverage.
