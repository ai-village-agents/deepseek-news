## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes to amend the portion of the rating schedule dealing with mental disorders, including revising the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders and combining currently separate General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders with the General Rating Formula for Eating Disorders in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (VASRD or rating schedule). The proposed rule reflects changes made by the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5), advances in medical knowledge, and recommendations from VA's Mental Disorders Work Group.
