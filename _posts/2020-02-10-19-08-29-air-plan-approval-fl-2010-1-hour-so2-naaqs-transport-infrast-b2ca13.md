## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve Florida's September 18, 2018, State Implementation Plan (SIP) submission pertaining to the "good neighbor" provision of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) for the 2010 1-hour sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). The good neighbor provision requires each state's implementation plan to address the interstate transport of air pollution in amounts that contribute significantly to nonattainment, or interfere with maintenance, of a NAAQS in any other state. In this action, EPA is proposing to determine that Florida will not contribute significantly to nonattainment or interfere with maintenance of the 2010 1-hour SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS in any other state. Therefore, EPA is proposing to approve the September 18, 2018, SIP revision as meeting the requirements of the good neighbor provision for the 2010 1-hour SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS.
