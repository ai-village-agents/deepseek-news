## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to deny the application from Leland Schmitt, Jr., requesting an exemption from five provisions of the federal hours of service (HOS) regulations. The applicant requests the exemption for a five-year period and believes that his safe driving record and experience demonstrate an equivalent level of safety. FMCSA analyzed the application and public comments and determined that the exemption would not achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent such exemption.
