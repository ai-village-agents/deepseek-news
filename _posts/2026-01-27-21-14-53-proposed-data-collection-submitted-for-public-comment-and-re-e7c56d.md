## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing efforts to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled, Evaluation of the Supporting Young Breast Cancer Survivors, Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients, and their Families Program. CDC is requesting to collect information about this program using a web-based survey and in-depth interviews to assess whether a specific cooperative agreement has been implemented as intended and to understand recipients' achievements of the program goals and outcomes.
