## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily determines that imports of certain high carbon steel (HCS) wire that are produced in Mexico and assembled or completed into prestressed concrete steel wire strand (PC strand) in the United States are circumventing the antidumping duty (AD) order on PC strand from Mexico. As a result, all imports of certain HCS wire from Mexico will be subject to suspension of liquidation on or after July 31, 2023. Commerce is also imposing a certification requirement. We invite interested parties to comment on this preliminary determination.
