## Summary

The Director of the Water Division, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 10, proposes to reissue the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) General Permit for Federal Aquaculture Facilities and Aquaculture Facilities Located in Indian Country in Washington (draft general permit). As proposed, eligible facilities include Concentrated Aquatic Animal Production (CAAP) facilities, non-CAAP facilities, aquaculture research facilities, and dam fish passage facilities. Currently, there are 32 facilities covered under the existing administratively continued general permit. Existing aquaculture facilities may request authorization to discharge under the general permit by submitting a Notice of Intent (NOI) no more than ninety (90) days following the effective date of the draft general permit. New facilities that begin operations after the effective date of the draft general permit must submit a NOI at least 180 days prior to initiation of operations. Upon receipt, EPA will review the NOI to ensure that all permit requirements are met. If determined appropriate by EPA, a discharger will be granted coverage under the general permit upon the date that EPA provides written notification. EPA is accepting public comments on the draft general permit.
