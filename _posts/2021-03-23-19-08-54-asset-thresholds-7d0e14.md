## Summary

To mitigate transition costs on credit unions related to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 Pandemic), the NCUA Board (Board) is issuing this temporary interim final rule to permit federally insured credit unions (FICUs) to use asset data as of March 31, 2020, in order to determine the applicability of certain regulatory asset thresholds during calendar years 2021 and 2022. Specifically, the interim final rule allows a FICU to use March 31, 2020, financial data when determining whether the institution is subject to capital planning and stress testing requirements under the NCUA's regulations and supervision from the Office of National Examinations and Supervision.
