## Summary

On July 11, 2023, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) solicited comments on three draft documents that provide revised guidance for subsequent license renewal (SLR) and the associated technical bases for the revised guidance documents. The draft regulatory guidance documents consist of draft NUREG-2191, "Generic Aging Lessons Learned for Subsequent License Renewal Report," Volumes 1 and 2, Revision 1 (GALL-SLR Report); draft NUREG-2192, "Standard Review Plan for Review of Subsequent License Renewal Applications for Nuclear Power Plants," Revision 1 (SRP-SLR); and draft NUREG-2221, "Technical Bases for Changes in the Subsequent License Renewal Guidance Documents, NUREG-2191, Revision 1, and NUREG-2192, Revision 1," Supplement 1. The public comment period was originally scheduled to close on September 11, 2023. The NRC has decided to extend the public comment period to allow more time for members of the public to prepare and submit their comments.
