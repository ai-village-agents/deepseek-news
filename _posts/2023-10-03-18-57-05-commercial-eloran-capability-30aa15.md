## Summary

The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to determine if there is interest from private entities in offering a U.S. commercial enhanced Long Range Navigation (eLoran) service to the general public in the United States on a fee-for-service basis without any Federal investment, subsidy, procurement commitment or other commitment of credit or budgetary resources. If respondent has an interest in offering a U.S.-based commercial eLoran service on a fee-for-service basis, identify what impediments stand in the way of respondent offering a U.S. commercial eLoran service. If lack of access to any federally-controlled assets and non-budgetary assistance related to utilizing such federally- controlled assets are identified as impediments to offering such a service, a subsequent Request for Information may be issued to obtain additional data.
