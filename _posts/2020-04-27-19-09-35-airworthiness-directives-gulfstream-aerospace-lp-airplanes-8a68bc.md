## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Gulfstream Aerospace LP Model Gulfstream G280 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of inadequate clearance between the fuel probes and forward fuel tank structure. This proposed AD would require measuring the clearance between certain fuel probes and the forward fuel tank structure, and reinstalling the probes if necessary, as specified in a Civil Aviation Authority of Israel (CAAI) AD, which will be incorporated by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
