## Summary

In June 2018, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) published a consumer product safety standard for high chairs under section 104 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA). The standard incorporated by reference the ASTM voluntary standard that was in effect for high chairs at the time. The CPSIA sets forth a process for updating mandatory standards for durable infant or toddler products that are based on a voluntary standard, when a voluntary standards organization revises the standard. In December 2020, ASTM published a revised voluntary standard for high chairs, and it notified the Commission of this revised standard in January 2021. This direct final rule updates the mandatory standard for high chairs to incorporate by reference ASTM's 2020 version of the voluntary standard for high chairs.
