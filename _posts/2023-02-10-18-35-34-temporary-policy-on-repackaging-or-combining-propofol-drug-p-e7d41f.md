## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the withdrawal of the guidance for industry entitled "Temporary Policy on Repackaging or Combining Propofol Drug Products During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency," which was issued in April 2020 to communicate a temporary policy regarding the repackaging or combining of propofol drug products.
