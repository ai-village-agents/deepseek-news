## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has issued exemptions in response to a request from the licensee regarding certain emergency planning (EP) requirements. The exemptions eliminate the requirements to maintain an offsite radiological emergency preparedness plan and reduce the scope of onsite EP activities at the Duane Arnold Energy Center, based on the reduced risks of accidents that could result in an offsite radiological release at a decommissioning nuclear power reactor.
