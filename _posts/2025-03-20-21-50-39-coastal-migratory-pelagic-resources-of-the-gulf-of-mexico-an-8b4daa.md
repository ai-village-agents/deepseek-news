## Summary

NMFS closes commercial harvest of king mackerel using run- around gillnet gear in the southern zone of the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) exclusive economic zone (EEZ). NMFS has determined that the commercial landings of king mackerel harvested by run-around gillnet gear in the southern zone have reached the annual catch limit (ACL). Therefore, NMFS implements an accountability measure (AM) and closes the southern zone to commercial king mackerel fishing using run-around gillnet gear in the Gulf EEZ. This closure is necessary to protect the Gulf king mackerel resource.
