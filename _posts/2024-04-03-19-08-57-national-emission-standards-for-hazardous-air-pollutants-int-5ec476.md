## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) is finalizing amendments to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Integrated Iron and Steel Manufacturing Facilities to regulate hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions. The amendments include: HAP from unmeasured fugitive and intermittent particulate (UFIP) sources previously not regulated by the NESHAP; previously unregulated HAP for sinter plants:; previously unregulated pollutants for blast furnace (BF) stoves and basic oxygen process furnaces (BOPFs) primary control devices; and previously unregulated pollutants for BF primary control devices. We are also finalizing an update to the technology review for this source category.
