In particular, these final regulations provide guidance as to when foreign persons are considered to hold directly or indirectly stock in a qualified investment entity. The final regulations primarily affect foreign persons that own stock in a qualified investment entity that would be a United States real property interest if the qualified investment entity were not domestically controlled.
