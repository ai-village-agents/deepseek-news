## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing new base Great Lakes pilotage rates for the 2026 shipping season while facilitating commerce and supply chains. The Coast Guard estimates that this proposed rule would result in an approximately 7-percent decrease in operating costs compared to the 2025 season. The Coast Guard is also proposing one change to the ratemaking methodology: the removal of Step 5 regarding the working capital fund. In accordance with the requirement to conduct a full ratemaking at least every 5 years, we are conducting a full ratemaking for 2026 and accepting comments on the Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking methodology.
