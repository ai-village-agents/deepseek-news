## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish three temporary safety zones for navigable waters within the Captain of the Port Maryland-National Capital Region Zone. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters of the Severn River in Anne Arundel County, MD, on July 3, 2021, (with alternate date of July 5, 2021), Kent Island Narrows (North Approach) in Queen Anne's County, MD, on July 4, 2021, (with alternate date of July 5, 2021), and Susquehanna River in Harford County, MD, on July 4, 2021, (with alternate date of July 5, 2021), during fireworks displays to commemorate the July 4th holiday. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in these safety zones unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Maryland-National Capital Region or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
