## Summary

We, NMFS, are issuing a final rule to list the Atlantic humpback dolphin (Sousa teuszii) as endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), in response to a petition from the Animal Welfare Institute, the Center for Biological Diversity, and VIVA Vaquita. We have reviewed the status of the Atlantic humpback dolphin, including efforts being made to protect the species, and considered public comments submitted on the proposed listing rule as well as new information received since publication of the proposed rule. Based on all of this information, we have determined that the Atlantic humpback dolphin warrants listing as an endangered species. We will not designate critical habitat for this species, because the geographical areas occupied by this species are entirely outside U.S. jurisdiction.
