# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus SAS Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A330-202, A330-203, A330-223, A330-243, and A330-841 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that the cold working process was partially completed on a certain circumferential joint. This proposed AD would require modification of the circumferential joint, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
