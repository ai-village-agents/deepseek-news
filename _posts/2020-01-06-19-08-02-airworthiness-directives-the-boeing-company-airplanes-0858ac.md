## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2016-18- 02, which applied to certain The Boeing Company Model 777-200 and - 300ER series airplanes. AD 2016-18-02 required replacing the low- pressure oxygen flex hoses with new non-conductive low-pressure oxygen flex hoses in the gaseous passenger oxygen system in airplanes equipped with therapeutic oxygen. This AD retains those actions and adds actions for certain airplanes. AD 2016-18-02 was prompted by the determination that the low-pressure oxygen flex hoses in the gaseous passenger oxygen system can potentially be conductive. This AD was further prompted by the determination that the associated service information is inadequate for certain airplanes. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
