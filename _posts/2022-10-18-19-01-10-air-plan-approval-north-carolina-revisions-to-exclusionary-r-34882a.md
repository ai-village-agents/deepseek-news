## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving portions of revisions to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the State of North Carolina, through the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, Division of Air Quality (DAQ), on September 18, 2009, and July 10, 2019. These revisions modify two different sections of the North Carolina SIP which (1) exclude certain categories of facilities from title V permitting requirements by imposing limitations on their potential emissions (Section 2Q .0800, "Exclusionary Rules"), and (2) exclude certain categories of facilities from the SIP's permitting requirements by imposing limitations on their potential emissions (Section 2Q .0900, "Permit Exemptions"). EPA is approving these revisions pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act).
