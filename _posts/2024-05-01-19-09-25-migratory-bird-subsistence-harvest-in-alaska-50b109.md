## Summary

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service or we) announces that we are extending the Kodiak Island Roaded Area experimental season for subsistence migratory bird hunting and egg gathering by registration permit for 1 year (through the spring-summer subsistence harvest season [hereafter, "season"] in 2024). As set forth in a 2021 final rule, this experimental season began in the 2021 season and was set to terminate at the end of the 2023 season. However, we are extending the experimental season to provide subsistence harvest opportunity for an additional year while an evaluation of harvest data from the first 3 years of the experimental season is completed and a long-term plan is developed. Extending the experimental season requires no revision of the regulations pertaining to subsistence harvest of migratory birds in Alaska; we are issuing this document solely for the purpose of public information.
