## Summary

Beginning August 5, 2022, and ending August 31, 2022, Federal longfin squid vessel permit holders are prohibited from fishing for, catching, possessing, transferring, or landing more than 250 lb (113.3 kg) of longfin squid per trip and landing such squid more than once per calendar day. This prohibition is required by regulation because NMFS projects that 90 percent of the 2022 annual Trimester II seasonal catch limit will have been caught by the effective date. In addition, based on this determination, other restrictions regarding catch of longfin squid by federally permitted Illex squid vessels and buying longfin squid by federally permit dealers go into place. This action is intended to prevent overharvest of longfin squid during Trimester II.
