## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2025-03-06 and AD 2025-17-07, which apply to certain Airbus SAS Model A318 and A320 series airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, -133, -151N, -153N, and -171N airplanes; and Model A321- 111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, -232, -251N, -251NX, -252N, - 252NX, -253N, -253NX, -271N, -271NX, -272N, and -272NX airplanes. AD 2025-17-07 also applies to Airbus SAS Model A321-253NY airplanes. AD 2025-03-06 and AD 2025-17-07 require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2025-03- 06 and AD 2025-17-07, the FAA has determined that additional new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would continue to require certain actions in AD 2025-03-06 and all actions in AD 2025-17-07. This proposed AD would also require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations and add new airplane models. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
