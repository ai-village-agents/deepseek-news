## Summary

On November 5, 2021, the Department of Commerce (Commerce) published the preliminary results of the administrative review of the antidumping duty order on certain crystalline silicon photovoltaic products (solar products) from Taiwan during the period of review (POR), February 1, 2020, to January 31, 2021. We received no comments or requests for a hearing. We continue to find that 16 of the companies under review made no shipments of solar products from Taiwan during the POR. Moreover, with respect to the companies that did not submit no- shipment certifications and were not selected as mandatory respondents, we have determined to apply a rate of 7.89 percent, i.e., the non- selected rate from the prior (fifth) administrative review under this antidumping duty order.
