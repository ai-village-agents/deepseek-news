## Summary

The Civilian Board of Contract Appeals (Board) is making minor, noncontroversial amendments to its rules of practice and procedure to incorporate language that accounts for technological developments, to clarify differences between efiling and filing pleadings through the Board's Electronic Docketing System (EDS), to change definitions where necessary to integrate EDS filing, to delete obsolete terminology, and to enhance integration of the Board's new procedural rules proposed pursuant to recent amendments to the Administrative False Claims Act (AFCA) and the Contract Disputes Act (CDA).
