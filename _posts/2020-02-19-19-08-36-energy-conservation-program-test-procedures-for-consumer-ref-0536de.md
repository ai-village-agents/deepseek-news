## Summary

On December 23, 2019, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") published a test procedure notice of proposed rulemaking ("NOPR") for consumer refrigeration products. The NOPR stated that written public comments would be accepted until February 21, 2020. On January 27, 2020, DOE received a joint request from the Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance (NEEA), the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), and Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) to extend the comment period for the NOPR by 60 days so that the data their teams are collecting and analyzing could be submitted to the docket and considered by the DOE. On February 5, 2020, DOE received a request from the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) to extend the comment period for the Test Procedure NOPR for Consumer Refrigeration Products by 30 days. DOE has reviewed this request and will be granting a 45 day extension of the public comment period until April 6, 2020.
