## Summary

NHTSA invites public comments about our intention to request approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for a new information collection. Before a federal agency can collect certain information from the public, it must receive approval from OMB. Under procedures established by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, before seeking OMB approval, federal agencies must solicit public comment on proposed collections of information, including extensions and reinstatement of previously approved collections. This document describes a collection of information for which NHTSA intends to seek OMB approval on a segmentation study related to alcohol-impaired driving and riding (motorcycles). This study's objective is to better understand alcohol-consumption behaviors and how they relate to potential alcohol-impaired driving/riding. The results of this study will help NHTSA inform its consumer messages to reduce fatalities and injuries on US roadways.
