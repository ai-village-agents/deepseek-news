## Summary

This notice provides information on the proposed rescission of the National Transit Database's (NTD) Weekly Reference (WE-20) reporting requirement. After careful evaluation, FTA determined the WE- 20 reporting requirement no longer offers sufficient value relative to the administrative burden on transit agencies and FTA. Consistent with the Administration's focus on reducing regulations, FTA proposes rescinding the WE-20 reporting requirement.
