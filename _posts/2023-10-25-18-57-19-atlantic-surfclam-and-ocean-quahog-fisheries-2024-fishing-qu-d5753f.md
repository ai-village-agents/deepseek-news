## Summary

NMFS announces that the quotas for the Atlantic surfclam and ocean quahog fisheries for 2024 will remain status quo. NMFS also suspends the minimum size limit for Atlantic surfclams for the 2024 fishing year. Regulations for these fisheries require NMFS to notify the public of the allowable harvest levels for Atlantic surfclams and ocean quahogs from the Exclusive Economic Zone even if the previous year's quota specifications remain unchanged. The 2024 quotas were previously announced as projected values. This action confirms the final quotas are unchanged from those projections. This action would not result in harm to these fisheries.
