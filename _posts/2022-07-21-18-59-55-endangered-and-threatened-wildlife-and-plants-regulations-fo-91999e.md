## Summary

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ("the Service") is rescinding the rule titled "Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Regulations for Designating Critical Habitat" that published on December 18, 2020, and became effective January 19, 2021. The rule set forth new regulations addressing how we exclude areas of critical habitat under section 4(b)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, outlining when and how the Service will undertake an exclusion analysis. This action removes the regulations established by that rule.
