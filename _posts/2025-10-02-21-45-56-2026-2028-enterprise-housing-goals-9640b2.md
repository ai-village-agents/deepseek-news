## Summary

The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is issuing a proposed rule and requesting comments on the housing goals for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the Enterprises) for 2026 through 2028 as required by the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992. The proposed rule establishes benchmark levels for the housing goals for 2026 through 2028. The proposed rule replaces the two area- based subgoals with one low-income areas subgoal, simplifies the goal determination process, clarifies inflation adjustments to maximum civil money penalties related to housing goals, and makes other technical changes.
