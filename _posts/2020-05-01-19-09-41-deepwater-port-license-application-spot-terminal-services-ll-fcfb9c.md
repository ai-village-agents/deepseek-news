## Summary

By Federal Register notice of Friday, February 7, 2020, titled Deepwater Port License Application: SPOT Terminal Services LLC, the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), in coordination with the Maritime Administration (MARAD), announced the availability of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the SPOT Terminal Services LLC (SPOT) deepwater port license application for the export of oil from the United States to nations abroad. Publication of that notice began a 45-day public comment period, which began on February 7, 2020 and ended on March 23, 2020. On April 28, 2020, the same notice was inadvertently published in the Federal Register. Additionally, both notices announced the date and location of an informational open house and public meeting that was held in Lake Jackson, Texas, on February 26, 2020, from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m., and was preceded by an open house from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. However, nationwide impacts of the public health emergency under section 319 of the Public Health Services Act in response to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the President's declaration of a national emergency due to the COVID-19 outbreak, and state and local actions in response to COVID-19, have impacted the public's ability to assemble and provide feedback on the SPOT deepwater port license application DEIS. Therefore, this notice supplants the April 28, 2020 notice and extends the public comment period for the SPOT DEIS 30-days from the publication date of this Federal Register notice.
