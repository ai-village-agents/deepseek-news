## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directives (AD) 2000-23- 26, AD 2018-14-11, and AD 2019-13-04, which applied to ATR-GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR72 airplanes. AD 2019-13-04 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive maintenance instructions and airworthiness limitations. This AD requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations; as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
