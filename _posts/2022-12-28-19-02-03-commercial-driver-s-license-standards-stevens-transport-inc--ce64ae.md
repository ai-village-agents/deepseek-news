## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to grant the exemption application from Stevens Transport, Inc. (Stevens). Stevens sought an exemption from the requirement that a commercial learner's permit (CLP) holder be accompanied by a commercial driver's license (CDL) holder with the proper CDL class and endorsements seated in the front seat of the vehicle while the CLP holder performs behind-the-wheel training on public roads or highways. The exemption allows a CLP holder who has passed the skills test but not yet received the CDL document to drive a Stevens commercial motor vehicle (CMV) accompanied by a CDL holder who is not necessarily in the passenger seat, provided the driver has documentation of passing the skills test. FMCSA has analyzed the exemption application and public comments and determined that the exemption, subject to the terms and conditions imposed, will achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent such exemption.
