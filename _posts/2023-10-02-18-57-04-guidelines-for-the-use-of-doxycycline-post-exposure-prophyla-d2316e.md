## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announces the opening of a docket to obtain comment on proposed guidelines for the use of doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for prevention of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STI). The proposed guidelines for bacterial STI prevention include post-exposure prophylaxis with doxycycline (doxycycline PEP) because it has demonstrated benefit in reducing chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis infections and represents a new approach to addressing STI prevention in populations at increased risk for these infections. Doxycycline PEP, when offered, should be implemented in the context of a comprehensive sexual health approach including risk reduction counseling, STI screening and treatment, recommended vaccination, and linkage to HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), HIV care, or other services, as appropriate. The purpose of the proposed guidelines is to provide updated clinical guidance for healthcare providers to inform the use of doxycycline PEP for preventing bacterial STI infections. CDC has made available a pre- recorded informational presentation to provide information about the studies considered when developing the proposed guideline, explain the public comment process, and provide an overview of important monitoring for antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance that the agency will be considering to address potential risks.
