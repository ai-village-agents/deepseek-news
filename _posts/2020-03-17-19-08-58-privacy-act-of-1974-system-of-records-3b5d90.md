## Summary

The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) proposes to add a System of Records titled, "Defense Repository for Common Enterprise Data (DRCED)," DUSDC 01. This system will automate financial and business transactions, perform cost-management analysis, produce oversight and audit reports, and provide critical data linking to improve performance of mission objectives. Congress mandated the creation of this system through the National Defense Authorization Act of 2018 and then codified it by statute as "Defense Business Systems: Business Process Reengineering; Enterprise Architecture; Management." The DRCED's purpose is to improve the Department's defense business enterprise by synchronizing and normalizing data for affordability, performance, and mission readiness. To achieve this, the DRCED will optimize technology to provide an enterprise solution for integrating and analyzing targeted data from existing Department systems to develop timely, actionable, and insightful conclusions in support of national strategies. Also, DRCED is capable of creating predictive analytic models based upon specific data streams to equip decision makers with critical data necessary for execution of fiscal and operational requirements.
