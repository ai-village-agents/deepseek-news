## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary security zone for certain waters of Lake Erie off Mentor Headlands Beach State Park, Mentor, Ohio. This action is necessary to provide offshore security for motion picture production activity on the Mentor Headlands Beach from June 17 through June 18, and June 20 through June 21, 2024. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from entering this security zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Sector Eastern Great Lakes or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
