## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish special local regulations for four annual marine events in the Captain of the Port (COTP), Delaware Bay Zone. This action is necessary to protect participants, spectators, and vessels from the hazards associated with the varying types of marine events. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the regulated areas during the enforcement period unless authorized by the COTP or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
