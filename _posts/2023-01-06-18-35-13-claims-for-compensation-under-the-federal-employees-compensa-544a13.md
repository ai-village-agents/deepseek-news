## Summary

The Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) is publishing this final rule to adjust the amount of time a claimant has to provide additional information when the evidence that has been submitted by the claimant is insufficient to meet their burden of proof and OWCP needs additional information. This change implements a requirement of the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023, which requires OWCP to increase the minimum amount of time allowed from 30 days to 60 days.
