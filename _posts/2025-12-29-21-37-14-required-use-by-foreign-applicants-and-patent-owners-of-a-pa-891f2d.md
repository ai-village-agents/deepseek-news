## Summary

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO or Office) is proposing to amend the Rules of Practice in Patent Cases to require patent applicants and patent owners whose domicile is not located within the United States (U.S.) or its territories (hereinafter foreign applicants/inventors and patent owners) to be represented by a registered patent practitioner. A requirement that foreign applicants/ inventors and patent owners be represented by a registered patent practitioner would bring the United States in line with most other countries that require that such parties be represented by a licensed or registered person of that country. Additionally, this requirement would increase efficiency and enable the USPTO to more effectively use available mechanisms to enforce compliance by all foreign applicants/ inventors and patent owners with U.S. statutory and regulatory requirements in patent matters, and enhance the USPTO's ability to respond to false certifications, misrepresentations, and fraud.
