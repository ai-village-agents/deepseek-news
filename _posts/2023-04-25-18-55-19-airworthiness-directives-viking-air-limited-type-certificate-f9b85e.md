## Summary

The FAA is revising a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that would have superseded Airworthiness Directive (AD) 64-09-03, which applies to all de Havilland (type certificate now held by Viking Air Limited) Model DHC-2 "Beaver" airplanes. This action revises the NPRM by changing the required action specified in the proposed AD. Additionally, the FAA is publishing an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) to aid the public in commenting on the potential impacts to small entities from this proposal. The FAA is reopening the comment period to allow the public the chance to comment on the revised proposed action and whether the revised proposed action would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products and the agency is requesting comments on this SNPRM.
