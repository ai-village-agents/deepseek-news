## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving several revisions to the New York State Implementation Plan (SIP) meant to result in emission reductions that will help attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter (PM) and ozone. These SIP revisions consist of amendments to several existing regulations outlined within New York's Codes, Rules, and Regulations that implement control measures for sources of PM and oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>). These actions are being taken in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
