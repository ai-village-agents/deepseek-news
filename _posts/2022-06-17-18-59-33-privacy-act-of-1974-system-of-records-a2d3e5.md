## Summary

This notice announces the Department of Commerce's (the Department) proposal to establish a new system of records entitled "COMMERCE/OIG-2, OIG Data Analytics Records," under the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-108, "Federal Agency Responsibilities for Review, Reporting, and Publication under the Privacy Act." This system of records will store individually identifying information gathered or created from existing systems of records maintained by the Department, other Department records, and private sources regarding or supporting Department operations. The new system will be used, primarily through data analytics techniques, to identify suspicious or fraudulent activity, internal control weaknesses, or otherwise to assist the Office of Inspector General (OIG) in the performance of its statutory duties under the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended. We invite public comment on the new system announced in this publication.
