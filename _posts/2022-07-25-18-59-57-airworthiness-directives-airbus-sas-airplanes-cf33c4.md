# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus SAS Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A300 F4-600R series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that the forward cargo door compartment between certain frame forks is susceptible to widespread fatigue damage (WFD). This proposed AD would complete certain mandated programs to support the airplane reaching its limit of validity (LOV) of the engineering data that support the established structural maintenance program. This proposed AD would require modifying the forward cargo compartment between certain frame forks, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
