## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to change the operating schedule that governs the Blackburn Point Bridge across the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway (GICW), mile 63.1, at Osprey, FL. The Casey Key Association has requested the Coast Guard consider changing the operating schedule to reduce drawbridge openings during the weekday peak traffic periods to assist with alleviating roadway congestion. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
