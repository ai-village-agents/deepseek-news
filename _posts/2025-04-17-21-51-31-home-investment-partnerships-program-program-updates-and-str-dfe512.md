## Summary

On January 6, 2025, HUD published the HOME Investment Partnerships Program: Program Updates and Streamlining final rule (HOME Final Rule) in the Federal Register, which was scheduled to take effect on February 5, 2025. On February 3, 2025, HUD delayed the effective date of the HOME Final Rule until April 20, 2025, consistent with the President's January 20, 2025, memorandum titled "Regulatory Freeze Pending Review." This publication announces that HUD is further delaying the effective or compliance dates for certain provisions of the HOME Final Rule. The provisions of the HOME Final Rule that are not further delayed by this publication are effective as of April 20, 2025.
