## Summary

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM, we) is issuing this direct final rule (DFR) to amend BLM regulations to extend the phase-in date for compliance with the minimum bond amount for Statewide oil and gas bonds. The current regulation requires operators to increase or replace existing Statewide bonds to meet the $500,000 minimum bond amount by June 22, 2026. This rule extends that deadline to June 22, 2027, aligning it with the phase-in date for individual lease bonds.
