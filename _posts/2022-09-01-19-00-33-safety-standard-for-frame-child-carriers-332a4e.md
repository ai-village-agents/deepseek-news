## Summary

In March 2015, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) published a consumer product safety standard for frame child carriers under section 104 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA). The standard incorporated by reference the ASTM voluntary standard for frame child carriers that had been adopted in 2014 and was in effect at the time. The CPSIA sets forth a process for updating mandatory standards for durable infant or toddler products that are based on a voluntary standard, when the voluntary standards organization revises the standard. Consistent with the CPSIA's update process, this direct final rule updates the mandatory standard for frame child carriers to incorporate by reference ASTM's 2022 version of the voluntary standard.
