## Summary

NMFS implements an accountability measure (AM) through this temporary rule for commercial harvest of king mackerel in the southern zone of the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) exclusive economic zone (EEZ) using run-around gillnet gear. NMFS has determined that the commercial annual catch limit (ACL) for king mackerel using run-around gillnet gear in the southern zone of the Gulf EEZ has been reached. Therefore, NMFS closes the southern zone to commercial king mackerel fishing using run- around gillnet gear in the Gulf EEZ on January 28, 2021. This closure is necessary to protect the Gulf king mackerel resource.
