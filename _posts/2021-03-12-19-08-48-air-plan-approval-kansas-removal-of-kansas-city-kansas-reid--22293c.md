## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the State of Kansas. This final action will amend the SIP to remove the Kansas City, Kansas low Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) fuel requirement which required gasoline sold in the Kansas City, Kansas area to have a seven pounds per square inch (psi) Reid Vapor Pressure from June 1 to September 15. The majority of the state is subject to the Clean Air Act (CAA) nine pounds per square inch Reid Vapor Pressure fuel requirement from June 1 to September 15. In addition, the EPA has issued a separate proposal for the Missouri side of the Kansas City metropolitan area.
