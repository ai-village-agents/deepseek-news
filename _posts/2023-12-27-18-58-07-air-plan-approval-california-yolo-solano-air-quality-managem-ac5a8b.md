## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve, through parallel processing, state implementation plan (SIP) revisions from the Yolo-Solano Air Quality Management District (YSAQMD or "District") to address Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act") requirements related to the 2008 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or "standards"). These revisions concern emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) from biomass boilers, and also address reasonably available control technology (RACT) requirements for major sources of NO<INF>X</INF> in the portion of the Sacramento Metro, CA, nonattainment area that is subject to YSAQMD jurisdiction. We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
