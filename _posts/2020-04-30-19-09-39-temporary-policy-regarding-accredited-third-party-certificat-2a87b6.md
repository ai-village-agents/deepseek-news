## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, Agency, or we) is announcing the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled "Temporary Policy Regarding Accredited Third-Party Certification Program Onsite Observation and Certificate Duration Requirements During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency." Given the public health emergency presented by COVID-19, this guidance document is being implemented without prior public comment because FDA has determined that prior public participation is not feasible or appropriate, but it remains subject to comment in accordance with the Agency's good guidance practices. The guidance communicates the Agency's intention not to enforce certain requirements for the onsite monitoring activities and certificates for the currently recognized accreditation bodies (ABs) and accredited third-party certification bodies (CBs) in the Accredited Third-Party Certification Program for human and animal food in certain circumstances. Because travel restrictions and advisories related to COVID-19 may impact the ability of recognized ABs and accredited CBs to conduct onsite activities, this guidance provides temporary flexibility so that recognized ABs can maintain the accreditations of their CBs, and so that already-issued certifications need not lapse, in certain circumstances.
