## Summary

On December 5, 2022, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) published a proposed rule to establish three danger zones in the waters of Carr Creek and Whitehall Bay in the vicinity of the Naval Support Activity Annapolis. The comment period ended on January 4, 2023. The Corps received numerous requests to extend the comment period, so we are reopening the comment period for 45 days. Comments previously submitted on the proposed rule do not need to be resubmitted, as they have already been incorporated into the administrative record and will be fully considered in the Corps' decision-making process for this rulemaking action.
