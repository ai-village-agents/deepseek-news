## Summary

DoD is finalizing eligibility requirements for ID cards issued to uniformed service members, their dependents, and other DoD individuals. These cards are used for proof of identity, DoD affiliation, and to facilitate accessing DoD benefits. This rule includes documentation requirements to address the modification of gender in a record consistent with the requirements of Executive Orders "Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation," and "Enabling All Qualified Americans To Serve Their Country In Uniform." The rule also updates the CFR to match the revised contents of various internal DoD policy issuances and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS).
