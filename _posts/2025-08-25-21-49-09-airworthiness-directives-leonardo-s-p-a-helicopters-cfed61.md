## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Leonardo S.p.A. Model A109A, A109A II, A109C, A109K2, and A119 helicopters and certain AW119 MKII helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of incorrect installation of the bolts that attach the pitch (longitudinal) actuator assembly and the roll (lateral) actuator assembly to their respective bellcrank assemblies of the cyclic control system. This AD requires inspecting the bolts for proper installation and, depending on the results, performing corrective actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
