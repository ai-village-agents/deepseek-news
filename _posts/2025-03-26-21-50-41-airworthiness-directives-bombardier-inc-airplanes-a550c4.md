## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-1A10 and BD-700-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that incorrect information was found in certain calculation tables in a section of the airplane flight manual (AFM) that addresses certain slat-flap conditions. This proposed AD would require revising the Non-Normal Procedures section of the existing AFM to provide the flightcrew with corrected procedures to use in certain slat-flap conditions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
