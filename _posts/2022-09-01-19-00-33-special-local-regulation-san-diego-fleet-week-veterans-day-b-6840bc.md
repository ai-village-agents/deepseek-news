## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to amend its special local regulations for recurring marine parades, regattas, and other events in Southern California Annual Marine Events for the San Diego Captain of the Port Zone. This proposed rule would add one new recurring special local regulation for the San Diego Fleet Week Veterans Day Boat Parade. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on the navigable waters during the annual event. This proposed rulemaking would restrict vessel traffic in the designated areas during the event unless authorized by the Captain of the Port San Diego or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
