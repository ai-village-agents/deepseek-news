## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily determines that, with the exception of the nine companies with no shipments, 14 companies under review sold subject merchandise at less than normal value during the period of review (POR), December 1, 2020, through November 30, 2021, and one did not sell merchandise below normal value. Commerce also preliminarily determines that 19 companies subject to this review are part of the China-wide entity because they did not demonstrate their eligibility for a separate rate. Additionally, Commerce is rescinding this review with respect to 11 companies. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results of review.
