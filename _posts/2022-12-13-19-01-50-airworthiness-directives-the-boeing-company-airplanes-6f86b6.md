## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of a loss of water pressure during flight and water leaks that affected multiple pieces of electronic equipment. This proposed AD would require a detailed visual inspection of all door 1 and door 3 lavatory and galley potable water systems for any missing or incorrectly installed clamshell couplings and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
