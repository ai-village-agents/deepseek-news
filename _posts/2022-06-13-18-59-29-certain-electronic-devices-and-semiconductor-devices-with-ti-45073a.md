## Summary

Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on April 22, 2022, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of Bell Semiconductor, LLC of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

The complaint, as supplemented, alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain electronic devices and semiconductor devices with timing-aware dummy fill and components thereof by reason of the infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 7,007,259 ("the '259 patent"). The complaint, as supplemented, further alleges that an industry in the United States exists as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The complainant requests that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a limited exclusion order and cease and desist orders.
