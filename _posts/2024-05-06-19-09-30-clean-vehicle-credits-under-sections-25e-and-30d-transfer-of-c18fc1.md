## Summary

This document contains final regulations regarding Federal income tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) for the purchase of qualifying new and previously-owned clean vehicles, including new and previously-owned plug-in electric vehicles powered by an electric battery meeting certain requirements and new qualified fuel cell motor vehicles. In addition, the final regulations provide guidance for taxpayers who purchase qualifying vehicles and intend to transfer the amount of any previously-owned clean vehicle credit or new clean vehicle credit to dealers that are entities eligible to receive advance payments of either credit. The final regulations also provide guidance for dealers to become eligible entities to receive advance payments of previously-owned clean vehicle credits or new clean vehicle credits, and rules regarding recapture of the credits. Finally, the final regulations provide guidance on the meaning of three new definitions added to the exclusive list of mathematical or clerical errors relating to certain assessments of tax without a notice of deficiency.
