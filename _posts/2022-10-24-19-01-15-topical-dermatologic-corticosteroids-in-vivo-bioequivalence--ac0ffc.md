## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled "Topical Dermatologic Corticosteroids: In Vivo Bioequivalence." This draft guidance is intended to assist applicants who submit abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) for topical dermatologic corticosteroid products of all potency groups (referred to in this notice as topical corticosteroids). The draft guidance describes recommendations for an in vivo pharmacodynamic approach to demonstrate the bioequivalence of topical corticosteroids. When finalized, this guidance will replace FDA's 1995 guidance for industry of the same name. Revising this guidance will provide clarity for potential ANDA applicants on the appropriate pilot and pivotal studies and other recommendations for pharmacodynamic approach to assess the bioequivalence of topical dermatologic corticosteroids. These recommendations have evolved since the original guidance was issued in 1995.
