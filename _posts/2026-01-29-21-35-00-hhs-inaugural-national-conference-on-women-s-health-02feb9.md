## Summary

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office on Women's Health announces an opportunity for non-Federal and private sector organizations and entities to co-sponsor the inaugural HHS National Conference on Women's Health. The conference will take place at the Omni Shoreham Hotel in Washington, DC, on March 11-13, 2026. The conference will address breakthroughs in research, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of health conditions that affect women across the lifespan. It will explore opportunities to bridge gaps between evidence and implementation and drive cross-sector innovation to modernize patient care and promote better health. The National Conference on Women's Health co-sponsorship will involve executing a series of financially self-sustaining meetings, events, and/or conference networking opportunities to convene women's health stakeholders and facilitate discussions on health topics that impact women and girls. HHS will be responsible for arranging and paying for conference facilities, logistics, and advertising. Co- sponsors will be responsible for developing programming for and managing logistics of co-sponsored meetings, events, and/or conference networking opportunities and shall consult with HHS and receive HHS approval prior to finalizing such opportunities. Co-sponsors will be responsible for paying for expenses related to and advertising the co- sponsored meetings, events, and/or conference networking opportunities. No federal funds will be provided to the co-sponsor. Registration fees will not be collected for the conference or co-sponsored activities. This co-sponsorship opportunity is not a grant or contract award, and each entity will be responsible for financially supporting its own activities. Potential co-sponsors must be capable of managing the day- to-day operations associated with the proposed activities in collaboration with the conference organizers and be willing to participate substantively in the execution of the co-sponsored activity(ies). Participation by co-sponsor(s) does not imply endorsement by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
