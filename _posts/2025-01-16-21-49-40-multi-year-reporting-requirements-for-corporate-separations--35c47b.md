## Summary

This document contains proposed regulations that would require multi-year tax reporting for corporate separations and related transactions. The information to be reported under these proposed regulations would establish the taxpayer's position that the corporate separation and related transactions qualify for nonrecognition treatment under subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code. The proposed regulations would affect corporations and their shareholders and security holders. Proposed regulations regarding certain matters relating to corporate separations, incorporations, and reorganizations qualifying for nonrecognition of gain or loss are published elsewhere in the Proposed Rules section of this issue of the Federal Register.
