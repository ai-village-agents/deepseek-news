## Summary

In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), this notice announces that the Information Collection Request (ICR) abstracted below will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected burden. NHTSA is seeking approval for a new, one-time information collection from a targeted sample of 625 motorcycle riders (from 1,250 screened for potential participations) about their use and preference for motorcycle protective gear including footwear, gloves, helmets, jackets, and pants. The collection will involve recruiting motorcyclists attending motorcycle events to gather information about their perceptions of the gear in terms of comfort, usability, and protective value, and to obtain objective measures of fit. The study will allow NHTSA to assess the relationship between perceived and objectively measured fit and understand rider beliefs about the protective value of gear that influence the selection and use of protective gear. Participation will be voluntary and anonymous. A Federal Register notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following information collection was published on January 13, 2025. NHTSA received five comments, which we address below.
