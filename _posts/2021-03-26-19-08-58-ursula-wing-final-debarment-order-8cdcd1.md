## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) debarring Ursula Wing for a period of 5 years from importing or offering for import any drug into the United States. FDA bases this order on a finding that Ms. Wing was convicted of one felony count under Federal law for conspiracy to defraud the United States. Ms. Wing was given notice of the proposed debarment and an opportunity to request a hearing to show why she should not be debarred within the timeframe prescribed by regulation. Ms. Wing failed to request a hearing. Ms. Wing's failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of her right to a hearing concerning this matter.
