## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Dassault Aviation Model FALCON 2000EX airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of the incorrect installation of the very high frequency omnidirectional range and localizer (VOR/LOC) antenna coupler. This AD requires implementing an operational limitation for Category (CAT) II and CAT III approaches, inspecting the VOR/LOC antenna coupler, and reinstalling the VOR/LOC antenna coupler if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
