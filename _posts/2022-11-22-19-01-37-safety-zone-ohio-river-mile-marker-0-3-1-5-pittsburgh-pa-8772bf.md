## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for the Ohio River mile marker 0.3-1.5. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters during drilling operations from November 28, 2022 until December 3, 2022. This rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the safety zone, create a slow speed/no wake zone and limit commercial traffic to one way passing unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Pittsburgh or a designated representative. The safety zone is needed to protect personnel and vessels from potential hazards created by working in the Ohio River channel.
