## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all H[eacute]licopt[egrave]res Guimbal Model Cabri G2 helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of a crack in a rotating scissor fitting. This AD requires an initial and repetitive inspections of certain rotating and non-rotating scissor fittings, and depending on the results, replacing the affected assembly. This AD also prohibits installing certain main rotor hubs (MRHs) and swashplate guides unless the initial inspection has been accomplished. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
