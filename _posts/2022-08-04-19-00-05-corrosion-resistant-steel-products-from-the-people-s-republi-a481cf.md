## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily determines that Metalco S.A. (Metalco), the sole company subject to this administrative review of the antidumping duty (AD) order on corrosion-resistant steel products (CORE) from the People's Republic of China (China), is part of the China-wide entity because it did not file a separate rate application (SRA). The period of review (POR) is July 1, 2020, through June 30, 2021. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.
