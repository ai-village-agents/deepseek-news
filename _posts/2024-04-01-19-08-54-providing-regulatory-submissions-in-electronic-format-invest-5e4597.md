## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled "Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format: IND Safety Reports." This guidance finalizes the draft guidance of the same name published on October 30, 2019, and describes the electronic format sponsors will be required to use when they electronically submit investigational new drug application (IND) safety reports to the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) or the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) for serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions, as required by FDA regulations. FDA is establishing the electronic format requirements described in this guidance under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). The requirements in the guidance will be effective 24 months after the date of publication (April 1, 2026). Certain sponsors will be required to submit the specified IND safety reports electronically to FDA using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) as structured data elements, which will provide sponsors with a reporting format that is consistent with the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E2B format guidelines and reporting requirements to other regulatory agencies.
