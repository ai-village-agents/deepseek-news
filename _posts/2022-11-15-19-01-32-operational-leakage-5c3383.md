## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing Regulatory Issue Summary (RIS) 2022-02, "Operational Leakage." This RIS clarifies the NRC staff's position on the NRC requirements for evaluation, control, and treatment of operational leakage in systems required to be operable by plant technical specifications (TS). This RIS is intended for all holders of operating licenses and combined licenses for nuclear power reactors, except those who have permanently ceased operations and have certified that fuel has been permanently removed from the reactor vessel. This RIS emphasizes that operational leakage must be addressed in the same manner as leakage detected during an American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel (BPV) Code, Section XI, pressure test. That is, when operational leakage is found in a system that is within the scope of ASME BPV Code, Section XI, and is required to be operable by plant TS, the component must be evaluated by the licensee for operability. Structural integrity determinations must be conducted in accordance with the applicable provisions of the original construction code, the ASME BPVC, Section XI, or otherwise addressed through authorized methods.
