## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Diamond Aircraft Industries GmbH (DAI) Model DA 42, DA 42 M-NG, and DA 42 NG airplanes. This AD was prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) issued by the aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI describes the unsafe condition as dissolved or detached fuel tank hose material entering the main fuel tank chambers, which could result in restricted fuel flow with consequent fuel starvation. This AD requires removing the fuel tank connection hoses from service and inspecting the fuel tank connection hoses for damage and detached rubber material. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
