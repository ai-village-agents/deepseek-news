The regulation at issue is the definition of "Gross Proceeds" in the rates and terms set forth through settlements in the BES I and BES II proceedings in 37 CFR 384.3(a), which is used when calculating royalty payments paid to SoundExchange, a collective for copyright owners, in relation to digital transmissions of sound recordings pursuant to the statutory license in 17 U.S.C. 112.
