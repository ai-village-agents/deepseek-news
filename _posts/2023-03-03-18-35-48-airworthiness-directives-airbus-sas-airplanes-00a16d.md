## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by an in-service inspection that found overhead storage compartment (OHSC) crash rods that were disconnected. This AD requires a one-time detailed inspection of the OHSC crash rods and, depending on findings, corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
