# Amendment of Class B Airspace Description; Atlanta, GA

**Published:** February 05, 2026 18:59 UTC

## Summary

This action amends the description of the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, GA, Class B airspace area by changing the reference for defining the center point of the airspace from the "Atlanta VORTAC" to a "Point of Origin." This action is required because the Atlanta VORTAC is scheduled for decommissioning. The Point of Origin is based on the same geographical coordinates as the Atlanta VORTAC; therefore, the change is editorial only and does not alter the currently charted boundaries, or altitudes, or the air traffic control (ATC) procedures for the Atlanta Class B airspace area.
