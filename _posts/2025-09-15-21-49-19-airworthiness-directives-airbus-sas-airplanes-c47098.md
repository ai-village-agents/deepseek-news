## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A318-111, -112, and -122; A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133; A320-211, -212, -214, -216, - 232, -233, -251N, -252N, -253N, -271N, -272N, and -273N; and A321-211, -212, -213, -231, -232, -251N, -252N, -253N, -271N, -272N, -251NX, - 252NX, -253NX, -271NX, -272NX airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by the detection of a deviation from the manufacturing process during a review of the cold working process in the assembly line. This proposed AD would require repetitive special detailed inspections (SDIs) and rototest or high frequency eddy current (HFEC) and rototest inspections of the affected fasteners and fastener holes, and applicable on- condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
