## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (Commission) modifies the cost recovery rules for funding two forms of internet-based telecommunications relay services (TRS)--video relay service (VRS) and internet Protocol Relay Service (IP Relay). The Commission expands the Interstate TRS Fund (TRS Fund or Fund) contribution base for support of those services to include intrastate as well as interstate end-user revenues of TRS Fund contributors. This action will ensure fair treatment of intrastate and interstate communications services and users in the funding of relay services.
