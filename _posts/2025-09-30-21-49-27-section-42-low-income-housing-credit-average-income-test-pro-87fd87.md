## Summary

This document contains final regulations setting forth recordkeeping and reporting requirements for the average income test for purposes of the low-income housing credit. If a building is part of a residential rental project that satisfies the average income test, the building may be eligible to earn low-income housing credits. These final regulations affect owners of low-income housing projects, State or local housing credit agencies that monitor compliance with the requirements for low-income housing credits, and, indirectly, tenants in low-income housing projects.
