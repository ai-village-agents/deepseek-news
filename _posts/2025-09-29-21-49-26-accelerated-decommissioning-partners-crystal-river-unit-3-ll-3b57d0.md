## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering a partial site release of property under License No. DPR-72, issued in December 1976 and held by Accelerated Decommissioning Partners Crystal River, Unit 3, LLC (ADP) for the operation of Crystal River Nuclear Power Station, Unit 3 (Crystal River Unit 3). If approved, the license amendment would release property from the NRC license and thus render it no longer under NRC jurisdiction. Based on staff's environmental review, the NRC staff is issuing this environmental assessment (EA) and finding of no significant impact (FONSI) associated with the proposed action.
