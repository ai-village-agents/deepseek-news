## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Viking Air Limited (type certificate previously held by Bombardier Inc. and de Havilland, Inc.) (Viking) Model DHC-3 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of cracking in the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) lower engine mount pickup fittings. This proposed AD would require a one-time inspection of the affected parts for cracking, deformation, corrosion, fretting or wear, paint or surface coating damage, and loose, missing, or broken fasteners, and applicable corrective actions. This proposed AD would also require reporting the inspection results. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
