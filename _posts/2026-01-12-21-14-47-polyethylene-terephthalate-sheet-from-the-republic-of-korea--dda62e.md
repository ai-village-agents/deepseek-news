## Summary

On August 1, 2025, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) initiated the first sunset review of the antidumping duty (AD) order on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sheet from the Republic of Korea (Korea). Because no domestic party responded to the sunset review notice of initiation by the applicable deadline, consistent with section 751(c)(3)(A) of the Tarriff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), Commerce is revoking the AD order on polyethylene terephthalate sheet from Korea.
