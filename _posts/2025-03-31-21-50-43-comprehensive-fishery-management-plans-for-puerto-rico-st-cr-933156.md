## Summary

NMFS corrects the final rule that implemented management measures described in the Puerto Rico, St. Croix, and St. Thomas and St. John Fishery Management Plans (collectively, island-based FMPs), which published in the Federal Register on September 13, 2022. Among other measures, the final rule revised species tables in Appendix A to part 622 and inadvertently removed banded rudderfish from the South Atlantic snapper-grouper species table. The purpose of this correcting amendment is to fix this inadvertent error.
