## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving three elements of a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision, which was submitted by the State of Rhode Island on December 6, 2017. This revision addressed the infrastructure requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act) for the 2012 annual fine particle (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). On May 31, 2022, EPA approved much of the submission, but did not act on three elements related to the infrastructure requirement to have a comprehensive Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program. In today's action, EPA is approving the three remaining elements of the state's December 2017 infrastructure SIP submittal based on a previous EPA approval of Rhode Island's Air Pollution Control Regulation (APCR) No. 9. This action is being taken in accordance with the Clean Air Act.
