# Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of under-torqued and missing nuts on the horizontal stabilizer trim actuator (HSTA) lower gimbal assembly. This proposed AD would require a review of maintenance records to determine if an overhauled HSTA was inspected and corrective actions were accomplished using certain service information, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
