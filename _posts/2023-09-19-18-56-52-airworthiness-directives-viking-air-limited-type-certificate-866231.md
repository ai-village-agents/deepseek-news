## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Viking Air Limited (Viking) (type certificate previously held by Bombardier Inc. and de Havilland, Inc.) Model DHC-3 airplanes. This AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI describes the unsafe condition as corrosion, wear, and fatigue-related degradation in aging aircraft. This AD requires incorporating into the existing maintenance records for your airplane the actions and associated thresholds and intervals, including life limits, specified in a supplemental inspection and corrosion control manual for Model DHC-3 airplanes. This AD also requires completing all the initial tasks identified in this manual and reporting corrosion findings to Viking. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
