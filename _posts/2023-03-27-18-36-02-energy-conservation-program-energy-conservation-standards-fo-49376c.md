## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is initiating an effort to determine whether to amend the current energy conservation standards for fluorescent lamp ballasts ("FLB"). Under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended, DOE must review these standards no later than three years after making a determination that standards for the product do not need to be amended and publish either a notice of proposed rulemaking ("NOPR") to propose new standards for FLB or a notification of determination that the existing standards do not need to be amended. DOE is soliciting the public for information to help determine whether the current standards require amending under the applicable statutory criteria. DOE welcomes written comments from the public on any subject within the scope of this document, including topics not specifically raised.
