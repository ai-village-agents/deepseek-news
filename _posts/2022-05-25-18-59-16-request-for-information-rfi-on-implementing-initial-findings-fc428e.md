## Summary

The Office of Science and Technology Policy and the National Science Foundation are seeking comment on the initial findings and recommendations contained in the interim report of the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) Task Force ("Task Force") and particularly on potential approaches to implement those recommendations. The Task Force has been directed by Congress to develop an implementation roadmap for a shared research infrastructure that would provide artificial intelligence (AI) researchers and students with access to computational resources, high-quality data, training tools, and user support. Comments in response to this RFI will inform the development of the Task Force's final report, which is expected to be released in December 2022.
