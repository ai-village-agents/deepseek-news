## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is amending the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) to reflect a court order regarding the General Provisions for National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) issued on December 19, 2008, by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the court). The court vacated two provisions in the General Provisions that exempted sources from hazardous air pollutant (HAP) non-opacity and opacity emission standards during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM). The court held that under the Clean Air Act (CAA), emissions standards or limitations must be continuous in nature and that the SSM exemptions in these two provisions violate this requirement. This ministerial action revises these two NESHAP General Provisions in the CFR to conform to the court's order.
