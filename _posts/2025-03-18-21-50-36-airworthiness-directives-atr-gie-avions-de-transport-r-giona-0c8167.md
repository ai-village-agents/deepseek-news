## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all ATR--GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42 and ATR72 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of a manufacturing defect identified in the lavatory fire extinguisher. This defect could potentially result in leakage at the eutectic tip, leading to a loss of pressure in the cylinder, making fire extinguishing capabilities ineffective. This AD requires an inspection (i.e., weight check) and replacement, as applicable, of certain lavatory compartment fire extinguishers, and also prohibits the installation of affected parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference (IBR). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
