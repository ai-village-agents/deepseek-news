## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-03- 05, which applied to all The Boeing Company Model 747-8F and 747-8 series airplanes and Model 777 airplanes. AD 2022-03-05 required revising the limitations section of the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to incorporate limitations prohibiting dispatching or releasing to airports, and approaches or landings on runways, when in the presence of interference from wireless broadband operations in the 3.7- 3.98 GHz frequency band (5G C-Band) as identified by Notices to Air Missions (NOTAMs). Since the FAA issued AD 2022-03-05, the FAA determined that additional limitations are needed due to the continued deployment of new 5G C-Band stations whose signals are expected to cover most of the contiguous United States at transmission frequencies between 3.7-3.98 GHz. This AD requires revising the limitations section of the existing AFM to incorporate limitations prohibiting dispatching or releasing to airports, and approaches or landings on runways, due to the presence of 5G C-Band interference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
