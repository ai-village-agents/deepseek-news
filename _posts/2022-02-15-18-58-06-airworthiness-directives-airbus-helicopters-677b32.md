## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model AS332L2 and EC225LP helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of loss of tightening torque on the nut that attaches the tail gear box (TGB) bevel wheel. This AD requires repetitive inspections (measurements) of the angular clearances of the TGB, and, depending on the findings, replacement of the TGB with a serviceable TGB, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also provides terminating action for certain repetitive inspections. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
