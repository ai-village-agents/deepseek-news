## Summary

By this final rule, the Census Bureau is removing its regulations governing the cutoff dates for the recognition of boundary changes for the 2010 Census. This action is necessary because the regulations pertain exclusively to the 2010 Decennial Census and are therefore obsolete, serving no current administrative or public purpose. The intended effect is to streamline the Code of Federal Regulations and reduce potential confusion for the public by removing outdated provisions.
