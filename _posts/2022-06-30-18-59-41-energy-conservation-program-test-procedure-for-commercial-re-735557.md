## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") proposes to amend the test procedures for commercial refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers to reference the latest versions of the applicable industry standards. DOE also proposes to establish definitions and test procedures for new equipment categories, adopt test procedures consistent with recently published waivers and interim waivers, establish product-specific enforcement provisions, allow for volume determinations based on computer aided designs, specify a sampling plan for volume and total display area, and adopt additional clarifying amendments. DOE is seeking comment from interested parties on the proposal.
