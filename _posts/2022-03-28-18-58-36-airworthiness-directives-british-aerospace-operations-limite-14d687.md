## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-15-06, which applies to British Aerospace Regional Aircraft Model HP.137 Jetstream Mk.1, Jetstream Series 200 and 3101, and Jetstream Model 3201 airplanes. AD 2017-15-06 requires repetitively inspecting the main landing gear (MLG) for cracks and, if cracks are found, replacing the MLG with an airworthy part. Since the FAA issued AD 2017- 15-06, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) of the United Kingdom superseded the mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) issued by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to correct an unsafe condition on these products. This proposed AD would retain the initial inspection and the calculation of hours time-in-service to flight cycle (FC) actions required by AD 2017-15-06, but would decrease the repetitive inspection interval time from 1,200 flight cycles to 900 flight cycles. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
