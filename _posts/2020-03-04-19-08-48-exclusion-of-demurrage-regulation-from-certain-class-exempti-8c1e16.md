## Summary

The Surface Transportation Board (STB or Board) is adopting a final rule amending its regulations governing the class exemptions for the rail transportation of certain miscellaneous commodities and rail transportation by boxcar to state more clearly that the exemptions do not apply to the regulation of demurrage. The final rule also revokes, in part, the class exemption that currently covers the rail transportation of certain agricultural commodities so that the exemption will not apply to the regulation of demurrage, thereby making the agricultural commodities exemption consistent with similar class exemptions covering non-intermodal rail transportation.
