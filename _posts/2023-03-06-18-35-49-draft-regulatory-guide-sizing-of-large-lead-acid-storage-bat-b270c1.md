## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing for public comment a draft regulatory guide (DG), DG-1418, "Sizing of Large Lead-Acid Storage Batteries." This DG is proposed Revision 2 of Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.212 of the same name. DG-1418 describes an approach that is acceptable to the NRC staff to meet regulatory requirements for sizing of large lead-acid storage batteries for production and utilization facilities. It endorses, with clarifications, the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) Standard 485-2020, "IEEE Recommended Practice for Sizing Lead- Acid Batteries for Stationary Applications."
