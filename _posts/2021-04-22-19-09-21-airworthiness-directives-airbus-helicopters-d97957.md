## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Helicopters Model AS332C, AS332C1, AS332L, and AS332L1 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a yaw control failure that was the result of the disconnection of the tail rotor hub (TRH) pitch control rod from the tail rotor servo-control, which resulted from a seized TRH bearing. The TRH bearing had grease dissolving after contamination by leaked hydraulic fluid from the tail rotor servo-control that came through the TRH assembly boot. This proposed AD would require repetitive inspections for hydraulic leaks, corrective actions if necessary, and an optional modification which constitutes terminating action, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
