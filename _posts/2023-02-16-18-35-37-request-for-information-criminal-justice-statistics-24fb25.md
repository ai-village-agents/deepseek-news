## Summary

Executive Order, Advancing Effective, Accountable Policing and Criminal Justice Practices to Enhance Public Trust and Public Safety, states that building trust in policing and criminal justice requires "transparency through data collection and public reporting." The Executive Order calls for issuing a report to the President on the current data collection, use, and data transparency practices with respect to law enforcement activities. This includes data related to calls for service, searches, stops, frisks, seizures, arrests, complaints, law enforcement demographics, and civil asset forfeiture. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), on behalf of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) and in coordination with the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, is requesting public input to inform this report.
