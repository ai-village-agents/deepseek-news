## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for navigable waters within 550-yards of a near shore construction site near the State Military Reservation, in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The safety zone will protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards created by subsurface construction. Operations are planned to bore tunnels to carry electric transmission lines below the Atlantic Ocean. When the M/V RAM XII or the M/V RAM XV are present, entry of vessels or persons into this zone is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port, Sector Virgina or a designated representative.
