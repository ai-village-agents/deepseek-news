## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a special local regulation on the navigable waters of the East River and New York Harbor, New York, NY, for vessel management for the annual 4th of July fireworks displays. This special local regulation allows the Coast Guard to control vessel movement and prohibit all vessel traffic from entering the fireworks barge buffer zone, establish four separate viewing areas, and a moving protection zone around the barges while they are loaded with pyrotechnics. This rule is necessary to provide for the safety of life on the navigable waters immediately before, during, and after a fireworks display that involves multiple barge launch sites on a highly congested waterway. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
