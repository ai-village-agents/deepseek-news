## Summary

The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is correcting a final rule, Expansion of Nuclear Nonproliferation Controls on the People's Republic of China and Macau, that appeared in the Federal Register on August 14, 2023. That rule intended to amend the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by adding additional nuclear nonproliferation controls on China and Macau. There was an inadvertent error in one of the regulatory instructions for that rule; this final rule corrects that inadvertent error.
