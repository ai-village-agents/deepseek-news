## Summary

To comply with a court order, the Federal Subsistence Board (Board) must initiate regulatory proceedings to identify those submerged lands within the Tongass National Forest that did not pass to the State of Alaska at statehood and, therefore, remain Federal public lands subject to Federal subsistence provisions. This proposed rule would add to the list of submerged parcels in the Federal subsistence regulations that have been identified through agency review. The purpose of this proposed rule is to complete regulatory proceedings addressing submerged public lands within the Tongass National Forest, as directed by the Court, and will result in increased subsistence harvest opportunities for rural Alaskans.
