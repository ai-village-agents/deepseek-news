## Summary

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks comments on the Draft Interagency Guidance Framework for Considering the Exercise of March-In Rights, which reviews the factors that an agency may consider when deciding whether to exercise march-in rights. NIST requests information from the public on the proposed version of this guidance document to ensure that it is clear, and its application will both fulfill the purpose of march-in rights and uphold the policy and objectives of the Bayh-Dole Act. The information received in response to this RFI will inform NIST and the Interagency Working Group for Bayh-Dole (IAWGBD) in developing a final framework document that may be used by an agency when making a march-in decision. NIST will hold at least one informational webinar explaining the Draft Interagency Guidance Framework for Considering the Exercise of March-In Rights and how the public can submit comments. Details about the informational webinar(s), including dates, times and any registration requirements, will be announced at https:// www.nist.gov/tpo/policy-coordination/bayh-dole-act.
