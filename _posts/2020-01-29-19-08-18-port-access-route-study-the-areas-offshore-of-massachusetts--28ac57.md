## Summary

From March 26, 2019 through December 15, 2019, the Coast Guard conducted The Areas Offshore of Massachusetts and Rhode Island Port Access Route Study and is now requesting your comments on a draft version of the study report. The goal of the study is to enhance navigational safety in the study area by examining existing shipping routes and waterway uses. To accomplish this goal, the Coast Guard has undertaken measures to determine what, if any, navigational safety concerns currently exist with vessel transits, examine existing shipping routes and waterway uses, and evaluate the need for establishing vessel routing measures in light of current and anticipated future demands associated with offshore wind leases in the Massachusetts and Rhode Island Wind Energy Area. A draft version of the report is available in the docket for viewing. We seek your comments on the content and development of the report.
