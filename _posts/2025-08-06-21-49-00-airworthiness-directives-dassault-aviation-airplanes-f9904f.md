## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-12-10, which applies to certain Dassault Aviation Model FALCON 7X airplanes. AD 2022-12-10 requires revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to provide emergency procedures for inconsistent or unreliable flight data, emergency and abnormal operations procedures for the generic input/output (GEN I/O) internal module failure, and emergency procedures for additional information. AD 2022-12-10 also requires revising the existing minimum equipment list (MEL) for the multi-function probe heating, air data, and inertial reference systems. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-12-10, the manufacturer developed modifications that fix a weak point in the avionics architecture. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2022-12-10 and would remove certain airplanes from the applicability. This proposed AD would also require modification of the avionics system and related revisions to the existing AFM and MEL. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
