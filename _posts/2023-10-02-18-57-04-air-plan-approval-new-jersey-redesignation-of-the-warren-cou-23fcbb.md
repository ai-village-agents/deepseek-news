## Summary

On November 15, 2021, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) submitted a request for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to approve the redesignation of the New Jersey portion of the Northeast Pennsylvania-Upper Delaware Valley Interstate Air Quality Control Region (Warren County, New Jersey) from nonattainment to attainment for the 1971 Sulfur Dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). In conjunction with its redesignation request, NJDEP submitted a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision containing a limited maintenance plan and its associated contingency measures for the Warren County 1971 SO<INF>2</INF> Nonattainment Area (Warren County SO<INF>2</INF> NAA) to ensure that attainment of the SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS will continue to be maintained. The EPA is taking final action to approve the requested SIP revision and to redesignate the Warren County SO<INF>2</INF> NAA from nonattainment to attainment for the 1971 SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS.
