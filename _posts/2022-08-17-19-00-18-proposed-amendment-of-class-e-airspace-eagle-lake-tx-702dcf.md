## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace at Eagle Lake, TX. The FAA is proposing this action due to an airspace review conducted as part of the decommissioning of the Eagle Lake very high frequency (VHF) omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimal Operational Network (MON) Program. The geographic coordinates of the airport would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
