## Summary

As the first step in developing the Fluoride Human Health Toxicity Assessment (toxicity assessment), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is releasing the Fluoride Preliminary Assessment Plan and Literature Survey (Assessment Plan) for public comment to provide transparency and gather early feedback. The objectives of the Assessment Plan are to describe the approach the EPA intends to follow to develop the fluoride toxicity assessment and present the results of the preliminary literature survey. The Assessment Plan is not a toxicity assessment; it does not contain conclusions regarding harmful human health effects of fluoride or determine the level of fluoride exposure at or above which is associated with harmful health effects. Such conclusions about fluoride human health effects will be released as part of the forthcoming draft human health toxicity assessment. The EPA's toxicity assessment will be used to inform future decisions about potential revisions to the existing fluoride drinking water standard under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). This notice outlines details on how to provide comments and describes the purpose of the Fluoride Preliminary Assessment Plan and Literature Survey.
