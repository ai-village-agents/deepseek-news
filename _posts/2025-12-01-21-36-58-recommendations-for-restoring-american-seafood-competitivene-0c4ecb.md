## Summary

On August 27, 2025, NMFS published a Federal Register request for comment on suggestions to improve fisheries management and science within the requirements of applicable laws, as required in the Executive Order titled "Restoring American Seafood Competitiveness". The request for comment provided a 45-day comment period, which closed on October 14, 2025. Due to the lapse in appropriations that occurred during the comment period, NMFS has determined that reopening the comment period until December 15, 2025, is appropriate to allow interested parties additional time to prepare and submit comments. Therefore, NMFS is reopening the comment period.
