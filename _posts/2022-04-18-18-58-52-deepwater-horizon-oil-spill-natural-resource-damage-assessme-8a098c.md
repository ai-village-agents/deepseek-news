## Summary

In accordance with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), the Final Programmatic Damage Assessment Restoration Plan and Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (Final PDARP/PEIS), and Consent Decree, the Federal and State natural resource trustee agencies for the Florida Trustee Implementation Group (FL TIG) have prepared the Draft Phase V.4 Florida Coastal Access Project: Restoration Plan and Supplemental Environmental Assessment (Phase V.4 RP/SEA). The FL TIG is proposing a fourth phase of the Florida Coastal Access Project. The preferred alternative includes the acquisition of the Dickerson Bay parcel: A 114-acre undeveloped coastal inholding in Wakulla County, Florida, within the approved boundary of St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge (NWR). This would continue the process of restoring lost recreational use in the Florida Restoration Area resulting from the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill. We invite comments on the Draft Phase V.4 RP/ SEA.
