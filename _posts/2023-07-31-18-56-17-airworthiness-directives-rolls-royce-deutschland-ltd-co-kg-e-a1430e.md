## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Model Trent 1000-A2, Trent 1000-AE2, Trent 1000-C2, Trent 1000-CE2, Trent 1000-D2, Trent 1000-E2, Trent 1000-G2, Trent 1000-H2, Trent 1000-J2, Trent 1000-K2, and Trent 1000-L2 engines. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of cracking and separation of certain low-pressure turbine (LPT) stage 1 blade assemblies. This proposed AD would require initial and repetitive inspections of affected LPT stage 1 blade assemblies for cracking or separation and, depending on the results of the inspections, reduction of the inspection interval or replacement of the LPT stage 1 blade set and disk, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
