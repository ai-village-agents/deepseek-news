## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) AD 2021-16-07, which applies to certain Airbus Defense and Space S.A. Model C-212-CB, C-212-CC, C-212-CD, C-212-CE, C-212-CF, C-212-DE, and C-212-DF airplanes. AD 2021-16-07 requires repetitive inspections of the left-hand (LH) and right-hand (RH) side center wing fairings at a certain frame, around the wing leading edge for discrepancies (cracks), and repair if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-16-07, a modification was developed to reinforce the structure in the affected area, providing an optional terminating action for the repetitive inspections required by AD 2021-16-07. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2021-16-07 and would allow new optional terminating action for the repetitive inspections, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
