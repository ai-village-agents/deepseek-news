## Summary

This action proposes to amend three Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways and two United States Area Navigation (RNAV) routes; and to revoke two VOR Federal airways and three jet routes in the eastern United States. The FAA is taking this action due to the planned decommissioning of the Elmira, NY (ULW), VOR/ Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME). This action is in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program.
