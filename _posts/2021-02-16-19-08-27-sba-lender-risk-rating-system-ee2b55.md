## Summary

This notice implements changes to the Small Business Administration's (SBA's) Risk Rating System. The Risk Rating System is an internal tool to assist SBA in assessing the risk of the SBA loan operations and loan portfolio of each active 7(a) Lender and Certified Development Company (CDC). Consistent with industry best practices, SBA recently redeveloped the model used to calculate the composite Risk Ratings of lenders and the risk associated with each SBA loan to ensure that the Risk Rating System remains current and predictive as technologies, the economy, and available data evolve. In conjunction with the redevelopment of the Lender Risk Rating, SBA is updating the Lender Portal and its definition for Confidential Information. SBA is publishing this notice with a request for comments to provide the public with an opportunity to comment.
