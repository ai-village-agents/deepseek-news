## Summary

Texas has scheduled a special election on November 4, 2025, to fill the U.S. House of Representatives seat in the 18th Congressional District held by the late Representative Sylvester Turner. There are two possible elections, but only one may be necessary. Under Texas law, all qualified candidates, regardless of party affiliation, will appear on the ballot. The majority winner of the Special General Election is declared elected. Should no candidate achieve a majority vote, the Governor will then set the date for a Special Runoff Election that will include only the top two vote-getters. Committees participating in the Texas special election are required to file pre- and post-election reports.
