## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Leonardo S.p.A. Model AB412 and AB412 EP helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of a cracked left upper cap angle (cap angle) having a certain part-number. This AD requires repetitively inspecting the cap angle and, depending on the results, performing corrective actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
