## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Helicopters Model SA341G and SA342J helicopters. This AD was prompted by the determination that a new life limit was necessary for certain tail rotor blades (TRBs). This AD requires replacing certain TRBs, re-identifying certain TRBs, and repairing certain other TRBs, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
