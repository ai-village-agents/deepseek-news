## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Piaggio Aero Industries S.p.A. (Piaggio) Model P-180 airplanes. This AD is prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as altimetry system errors in the air data computers (ADCs) and stand-by instrument systems. This AD requires amending the existing airplane flight manual (AFM), installing improved ADCs and a detachable configuration module (DCM), and revising the existing instructions for continued airworthiness. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
