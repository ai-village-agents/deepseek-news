## Summary

GSA Bulletin FTR 23-08, Waiver of certain Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) provisions for official relocation travel to locations in Florida and South Carolina impacted by Hurricane Idalia, informs Federal agencies that certain provisions of the FTR governing official relocation travel are temporarily waived for Florida and South Carolina locations impacted by Hurricane Idalia. As a result of the storm damage caused by Hurricane Idalia, agencies should consider delaying all non- essential relocations to the affected areas given the statutory 120-day maximum for payment of temporary quarters subsistence expenses (TQSE). Due to the lasting effects of the storm damage to these affected areas, finding lodging facilities and/or adequate meals may be difficult, and distance involved may be great, resulting in increased cost for relocation subsistence expenses.
