## Summary

The FHWA is proposing to discontinue its general waiver of Buy America requirements for manufactured products and in doing so require FHWA recipients to start applying Buy America requirements to manufactured products. The FHWA is also proposing standards for applying Buy America to manufactured products should the waiver be discontinued. The proposed standards for applying Buy America to manufactured products are consistent with the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) guidance implementing the Build America, Buy America Act (BABA) provisions of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL)).
