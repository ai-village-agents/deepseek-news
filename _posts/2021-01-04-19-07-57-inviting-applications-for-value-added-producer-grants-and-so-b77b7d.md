## Summary

The Rural Business-Cooperative Service (Agency), USDA published a notice in the Federal Register of December 21, 2020 regarding acceptance of applications for the Value-Added Producer Grant (VAPG) Program. This document inadvertently listed two incorrect amounts of available funds and omitted the option for the applicants to submit applications via electronic mail. This notice corrects these errors.
