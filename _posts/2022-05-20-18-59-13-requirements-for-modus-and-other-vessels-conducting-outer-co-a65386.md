## Summary

The Coast Guard is withdrawing the proposed rule entitled "Requirements for MODUs and Other Vessels Conducting Outer Continental Shelf Activities with Dynamic Positioning Systems" published on November 28, 2014. We are taking this action because there have been changes in the industry in the past 7 years, including new standards and technologies, and the rule we proposed in 2014 is no longer appropriate in light of those changes. The Coast Guard may issue a new rulemaking in the future if warranted.
