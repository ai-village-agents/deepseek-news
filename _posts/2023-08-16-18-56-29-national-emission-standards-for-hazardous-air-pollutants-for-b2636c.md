# National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Coke Ovens: Pushing, Quenching, and Battery Stacks, and Coke Oven Batteries; Residual Risk and Technology Review, and Periodic Technology Review

## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing amendments to the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Coke Ovens: Pushing, Quenching, and Battery Stacks (PQBS) source category, and the NESHAP for the Coke Oven Batteries (COB) source category. This proposal presents the results of the residual risk and technology review (RTR) conducted as required under the Clean Air Act (CAA) for the PQBS source category, and the periodic technology review for the COB source category, also required under the CAA. The EPA is proposing that risks due to emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from the PQBS source category are acceptable and that the current NESHAP provides an ample margin of safety to protect public health. Under the technology review for PQBS NESHAP, we are proposing there are no developments in practices, processes or control technologies that necessitate revision of standards for this source category. Under the technology review for the COB source category, the EPA is proposing amendments to the NESHAP to lower the limits for leaks from doors, lids, and offtakes to reflect improvements in technology to minimize emissions. We also are proposing a requirement for fenceline monitoring for benzene (as a surrogate for coke oven emissions) and a requirement to conduct root cause analysis and corrective action upon exceeding an action level. In addition, we are proposing: (1) new standards for several unregulated HAP or sources of HAP at facilities subject to PQBS NESHAP; (2) the removal of exemptions for periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction consistent with a 2008 court decision, and clarifying that the standards apply at all times for both source categories; and (3) the addition of electronic reporting for performance test results and compliance reports. We solicit comments on all aspects of this proposed action.
