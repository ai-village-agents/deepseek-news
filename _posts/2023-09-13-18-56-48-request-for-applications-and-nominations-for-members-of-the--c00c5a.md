## Summary

The Federal Housing Finance Agency is seeking individuals to serve on the Advisory Committee on Affordable, Equitable, and Sustainable Housing (Committee). It is estimated that the Committee will meet at least twice annually to advise FHFA regarding affordable, equitable, and sustainable housing. Recommendations by the Committee help inform FHFA's perspective on regulatory, guidance, or policy changes that may be necessary to expand affordable, equitable, and sustainable housing, with a focus on FHFA's regulated entities and their respective roles in providing a reliable source of liquidity and funding for housing finance and community investment including both single-family and multifamily housing.
