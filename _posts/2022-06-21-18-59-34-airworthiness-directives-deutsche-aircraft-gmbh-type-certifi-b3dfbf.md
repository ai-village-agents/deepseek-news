## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Deutsche Aircraft GmbH (Type Certificate Previously Held by 328 Support Services GmbH; AvCraft Aerospace GmbH; Fairchild Dornier GmbH; Dornier Luftfahrt GmbH) Model 328-100 and -300 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a safety analysis that lithium batteries installed in the personal electronic devices (PED) are a potential risk of an in- flight fire in the flight deck stowage boxes. This proposed AD would require installing a placard and stowing the fire gloves on the left- hand (LH) flap door of the flight deck step; and installing the placards on the LH and right-hand (RH) flight deck stowage boxes. This proposed AD would also require revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to include emergency procedures, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
