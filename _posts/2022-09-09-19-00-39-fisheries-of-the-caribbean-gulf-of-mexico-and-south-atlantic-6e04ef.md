## Summary

The South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council) submitted Amendment 50 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Snapper- Grouper Fishery of the South Atlantic (FMP) for review, approval, and implementation by NMFS. If approved by the Secretary of Commerce, Amendment 50 to the FMP would establish a new rebuilding plan, revise the acceptable biological catch (ABC), annual optimum yield (OY), annual catch limits (ACLs), sector allocations, recreational accountability measures (AMs), and additional management measures for red porgy. The additional management measures would address commercial seasonal quotas, commercial trip limits, recreational bag and possession limits, and a recreational fishing season for red porgy. The purpose of Amendment 50 is to end overfishing of red porgy, rebuild the stock, and achieve OY while minimizing, to the extent practicable, adverse social and economic effects.
