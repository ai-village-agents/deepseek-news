## Summary

FMCSA reopens the comment period for its January 24, 2022, NPRM concerning the fees to be collected by the Unified Carrier Registration (UCR) Plan and Agreement for the 2023 year and subsequent registration years. FMCSA received a request for a reopening of the comment period from the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association (OOIDA). The Agency finds it is appropriate to reopen the comment period to provide interested parties an opportunity to review comments OOIDA included with its request to reopen the comment period, and certain information provided by the UCR Board in response to a request from FMCSA, after February 23, 2022, the previous deadline for public comments. Therefore, the Agency reopens the record for the submission of comments for 14 days for the limited purpose of allowing comments on the UCR Plan's response.
