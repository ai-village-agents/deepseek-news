## Summary

In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), this notice announces that the Information Collection Request (ICR) summarized below will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected burden. NHTSA invites public comments about our intention to request approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for a reinstatement with modification of a previously approved information collection request exploring older drivers' use of rearview video systems (backing cameras). A Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following information collection was published. NHTSA received comments from one organization, which we address below.
