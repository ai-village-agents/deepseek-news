## Summary

In accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), the OCC, the Board, and the FDIC (the agencies) may not conduct or sponsor, and the respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), of which the agencies are members, has approved the agencies' publication for public comment of a proposal to revise and extend the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Reports) (FFIEC 031, FFIEC 041, and FFIEC 051), which are currently approved collections of information. The FFIEC has also approved the Board's publication for public comment, on behalf of the agencies, of a proposal to revise and extend the Report of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks (FFIEC 002) and the Report of Assets and Liabilities of a Non- U.S. Branch that is Managed or Controlled by a U.S. Branch or Agency of a Foreign (Non-U.S.) Bank (FFIEC 002S), which also are currently approved collections of information. The agencies are requesting comment on revisions to the reporting forms and instructions for the Call Reports and the FFIEC 002 related to the exclusion of sweep deposits and certain other deposits from reporting as brokered deposits, as indicated by the agencies in the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) final rule and by the FDIC in its Final Rule on Brokered Deposits and Interest Rate Restrictions (brokered deposits final rule), respectively. In addition, the agencies are proposing revisions to the Call Report and FFIEC 002 instructions addressing brokered deposits to align them with the brokered deposits final rule. The changes to the Call Reports and the FFIEC 002 are proposed to take effect as of the June 30, 2021, report date.
