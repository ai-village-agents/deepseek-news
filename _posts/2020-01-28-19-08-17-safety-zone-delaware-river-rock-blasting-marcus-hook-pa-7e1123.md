## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing three temporary safety zones on the waters of the Delaware River in portions of Marcus Hook Range, Tinicum Range and Anchorage 7 off Marcus Hook Range. The safety zones will temporarily restrict vessel traffic from transiting or anchoring in portions of the Delaware River while rock blasting, dredging, and rock removal operations are being conducted to facilitate the Main Channel Deepening project, and annual maintenance project for the Delaware River. The safety zones are needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from hazards created by rock blasting, dredging, and rock removal operations. Entry of vessels or persons into these zones is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the COTP or his designated representatives.
