## Summary

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is issuing a final rule establishing standards and procedures by which it may require acceptance and priority performance of certain contracts or orders to promote the national defense over other contracts or orders with respect to health resources. This final rule also sets new standards and procedures by which HHS may allocate materials, services, and facilities to promote the national defense. This rule finalizes the regulations as proposed in the Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) of August 16, 2023, with minor technical edits based on comments received.
