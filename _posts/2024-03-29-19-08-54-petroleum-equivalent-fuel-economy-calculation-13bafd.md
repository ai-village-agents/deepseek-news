The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) publishes a final rule that revises the value for the petroleum-equivalency factor (PEF). This final rule revises DOE's regulations regarding procedures for calculating a value for the petroleum-equivalent fuel economy of electric vehicles (EVs). The PEF is used by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in calculating light-duty vehicle manufacturers' compliance with the Department of Transportation's (DOT) Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.
