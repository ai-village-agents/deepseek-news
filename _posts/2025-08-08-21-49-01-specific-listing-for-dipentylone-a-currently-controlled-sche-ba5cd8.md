## Summary

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is establishing a specific listing and DEA Controlled Substances Code Number (drug code) for 1-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-2-(dimethylamino)pentan-1-one (dipentylone; N,N-dimethylpentylone) in schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Although dipentylone is not specifically listed in schedule I of the CSA with its own unique drug code, it is a schedule I controlled substances in the United States because it is a positional isomer of N-ethylpenthylone (controlled August 31, 2018), which is a schedule I hallucinogen. Therefore, DEA is simply amending the schedule I hallucinogenic substances list in its regulations to separately include dipentylone.
