## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 787-9 and 787-10 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of multiple supplier notices of escapement (NOEs) indicating that ram air turbine (RAT) forward fittings were possibly manufactured with an incorrect titanium alloy material. This AD requires a high frequency eddy current (HFEC) or handheld X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer inspection of the RAT forward fitting to determine the titanium alloy material and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
