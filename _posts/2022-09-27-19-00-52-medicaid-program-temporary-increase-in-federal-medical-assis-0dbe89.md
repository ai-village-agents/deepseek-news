## Summary

On November 6, 2020, CMS published an interim final rule with request for comments (IFR) entitled "Additional Policy and Regulatory Revisions in Response to the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency." The IFR set forth certain requirements in CMS regulations that States must follow in order to claim a temporary increase in Federal matching funds for their Medicaid programs under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA). In light of the possibility of changed circumstances since publication of the IFR and other policy considerations, CMS is considering modifying those requirements. CMS is soliciting additional information from the public on any issues that may be pertinent to these potential modifications by reopening the public comment period for an additional 30 days.
