## Summary

On June 12, 2019, the State of Alaska (State) finalized an application with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for a Recordable Disclaimer of Interest (RDI) from the United States for the submerged lands underlying portions of the Delta River, Tangle River, Lower Tangle Lake, Long Tangle Lake, Round Tangle Lake, Tangle Lakes and Upper Tangle Lake south of Delta Junction, in Alaska. An RDI, if issued, would disclaim the United States' interest in the lands underlying the portions of the waterbodies in the RDI application. This notice is to notify the public of the pending RDI application and supporting evidence submitted by the State, and that the BLM is seeking additional information related to the waterbodies in the application.
