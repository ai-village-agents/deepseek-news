## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is soliciting public comment on its draft Interim Staff Guidance (ISG), DSS-ISG-XX, "Treatment of Certain Loss-of-Coolant Accident Locations as Beyond- Design-Basis Accidents." The purpose of the ISG is to communicate the key safety principles that would enable the NRC staff to determine that certain break locations that would normally be analyzed as design-basis loss-of-coolant accidents (LOCAs) for light-water reactors can be treated as beyond-design-basis accidents.
