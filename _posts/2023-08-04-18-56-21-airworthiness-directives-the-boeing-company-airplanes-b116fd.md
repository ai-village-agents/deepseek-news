# Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-25-17, which applies to all The Boeing Company Model 737-600, - 700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER series airplanes. AD 2019-25-17 requires revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to prohibit selection of certain runways for airplanes equipped with certain software. Since the FAA issued AD 2019-25-17, Boeing has developed new software to address the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would retain the requirements of AD 2019-25-17. This proposed AD would also require installing the new software and performing a software configuration check, which would terminate the AFM revision. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
