## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Acquisition Solutions is giving notice that it proposes to modify a system of records pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. EPA's Acquisition System (EAS) is an automated contract writing and management system with configurable workflow used to initiate, award, modify, and track acquisition actions for the procurement of goods and services. The system of records notice for EPA Acquisition System (EAS) is being modified to reflect that the system is now hosted and data stored in Unison's Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud hosting environment, which is Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) authorized.
