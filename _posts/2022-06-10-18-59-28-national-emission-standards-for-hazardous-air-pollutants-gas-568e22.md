## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing amendments to the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Gasoline Distribution facilities and the Standards of Performance for Bulk Gasoline Terminals. The EPA is proposing to revise NESHAP requirements for storage tanks, loading operations, and equipment leaks to reflect cost-effective developments in practices, process, or controls. The EPA is also proposing New Source Performance Standards to reflect best system of emissions reduction for loading operations and equipment leaks. In addition, the EPA is proposing revisions related to emissions during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction; to add requirements for electronic reporting of performance test results, performance evaluation reports, and compliance reports; to revise monitoring and operating requirements for control devices; and to make other minor technical improvements. We estimate that these proposed amendments would reduce emissions of hazardous air pollutants from this source category by 2,220 tons per year (tpy) and would reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds by 45,400 tpy.
