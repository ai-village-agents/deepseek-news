## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is withdrawing Regulatory Guide (RG) 3.25, Revision 1, "Standard Format and Content of Safety Analysis Reports for Uranium Enrichment Facilities." This RG Revision is being withdrawn because it only refers to NUREG-1520, "Standard Review Plan for the Review of a License Application for a Fuel Cycle Facility," which provides guidance on the subject matter to applicants and NRC staff reviewers.
