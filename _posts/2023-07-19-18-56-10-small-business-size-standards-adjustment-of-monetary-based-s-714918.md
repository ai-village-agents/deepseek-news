## Summary

This rule finalizes, without change, the U.S. Small Business Administration's (SBA or Agency) November 17, 2022, interim provisions that adjusted monetary-based industry size standards (i.e., receipts- and assets-based) for inflation. Specifically, this rule finalizes three interim final actions adopted in the November 17, 2022 rule. First, this rule finalizes an additional 13.65 percent inflation increase to the industry-based monetary small business size standards to account for the inflation that occurred since the last adjustment to size standards for inflation in 2019. Second, this rule finalizes inflation adjustments to three program-specific monetary size standards: the size standards for sales or leases of government property, the size standards for stockpile purchases, and the alternative size standard based on tangible net worth and net income for the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program. Third, this rule finalizes inflation adjustments to the economic disadvantage thresholds applicable to the 8(a) Business Development and Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Business programs, and the dollar limit for combined total 8(a) contracts.
