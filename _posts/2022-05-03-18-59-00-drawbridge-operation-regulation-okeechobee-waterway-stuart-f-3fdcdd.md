## Summary

The Coast Guard is seeking information and comments on a proposed change to the operating regulations for the Florida East Coast (FEC) Railroad Bridge, mile 7.4, and the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge, mile 7.5, across the Okeechobee Waterway (OWW), at Stuart, Florida. In anticipation of passenger rail service across the FEC Railroad Bridge, the Coast Guard intends to propose a change that will allow the drawbridge to operate on a more predictable schedule. The Coast Guard intends to propose a similar operating schedule for the adjacent SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
