## Summary

The Touhy regulations of the Defense Nuclear Facilities Board (DNFSB or the Board) set forth procedures for responding to requests for information, documents, or testimony for use in legal proceedings. This direct final rule revises the regulations by clarifying that Touhy regulations only apply when the United States or the Board is not a party to the underlying legal proceedings.
