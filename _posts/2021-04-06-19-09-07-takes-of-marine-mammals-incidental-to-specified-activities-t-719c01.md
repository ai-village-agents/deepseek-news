## Summary

NMFS has received a request from Chevron Products Company (Chevron) for an incidental harassment authorization (IHA), that would cover a subset of the take authorized in IHAs previously issued to Chevron, to incidentally take marine mammals, by Level B harassment only, during construction activities associated with the Chevron Richmond Refinery Long Wharf Maintenance and Efficiency Project (LWMEP) in San Francisco Bay, California. However, some changes have occurred during this year's evaluation of the project. Hydroacoustic monitoring data has led to changes in source levels and other noise generating criteria that affect Level A and Level B harassment and shutdown zones. The local abundance for one population has increased. Pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), NMFS is requesting comments on its proposal to issue an IHA to incidentally take marine mammals during the specified activities. NMFS is also requesting comments on a possible 1 year renewal IHA that could be issued under certain circumstances and if all requirements are met, as described in Request for Public Comments at the end of this notice. NMFS will consider public comments prior to making any final decision on the issuance of the requested MMPA authorizations and agency responses will be summarized in the final notice of our decision.
