## Summary

Pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) signed an Order, dated March 8, 2023, granting a petition to object to a state operating permit issued by the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE). The Order responds to an October 28, 2022 petition, relating to the Cove Point LNG Terminal (Cove Point), a liquefied natural gas storage and terminal facility located in Calvert County, Maryland. The petition was submitted by the Environmental Integrity Project and the Chesapeake Climate Action Network (the Petitioners). This Order constitutes final action on that petition requesting that the Administrator object to the issuance of the proposed CAA title V permit.
