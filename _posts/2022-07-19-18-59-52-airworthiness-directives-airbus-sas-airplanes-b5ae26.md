# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus SAS Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A300 B2K-3C, B2-203, B4-2C, and B4-203 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of cracking of the flight compartment aft window frame and adjacent fuselage skin. This proposed AD would require a one-time check for previously accomplished repairs of the window pane and adjacent fuselage panel, and applicable corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
