## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce 90- day findings on 10 petitions to add species to the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Based on our review, we find that the petitions to list Betta hendra, Betta rutilans, Hickory Nut Gorge green salamander (Aneides caryaensis), pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis), Railroad Valley toad (Anaxyrus nevadensis), Southern Plains bumble bee (Bombus fraternus), Southwest spring firefly (Bicellonycha wickershamorum), white-margined penstemon (Penstemon albomarginatus), and yellow-spotted woodland salamander (Plethodon pauleyi) present substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned actions may be warranted. Therefore, with the publication of this document, we announce that we are initiating status reviews of these species to determine whether the petitioned actions are warranted. To ensure that the status reviews are comprehensive, we request scientific and commercial data and other information regarding the species and factors that may affect their status. Based on the status reviews, we will issue 12-month petition findings, which will address whether or not the petitioned actions are warranted in accordance with the Act. We further find that the petition to list the eastern hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis) does not present substantial information indicating the petitioned action may be warranted. Therefore, we are not initiating a status review of the eastern hellbender.
