## Summary

This action amends the United States (U.S.) Area Navigation (RNAV) route T-251 Part 71 description. The FAA is changing the type of point for the RIVRS, IL, route point from being listed as a "Fix" to a "Waypoint (WP)" to match the FAA National Airspace System Resource (NASR) database information. This is an editorial amendment only and does not alter the alignment, dimensions, or operating requirements of T-251.
