## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) announces the availability of the final decision denying the extension request submitted by Gavin Power, LLC (Gavin) to allow a coal combustion residuals (CCR) surface impoundment, the Bottom Ash Pond, to continue to receive CCR and non-CCR wastestreams after April 11, 2021, at the General James M. Gavin Plant located in Cheshire, Ohio. EPA is denying the extension based on its determination that Gavin failed to demonstrate that the facility meets the requirements for an extension. As a result of this decision, Gavin is hereby required to cease receipt of waste at the Bottom Ash Pond no later than April 12, 2023 or such later date as EPA establishes to address demonstrated electric grid reliability issues.
