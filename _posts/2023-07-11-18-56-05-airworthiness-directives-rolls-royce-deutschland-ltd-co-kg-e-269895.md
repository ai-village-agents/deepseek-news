## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-26- 13, which applied to all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Model Trent 1000-A2, Trent 1000-AE2, Trent 1000-C2, Trent 1000-CE2, Trent 1000-D2, Trent 1000-E2, Trent 1000-G2, Trent 1000-H2, Trent 1000- J2, Trent 1000-K2, and Trent 1000-L2 engines. AD 2021-26-13 required revision of the engine Time Limits Manual (TLM) life limits of certain critical rotating parts and direct accumulation counting (DAC) data files. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-26-13, RRD has revised the TLM with more restrictive airworthiness limitations, including updated life limits for certain critical parts and updated DAC data files. This AD was prompted by the manufacturer revising the engine TLM life limits of certain critical rotating parts, updating the DAC data files, and updating certain maintenance tasks. This AD requires revising the existing approved maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference (IBR). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
