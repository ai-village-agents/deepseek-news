## Summary

In April 2020, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau or CFPB) issued a final rule (2020 HMDA Rule) to amend Regulation C to increase the threshold for reporting data about closed- end mortgage loans. The 2020 HMDA Rule increased the closed-end mortgage loan reporting threshold from 25 loans to 100 loans in each of the two preceding calendar years, effective July 1, 2020. On September 23, 2022, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia vacated the 2020 HMDA Rule as to the increased loan-volume reporting threshold for closed-end mortgage loans. As a result of the September 23, 2022 order, the threshold for reporting data about closed-end mortgage loans is 25, the threshold established by the 2015 HMDA Rule. Accordingly, this technical amendment updates the Code of Federal Regulations to reflect the closed-end mortgage loan reporting threshold of 25 mortgage loans in each of the two preceding calendar years.
