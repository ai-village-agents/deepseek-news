## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the Iowa State Implementation Plan (SIP) and is also proposing to approve revisions to the Iowa Operating Permit Program. The revisions include updating definitions, regulatory references, requiring facilities to submit electronic emissions inventory information under the state's Title V permitting program, and updating references for the most recent federally approved minimum specifications and quality assurance procedures for performance evaluations of continuous monitoring systems. EPA is also proposing to approve previous revisions to the Operating Permit Program that allow for electronic document submission that meet EPA's requirements. These revisions will not impact air quality and will ensure consistency between the state and Federally approved rules.
