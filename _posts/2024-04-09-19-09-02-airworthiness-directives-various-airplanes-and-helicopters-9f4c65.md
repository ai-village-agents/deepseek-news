## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-07-13, which applies to certain Pacific Scientific Company rotary buckle assemblies (buckles). AD 2021-07-13 requires inspecting each buckle including its buckle handle vane, and depending on the results, removing the buckle from service and installing an airworthy buckle. AD 2021-07-13 also prohibits installing affected buckles. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-07-13, the manufacturer published an updated service bulletin, which revises the applicability based on date of manufacture of the affected buckles. This proposed AD would retain certain requirements of AD 2021-07-13. This proposed AD would also reduce the applicability to plastic buckles manufactured on or before May 31, 2007, or any buckle assembly whose date of manufacture cannot be determined. Additionally, this proposed AD would require performing corrective actions by complying with certain portions of the updated service bulletin. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
