## Summary

On May 17, 2019, the United States announced joint understandings with Canada and Mexico, respectively, to eliminate tariffs imposed under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, on imports of steel and aluminum products from Canada and Mexico and to establish a process for monitoring such imports. Consistent with the joint understandings, and to enhance U.S. Government monitoring and analysis of steel imports more generally, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) publishes this proposed rule to enhance its existing Steel Import Monitoring and Analysis (SIMA) system to allow for the effective and timely monitoring of import surges of specific steel products which will aid in the prevention of transshipment of steel products. Specifically, Commerce proposes to modify its regulations to require import license applicants to identify the country where the steel used in the manufacture of the imported steel product was melted and poured, and to release this data on an aggregate basis, as appropriate; to harmonize the scope of SIMA's licensing requirement with the scope of steel products subject to Section 232 tariffs; to extend the SIMA system indefinitely by eliminating the regulatory provision concerning the duration of the SIMA system; and to expand eligibility for use of the low-value license for certain steel entries. Commerce will address the monitoring of aluminum imports in a separate rulemaking.
