## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2024-06-02 for all GE Aviation Czech s.r.o. (GEAC) Model M601D-11, M601E-11, M601E-11A, M601E-11AS, M601E-11S, and M601F engines. AD 2024-06-02 required a one-time detailed visual inspection (DVI) of the compressor case pad welds for any crack, and replacement of the compressor case if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2024-06-02, the manufacturer determined that the compliance time for the DVI can be extended, and repetitive inspections of the centrifugal compressor case must be accomplished. This AD requires performing repetitive DVIs of the compressor case pad welds for any crack, replacing the compressor case if necessary, and sending certain inspection results to the manufacturer. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
