## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Scheibe-Aircraft-GmbH Model SF 25 C gliders. This AD was prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) issued by the aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as severe corrosion on the inner surface of the control stick tube. This AD requires inspecting the left-hand (LH) and right-hand (RH) control sticks for corrosion and, if corrosion is found, replacing the affected control stick. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
