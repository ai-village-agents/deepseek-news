## Summary

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing to revise the procedures for determining whether an individual's failure to register with the Selective Service System (SSS) was knowing and willful. These changes are intended to ensure that individuals in these circumstances have an opportunity to fully explain their failure to register and that the determination is based on a more complete record. In addition, the rule proposes to enable Federal agencies to make initial determinations as to whether an individual's failure to register with the SSS was knowing and willful.
