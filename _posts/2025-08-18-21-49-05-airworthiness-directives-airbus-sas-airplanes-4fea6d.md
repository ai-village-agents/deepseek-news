## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A319-112 and -132 airplanes, and Model A320- 214, -232, -233, -251N, and -271N airplanes. This AD was prompted by rivet holes being left unplugged after bracket relocation or removal accomplished during certain modifications, potentially resulting in fatigue damage starting from those rivet holes. This AD requires a one- time special detailed inspection (SDI) of the rivet holes and applicable corrective actions; and allows the installation of certain modifications, provided rivets are installed after the modification. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
