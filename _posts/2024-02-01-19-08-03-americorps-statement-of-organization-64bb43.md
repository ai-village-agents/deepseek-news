## Summary

The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), which operates as AmeriCorps, is finalizing a rule to provide general information to the public about its structure and purpose, as required by the Administrative Procedure Act. While AmeriCorps already provides information about its organizational structure on its public-facing website (americorps.gov), this rule would comply with the statutory requirement that agencies publish in the Federal Register their descriptions of organization. This rule will also increase transparency regarding AmeriCorps' operations by mapping out its existing program regulations, thereby providing an overview of the Agency's programs.
