## Summary

As part of its implementation of the Executive Order, "Unleashing American Energy" (Jan. 20, 2025), the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is reviewing existing agency actions to ensure, among other things, that all regulatory requirements related to energy are grounded in clearly applicable law and that the American people's freedom to choose from a variety of goods and appliances is not restricted. As a result of this review, DOE is proposing to withdraw its prior determination that miscellaneous gas products ("MGPs"), which are comprised of decorative hearths and outdoor heaters, qualify as covered products under Part A of Title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended ("EPCA"). After further consideration of the relevant statutory authority and available information, DOE is proposing to withdraw its determination that MGPs are covered products under EPCA for which DOE is authorized to establish test procedures and energy conservation standards.
