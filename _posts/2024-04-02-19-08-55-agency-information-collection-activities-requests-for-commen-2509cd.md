## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves operators and owners of small unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) issued an airworthiness certificate and mandates that these entities must retain records of all maintenance performed on their aircraft and records documenting the status of life- limited parts, compliance with airworthiness directives, and inspection status of the aircraft. These records are used to validate that aircraft are maintained in a manner that ensures the reliability associated with having an airworthiness certificate and that the operations-over-people privileges afforded to category 4 operations continue to be appropriate. The owner or operator may keep these records electronically or by paper.
