## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action on the residual risk and technology reviews (RTRs) conducted for the Surface Coating of Metal Cans and Surface Coating of Metal Coil source categories regulated under national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP). The EPA is also taking final action on amendments for the two source categories to address emissions during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM); electronic reporting of performance test results and compliance reports; the addition of EPA Method 18 and updates to several measurement methods; and the addition of requirements for periodic performance testing. Additionally, several miscellaneous technical amendments are being made to improve the clarity of the rule requirements. We are making no revisions to the numerical emission limits for the two source categories based on the residual risk and technology reviews.
