## Summary

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is withdrawing its proposed rule to prohibit banks and other financial institutions from charging certain nonsufficient funds (NSF) fees, such as those for declined debit card purchases, Automated Teller Machine (ATM) withdrawals, and some person-to-person payments. The CFPB will determine whether a more comprehensive approach to also prohibit NSF fees charged for additional types of transactions will better protect consumers from potentially unlawful fees.
