## Summary

The Census Bureau (Bureau) is removing its regulations related to the release of decennial census population information. Such regulations are obsolete and have not applied to the determination of methodology for calculating the tabulations of total population reported to states and localities under 13 U.S.C. 141(c) since the decennial census in 2000. This action is necessary to remove obsolete regulatory language, keep the Bureau's regulations current, and ensure that the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) is able to fulfill his statutory obligations without being hindered by an unnecessary administrative process.
