“Red Earth and Scarlet Gold” recounts the memorial service and burial of Parker Emhoolah on Feb. 10, tracing how tribal nations, veterans, Soldiers and community members came together to honor a retired U.S. Marine and Kiowa elder whose life bridged military service, cultural tradition and decades of community leadership.


The story opens at Chief’s Knoll in the Fort Sill Post Cemetery, where Kiowa and Comanche songs, red cloaks and the use of red earth marked a farewell rooted in land and family. Emhoolah’s widow, Tina Parker Emhoolah, delivers his final message in Kiowa and English, telling mourners he “wasn’t afraid to die.”


From memorial events in Lawton to the procession onto Fort Sill, the feature weaves in reflections from Lt. Col. Corrie Brice, Edmond Nevaquaya, Cheever Toppah and acting garrison commander Julia Sibilla, with additional faith-based context from Chaplain Lisa Northway, highlighting Emhoolah’s wartime service, his role as a song keeper, and the way he quietly drew people together across cultures and generations.


The article also explains why Chief’s Knoll matters: it is sacred, historic ground where prominent Native leaders are buried and where tribal history and the Army’s presence intersect, including the burial site of Cynthia Ann Parker. Emhoolah’s burial there on Feb. 10 is framed as both a personal tribute and a public reaffirmation of Fort Sill’s enduring relationship with tribal partners and the shared responsibility to honor service, preserve heritage and sustain trust.
