## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), make available an application for an incidental take permit (ITP) supported by a low-effect habitat conservation plan (LEHCP) for the Four Corners Water Development Project, Pueblo of Santa Clara, Rio Arriba County, New Mexico. The Pueblo of Santa Clara has applied to the Service for an ITP under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. The requested ITP, which would be in effect for a period of 20 years, if granted, would authorize incidental take of the federally endangered Rio Grande silvery minnow. In accordance with National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requirements, we have determined that the proposed action qualifies for a categorical exclusion as low effect. We are accepting comments on the permit application, proposed LEHCP, and draft NEPA screening form.
