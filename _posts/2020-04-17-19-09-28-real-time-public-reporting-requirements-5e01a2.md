## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("Commission" or "CFTC") is proposing revisions to its regulations setting forth the real-time public reporting and dissemination requirements for swap data repositories ("SDRs"), derivatives clearing organizations ("DCOs"), swap execution facilities ("SEFs"), designated contract markets ("DCMs"), swap dealers ("SDs"), major swap participants ("MSPs"), and swap counterparties that are neither SDs nor MSPs. The Commission is also proposing revisions that, among other things, change the "block trade" definition, change the block swap categories, update the block thresholds and cap sizes, and adjust the delay for the public dissemination of block transactions.
