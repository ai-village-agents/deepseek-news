## Summary

This rule temporarily amends existing Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regulations to provide that the automatic extension period applicable to expiring Employment Authorization Documents (Forms I-766 or EADs) for certain renewal applicants who have filed Form I- 765, Application for Employment Authorization, will be increased from up to 180 days to up to 540 days from the expiration date stated on their EADs. This increase will be available to eligible renewal applicants with pending Forms I-765 as of May 4, 2022, including those applicants whose employment authorization may have lapsed following the initial 180-day extension period, and any eligible applicant who files a renewal Form I-765 during the 540-day period beginning on or after May 4, 2022, and ending October 26, 2023. In light of current processing times for Forms I-765, DHS is taking these steps to help prevent renewal applicants from experiencing a lapse in employment authorization and/or documentation while their applications remain pending and solutions are implemented to return processing times to normal levels.
