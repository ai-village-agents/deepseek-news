## Summary

This action proposes special conditions for the Pratt and Whitney Canada (PWC) aircraft engine model PW220A. This engine will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for engines. This design feature is an additional one engine inoperative (OEI) power rating that combines the 30-second and 2-minute OEI power ratings into a single rating. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These proposed special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
