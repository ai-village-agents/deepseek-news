## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to determine that the Sullivan County, Tennessee sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) nonattainment area failed to attain the 2010 1-hour SO<INF>2</INF> primary National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS or standard) by the applicable attainment date of October 4, 2018, based upon a weight of evidence analysis of available quality-assured and certified SO<INF>2</INF> ambient air monitoring data and SO<INF>2</INF> emissions data from January 2015 through December 2017. If EPA finalizes this determination as proposed, the State of Tennessee will be required to submit revisions to the Tennessee State Implementation Plan (SIP) that, among other elements, provide for expeditious attainment of the 2010 SO<INF>2</INF> standard.
