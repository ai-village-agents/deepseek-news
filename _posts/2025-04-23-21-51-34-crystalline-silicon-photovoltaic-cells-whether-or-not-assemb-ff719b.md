## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily intends to revoke, in part, of the antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells, whether or not assembled into modules (solar cells), from the People's Republic of China (China) with respect to certain small, low- wattage, off-grid (CSPV) cells as described below. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.
