## Summary

This action changes the effective date of a final rule published in the Federal Register on January 14, 2022, amending VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-170, V-175, and V-250, and establishing area navigation (RNAV) route T-400, due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Worthington, MN, VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) navigational aid. The FAA is delaying the effective date to facilitate continued use of the current Air Traffic Procedures, while allowing sufficient time for redesign of the proposed procedures, in order to meet to required current procedure criteria.
