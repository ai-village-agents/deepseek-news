## Summary

The Surface Transportation Project Delivery Program, commonly known as the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Assignment Program, allows a State to assume FHWA's environmental responsibilities for review, consultation, and compliance for Federal highway projects. When a State assumes these Federal responsibilities, the State becomes solely responsible and liable for the responsibilities it has assumed, in lieu of FHWA. This program mandates annual audits during each of the first 4 years to ensure the State's compliance with program requirements. This is the fourth and final audit of the Florida Department of Transportation's (FDOT) performance of its responsibilities under the NEPA Assignment Program. This notice finalizes the findings of the fourth and final audit report for FDOT.
