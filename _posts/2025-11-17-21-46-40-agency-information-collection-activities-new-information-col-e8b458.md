## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FMCSA announces its plan to submit the Information Collection Request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review and approval and invites public comment. FMCSA needs additional data to answer important questions related to driver schedules and how these factors impact overall driver performance and fatigue. This research requires data to be collected for hours of service (HOS) duty logs, accident and incident data, and inspection violations records. The information collected will be used to examine the relative risk of crashes and inspection violations based on various factors related to the driver's work schedule and demographics.
