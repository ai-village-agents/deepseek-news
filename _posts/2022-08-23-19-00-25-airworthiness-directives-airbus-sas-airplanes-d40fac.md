## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-14-08, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A319-151N, A319-153N, A319-171N, A320-251N, A320-252N, A320-273N, A321-251N, A321-251NX, A321-252N, A321-252NX, A321-253N, A321-253NX, A321-271N, A321-271NX, A321-272N, and A321-272NX airplanes. AD 2021-14-08 requires revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to include a procedure to reinforce the airspeed check during the take-off phase and provide instructions to abort take-off in certain cases. This AD was prompted by the development of a software update to the elevator aileron computer (ELAC) to address the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2021-14-08 and would require replacing each affected ELAC and removing the AFM revision required by AD 2021-14-08, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
