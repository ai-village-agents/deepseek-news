## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the New York State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone concerning the control of volatile organic compounds. The proposed SIP revision consists of amendments to regulations in New York's Codes, Rules and Regulations (NYCRR) applicable to gasoline dispensing sites and transport vehicles. The intended effect of today's action is to approve control strategies, required by the Clean Air Act, which will result in emission reductions that will help attain and maintain national ambient air quality standards for ozone and will reduce volatile organic compounds throughout the State.
