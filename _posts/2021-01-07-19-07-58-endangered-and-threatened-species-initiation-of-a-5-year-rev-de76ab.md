## Summary

NMFS announces a 5-year review of staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis), elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata), pillar coral (Dendrogyra cylindrus), rough cactus coral (Mycetophyllia ferox), lobed star coral (Orbicella annularis), mountainous star coral (Orbicella faveolata), and boulder star coral (Orbicella franksi) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA). A 5-year review is based on the best scientific and commercial data available at the time of the review; therefore, we are requesting submission of any such information on staghorn coral, elkhorn coral, pillar coral, rough cactus coral, lobed star coral, mountainous star coral, and boulder star coral that has become available since their original listings as threatened species or the most recent status review for staghorn and elkhorn coral in 2014.
