## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce a 6-month extension of the final determination on whether to remove the ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis), a bird species historically found in the American southeast, from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife (List). We are also reopening the comment period on the proposed rule to remove this species from the List for an additional 30 days. Comments previously submitted need not be resubmitted and will be fully considered in preparation of the final determination. We are taking this action to extend the final determination based on substantial disagreement regarding the status of the ivory-billed woodpecker.
