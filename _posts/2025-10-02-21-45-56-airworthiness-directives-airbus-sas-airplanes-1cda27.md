## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A330-200, A330-200 Freighter, A330-300, A340-200, A340-300, A340-500, and A340-600 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by the determination that, during flight with landing gear down, the brake system accumulators and shut-off valve (SOV) protecting the brake accumulators might be exposed to a temperature lower than the one for which the accumulator and SOV are qualified. This AD is also prompted by the determination that, if an airplane is dispatched under existing conditions associated with the "L/G Retraction Fault" alert, operations for Constant Speed Motor/Generator (CSM/G) will be prevented. This AD requires revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to incorporate new procedures for flight with landing gear down and the existing minimum equipment list (MEL) to prevent dispatch with an "L/G Retraction Fault" alert. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
