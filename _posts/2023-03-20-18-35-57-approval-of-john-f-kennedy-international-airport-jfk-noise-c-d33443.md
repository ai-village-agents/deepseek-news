## Summary

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its findings for the noise compatibility program submitted by JFK. See SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION for details. On May 19, 2017, the FAA determined that the noise exposure maps submitted by JFK were in compliance with applicable requirements. On September 16, 2022, the FAA determined that the noise compatibility program submitted by JFK would be initiating final review for approval or disapproval. On March 14, 2023, the FAA approved the JFK noise compatibility program. The noise compatibility program contained 22 recommended measures, including seven noise abatement measures, three land use measures, and 12 program management measures. Of the measures proposed, 15 were approved, four were approved as voluntary, two were disapproved, and one was determined to have no FAA action as continuations of existing mandatory practices at JFK. Three of the seven noise abatement measures proposed at JFK are related to new or revised flight procedures.
