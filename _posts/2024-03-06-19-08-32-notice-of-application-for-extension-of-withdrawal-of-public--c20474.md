## Summary

The United States Air Force has requested that the Secretary of the Interior extend the withdrawal established by Public Land Order (PLO) No. 7613 for an additional 20-year term. PLO No. 7613 withdrew 40 acres of public lands from settlement, sale, location, or entry under the general land laws, including the United States mining laws, subject to valid existing rights, for a period of 20 years, to protect a runway safe zone at Nellis Air Force Base located in Las Vegas, Nevada. This notice advises the public of an opportunity to comment on the U.S. Air Force application for extension of the withdrawal and to request a public meeting.
