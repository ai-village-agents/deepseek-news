## Summary

This action amends the Class D and Class E airspace, establishes Class E airspace, and revokes Class E airspace at Wichita, KS. The name of Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport, Wichita, KS; the geographic coordinates of Augusta Municipal Airport, Augusta, KS; and the name and geographic coordinates of the McConnell AFB, Wichita, KS, and the Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower NTL: RWY 01R-LOC are also being updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database. These actions accommodate a U.S. Air Force request to change the McConnell AFB Class D airspace from full-time to part-time and to establish part-time Class E surface airspace, and the associated airspace reviews conducted to accommodate this request. It also brings the airspace into compliance with FAA orders and supports instrument flight rule (IFR) procedures and operations.
