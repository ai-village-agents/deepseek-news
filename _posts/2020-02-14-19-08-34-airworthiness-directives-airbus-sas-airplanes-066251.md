## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2014-24- 07, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; A320-211, -212, -214, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321- 111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2014- 24-07 required repetitive rototest inspections for cracking; corrective actions if necessary; and modification of the torsion box, which terminates the repetitive inspections. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2014-24-07, with certain revised compliance times, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD was prompted by a report of a crack found in the side box beam flange of the fuselage at the frame (FR) 43 level during a fatigue test campaign. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
