## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC, the Commission) is issuing for public comment draft environmental impact statement (EIS) NUREG-1437, Supplement 5a, Second Renewal, "Site-Specific Environmental Impact Statement for License Renewal of Nuclear Plants Regarding Subsequent License Renewal for Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Unit Nos. 3 and 4, Draft Report for Comment." Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Unit Nos. 3 and 4 (Turkey Point) is located in Homestead, Florida, approximately 25 miles south-southwest of Miami. Possible alternatives to the proposed action of subsequent license renewal for Turkey Point include the no-action alternative and reasonable replacement power alternatives. A new notice of opportunity to request a hearing and petition for leave to intervene--limited to contentions based on new information in the draft EIS--is also being issued.
