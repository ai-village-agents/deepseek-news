## Summary

In this document, the Commission seeks to obtain detailed comment to enable it to make further progress toward ensuring that the rates, charges, and practices for and in connection with interstate and international inmate calling services meet applicable statutory standard. In this document FCC 22-76, the Commission seeks comment on whether to adopt a form of enterprise registration for IP CTS, whether to increase inmate services providers' TRS-related access obligations to include providing access to advanced forms of TRS in jurisdictions with an average daily population of less than 50 incarcerated persons, and whether inmate calling services providers should disclose their charges in an accessible format for disabled incarcerated people. The Commission also seeks comment on whether it should refine its rules concerning the treatment of unused funds in accounts that consumers use to pay for interstate and international inmate calling services and related ancillary services charges, on how it might improve its consumer disclosure rules, and on how the Commission should use the responses to the Third Mandatory Data Collection to establish reasonable, permanent caps on rates and ancillary service charges for interstate and international calling services for incarcerated people. The Commission seeks further comment on whether to allow inmate calling services providers to offer pilot programs that offer consumers the ability to purchase inmate calling services under alternative pricing structures. Last, the Commission also seeks comment on whether it should expand its definitions of "Jail" and "Prison" and on how its proposals may promote or inhibit advances in diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility.
