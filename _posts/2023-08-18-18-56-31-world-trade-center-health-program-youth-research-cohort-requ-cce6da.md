## Summary

CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is extending the public comment period for a request for information (RFI) that published April 26, 2023, regarding a World Trade Center (WTC) Health Program research cohort for future studies on health, social, and educational impacts among persons exposed to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks who were aged 21 years or younger at the time of their exposures. An organization interested in responding to the RFI asked CDC to extend the comment period to allow more time to submit comments. With this notice, the comment period is extended an additional 60 days, to allow interested parties additional time to respond.
