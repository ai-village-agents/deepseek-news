## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is publishing a final rule to establish definitions for "direct expansion-dedicated outdoor air systems" ("DX-DOASes") and "unitary dedicated outdoor air systems" ("unitary DOASes"). Unitary DOASes are a category of small, large, and very large commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended. In addition, DOE is establishing a test procedure to measure the energy efficiency of DX-DOASes, which aligns with the most recent version of the relevant industry consensus test standards for DX-DOASes, with certain minor modifications. Lastly, DOE is adopting supporting definitions, energy efficiency metrics for dehumidification and heating modes, and provisions governing public representations as part of this rulemaking.
