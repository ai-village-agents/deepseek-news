## Summary

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) designated the Wisconsin Shipwreck Coast National Marine Sanctuary (WSCNMS) on June 23, 2021, and the final rule became effective on August 16, 2021. However, as discussed in the final rule, the provision that prohibits grappling into or anchoring on shipwreck sites (grappling and anchoring provision) was to go into effect on October 1, 2023. This action delays the effectiveness of the grappling and anchoring provision of the final rule until October 1, 2024.
