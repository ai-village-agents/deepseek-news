## Summary

The NCUA Board (Board) is amending its methodology for computing the annual operating fees it charges to federal credit unions (FCUs). First, for purposes of calculating the annual operating fee, the Board will increase the current asset exemption threshold from $1 million to $2 million. Second, the Board will adjust the asset exemption threshold annually in future years by the computed rate of aggregate asset growth at FCUs. Third, in response to comments from the public, as part of future reviews of the Operating Fee Schedule methodology the Board plans to analyze options to adjust the distribution of operating fee costs.
