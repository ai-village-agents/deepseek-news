## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Williams International Co., L.L.C. (Williams) FJ44-2A, FJ44-2C, FJ44-3A, and FJ44-3A-24 model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by a report of cracks in the high-pressure turbine (HPT) disk posts and failure of an HPT disk post, resulting in the contained fracture of an HPT disk post and blade. This AD requires removing the HPT disk, part number (P/N) 67093, from service before reaching defined cycle limits and replacing it with a part eligible for installation. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
