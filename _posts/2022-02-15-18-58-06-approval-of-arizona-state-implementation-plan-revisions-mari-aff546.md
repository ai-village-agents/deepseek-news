## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve revisions to the Maricopa County Air Quality Department's (MCAQD or Department) portion of the state implementation plan (SIP) for the State of Arizona. We are finalizing full approval of six MCAQD rules for the Department's New Source Review (NSR) preconstruction permitting program for new and modified stationary sources of air pollution under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act). The revisions update the MCAQD's NSR permitting program for new and modified sources of air pollution.
