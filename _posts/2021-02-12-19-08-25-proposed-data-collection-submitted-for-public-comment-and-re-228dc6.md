## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a request for emergency clearance of the information collection titled Requirement for Negative Pre-Departure Covid-19 Test Result or Documentation of Recovery from Covid-19 for all Airline or other Aircraft Passengers arriving into the United States from any foreign country. This collection accompanies a CDC Order of the same name and is designed to prohibit the introduction into the United States of any airline passenger departing from the any foreign country unless the passenger: (1) Has a negative pre-departure test result for COVID-19 (Qualifying Test), or (2) has written or electronic documentation of recovery from COVID-19 in the form of a positive viral test result and a letter from a licensed health care provider or public health official stating that the passenger has been cleared for travel.
