## Summary

On November 14, 2023, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) published in the Federal Register a proposal that would update all three components of Regulation II's interchange fee cap based on the latest data reported to the Board by large debit card issuers, update the interchange fee cap every other year going forward by directly linking the interchange fee cap to data from the Board's biennial survey of large debit card issuers, and implement a set of technical revisions to the regulation. The proposal provided for a comment period ending on February 12, 2024. The Board is extending the comment period for 90 days, until May 12, 2024. Further, additional data concerning the proposed new methodology for determining the base component of the interchange fee cap are being made available on the Board's website.
