## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to provisionally renew the exemption currently held by CRST The Transportation Solution (CRST) (formerly known as CRST Expedited, Inc.) from the requirement that a commercial driver's license (CDL) holder with the proper CDL class and endorsements be seated in the front seat of the commercial motor vehicle (CMV) at all times while the commercial learner's permit (CLP) holder is engaged in behind-the-wheel training on public roads or highways. Under the terms and conditions of the exemption, a CLP holder who has passed the skills test but not yet received the CDL document may drive a CRST CMV accompanied by a CDL holder who is not necessarily in the passenger seat, provided the CLP driver possesses documentation of passing from the State that administered the skills test. The exemption renewal is for five years.
