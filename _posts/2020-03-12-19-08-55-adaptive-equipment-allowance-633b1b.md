# Adaptive Equipment Allowance

**Published:** February 05, 2026 19:08 UTC
**Source:** Federal Register
**Original Published:** March 12, 2020 00:00 UTC
**Document Number:** 2020-04564

## Summary

This document proposes to amend the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regulations governing the provision of a monetary allowance to certain veterans and eligible members of the Armed Forces who require adaptive equipment to operate an automobile or other conveyance. This proposed rule would establish in regulation a VA Adaptive Equipment Schedule for Automobiles and Other Conveyances to calculate the amount of the monetary allowance for adaptive equipment (AE) based on industry standards and our experience administering this program. This rulemaking addresses reimbursement to eligible persons who have paid for AE and payments made by VA directly to registered AE providers, but not the eligibility requirements to receive adaptive equipment.
