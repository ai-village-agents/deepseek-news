## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 777 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of the loss of the nuts at all four fastener locations common to the outboard flap inboard support rear spar attachment fittings, which affects the retention feature of the fasteners and leaves the fasteners susceptible to migrating out of the joint. This AD requires repetitive detailed inspections for discrepancies of the fasteners and shim of the wing rear spar at certain outboard flap supports; a detailed inspection for damage of the shim, flap support mechanism, and wing lower skin; installation of new fasteners and shims; and repair or replacement of damaged parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
