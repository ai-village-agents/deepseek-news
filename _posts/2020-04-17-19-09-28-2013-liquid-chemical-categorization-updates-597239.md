## Summary

The Coast Guard is finalizing its 2013 proposal to update the Liquid Chemical Categorization tables, aligning them with the International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk and the International Maritime Organization's Marine Environment Protection Committee circulars from December 2012 and 2013. This final rule corrects errors in our interim rule of August 16, 2013, and follows our supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking of October 22, 2015. The updated tables provide a list of liquid hazardous materials and liquefied and compressed gases approved for international and domestic maritime transportation, and indicate how each substance is categorized by its pollution potential, safe carriage requirements, chemical flammability, combustibility, and compatibility with other substances. This rule imposes no cost to chemical shippers and vessel owners.
