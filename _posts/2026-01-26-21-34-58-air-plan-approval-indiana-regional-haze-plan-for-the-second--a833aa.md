## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving the Regional Haze State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision for Indiana submitted by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM or Indiana) on December 29, 2021, as satisfying applicable requirements under the Clean Air Act (CAA) and EPA's Regional Haze Rule (RHR) for the program's second implementation period. Indiana's SIP submission addresses the requirement that States must periodically revise their long-term strategies for making reasonable progress towards the national goal of preventing any future, and remedying any existing, anthropogenic impairment of visibility, including regional haze, in mandatory Class I Federal areas. Indiana's SIP submission also addresses other applicable requirements for the second implementation period of the regional haze program. EPA is taking this action pursuant to sections 110 and 169A of the CAA.
