## Summary

The Maritime Administration (MARAD) invites public comments on our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The information to be collected will be used by the Maritime Administration to evaluate and review applications being submitted for project designation. The review will assess factors such as project scope, impact, public benefit, environmental effect, offsetting costs, cost to the government (if any), the likelihood of long-term self-supporting operations, and its relationship with Marine Highway Routes once designated. We are required to publish this notice in the Federal Register by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
