## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Airbus Helicopters Model AS332C, AS332C1, AS332L, AS332L1, and AS332L2 helicopters. This AD requires removing the drain plugs from the fuel tank compartments located under the bottom structure. This AD was prompted by the discovery that a modification to the fuel tank could lead to fuel accumulating in an area containing electrical equipment and subsequent ignition of fuel vapors. The actions of this AD are intended to address an unsafe condition on these products.
