## Summary

The National Institute of Justice (NIJ) is soliciting information for an upcoming Criminal Justice Testing and Evaluation Consortium (CJTEC) report that will provide a functional overview of how law enforcement agencies can utilize technology to measure and monitor community perception, opinion, and/or satisfaction related to law enforcement, to improve police performance and overall community-police relations. The report will highlight the providers and vendors that are developing and offering technologies that measure/ monitor the community's perception, opinion, and/or satisfaction related to law enforcement. The report will also consider sentiment monitoring tools in terms of the broader context of the rapidly evolving marketplace for sentiment analysis products, including the monitoring of customers' perception of brands.
