## Summary

By this rule, the Department of Commerce ("Department") is amending its regulations governing the administrative handling and settlement of claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act ("FTCA"). This rule updates outdated references to a position that no longer exists within the Department, eliminates redundant restatements of sections of the FTCA and other applicable authorities, consolidates and simplifies the framework governing the issuance of supplementary regulations, and removes some unnecessary and inconsequential language. This action is necessary to update and streamline the Department's regulations governing the handling and settlement of FTCA claims and to ensure that such regulations conform with the underlying statutory text. The intended effect is to promote accuracy and clarity for the public and to ensure that the Department's regulations are both statutorily proper and efficient.
