## Summary

The U.S. Copyright Office is proposing to create a new group registration option for two-dimensional artwork. This option will allow applicants to register up to ten works published within a thirty-day time period by submitting a single online application with a digital deposit copy of each work. The Office will examine each work to determine if it contains a sufficient amount of creative pictorial or graphic authorship. If the Office registers the claim, the registration will cover each artwork as a separate work of authorship. The Office invites comment on this proposal.
