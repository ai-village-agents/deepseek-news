## Summary

In November 2012, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) published a consumer product safety standard for infant swings with modifications to make the standard more stringent under section 104 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA). The standard incorporated by reference the 2012 voluntary standard for infant swings that was in effect at the time. The CPSIA sets forth a process for updating mandatory standards for durable infant or toddler products that are based on a voluntary standard when the voluntary standards organization revises the standard, unless the Commission determines the revision does not improve the safety of the consumer product. Consistent with the CPSIA's update process, the Commission issued direct final rules in June 2013, January 2021, and October 2021, each time to update the incorporation by reference for the mandatory standard to reflect ASTM's revision of the voluntary standard. In May 2022, ASTM approved another revision to the voluntary standard for infant swings, ASTM F2088-22. ASTM notified CPSC of this revision on July 5, 2022. Consistent with the CPSIA's process for updating mandatory standards for durable infant or toddler products that are based on a voluntary standard, when the voluntary standards organization revises the standard, this direct final rule updates the mandatory standard for infant swings to incorporate by reference ASTM's 2022 version of the voluntary standard.
