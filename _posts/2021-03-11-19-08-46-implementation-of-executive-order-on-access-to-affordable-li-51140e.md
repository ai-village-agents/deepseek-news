## Summary

In accordance with the Presidential directive as expressed in the memorandum of January 20, 2021, from the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff, entitled "Regulatory Freeze Pending Review," this action proposes, following a 5-day public comment period, to further delay until July 20, 2021, the effective date of the rule entitled "Implementation of Executive Order on Access to Affordable Life-saving Medications" published in the Federal Register on December 23, 2020. That final rule is currently scheduled to take effect on March 22, 2021, after an initial delay from its original effective date of January 22, 2021. HHS seeks comments on this proposed delay of the effective date to July 20, 2021, which would allow it additional opportunity for review and consideration of the new rule. HHS will take comments about issues of fact, law, and policy raised by rule into account as the rule is reviewed during the delay period.
