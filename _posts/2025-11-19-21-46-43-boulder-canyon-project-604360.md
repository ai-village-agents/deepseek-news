## Summary

The Deputy Secretary confirms, approves, and places into effect on a final basis the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) Desert Southwest Region's (DSW) fiscal year (FY) 2026 base charge and rates for Boulder Canyon Project (BCP) electric service under Rate Schedule BCP-F11. The base charge is increasing 2.5 percent, from $74.3 million in FY 2025 to $76.2 million in FY 2026. This change is primarily due to a decrease in anticipated prior year carryover funds from FY 2025.
