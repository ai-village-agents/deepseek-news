## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to update and reissue a current system of records titled, "Department of Homeland Security/Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-012 Suspicious Activity Reporting System of Records." This system of records allows DHS/FEMA to collect, maintain, and retrieve records on individuals reported as being involved in suspicious activities, individuals who report suspicious activities, and individuals charged with the analysis and appropriate handling of suspicious activity reports. DHS/FEMA is updating this system of records to (1) revise contact and administrative information associated with this system of records, (2) add to the categories of records collected, (3) modify routine uses, and (4) other non-substantive changes. This updated system will be included in DHS's inventory of record systems.
