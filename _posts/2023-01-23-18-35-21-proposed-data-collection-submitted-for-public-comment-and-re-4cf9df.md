## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Information Collections to Advance State, Tribal, Local, and Territorial (STLT) Governmental Agency and System Performance, Capacity, and Program Delivery. This collection is used to assess situational awareness of current public health emergencies, make decisions that affect planning, response and recovery activities of subsequent emergencies, and fill CDC and HHS gaps in knowledge of programs and/or STLT governments that will strengthen surveillance, epidemiology, and laboratory science, as well as improve CDC's support and technical assistance to states and communities.
