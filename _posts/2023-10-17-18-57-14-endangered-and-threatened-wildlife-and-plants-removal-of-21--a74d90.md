## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service or USFWS), are removing 21 species from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife due to extinction. This action is based on a review of the best available scientific and commercial information, which indicates that these species are no longer extant and, as such, no longer meet the definition of an endangered species or a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act).
