## Summary

This proposal invites comments on changes to the representation of the National Mango Board (Board) under the Mango Promotion, Research and Information Order (Order). This action would allocate the seven foreign producer Board seats to the top five mango exporting countries, based on mango volume exported to the United States, with an additional seat allocated to the top exporting country, and one at-large seat. In addition, the proposal would require no more than one Board member be employed by or be affiliated with the same company. The Board administers the Order with oversight by Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). This rule was recommended by the Board and is issued with the concurrence of AMS.
