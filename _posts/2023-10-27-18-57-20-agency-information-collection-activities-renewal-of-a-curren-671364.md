## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FMCSA announces its plan to submit the Information Collection Request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review and approval and invites public comment. In order to work continuously to ensure that our programs are effective and meet our customers' needs, FMCSA requests approval to renew an ICR titled, "Generic Clearance of Customer Satisfaction Surveys." This ICR allows FMCSA to continue collecting feedback on our service delivery. By feedback, we mean information that provides useful insights on perceptions and opinions but are not statistical surveys that yield quantitative results that can be generalized to the population of study.
