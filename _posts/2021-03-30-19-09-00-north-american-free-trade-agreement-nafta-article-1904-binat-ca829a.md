## Summary

In Building Systems de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. v. United States, 476 F.Supp.3d 1401 (CIT, 2020) the Court of International Trade held that "it has jurisdiction over this proceeding because the requirements to request a binational panel, and divest this court of jurisdiction, have not been met." See also, Full Member Subgroup of American Institute of Steel Construction, LLC v. United States, 477 F.Supp.3d 1349 (CIT, 2020). Consistent with these holdings, there are no further proceedings for binational panel review in Certain Fabricated Structural Steel from Mexico AD (USA-MEX-2020-1904-01).
