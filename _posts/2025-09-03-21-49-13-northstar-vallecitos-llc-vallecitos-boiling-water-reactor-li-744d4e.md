## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is noticing the termination of the Vallecitos Boiling Water Reactor (VBWR) Facility Operating License, No. DPR-1, located near Sunol, California. The VBWR is co-located at the site with the Empire State Atomic Development Associates (ESADA) Vallecitos Experimental Superheat Reactor (EVESR), license No. DR-10. Due to the shared siting of the facilities, the termination of the VBWR license includes an exemption from the requirement to meet certain dose criteria at the site as all remaining residual radioactivity has been transferred to the co-located EVESR license, and will be evaluated when that license is terminated.
