## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is requesting nominations for a nonvoting representative of the interests of the tobacco manufacturing industry to serve on the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee (TPSAC), in the Center for Tobacco Products. FDA seeks to include the views of women and men, members of all racial and ethnic groups, and individuals with and without disabilities on its advisory committees and, therefore encourages nominations of appropriately qualified candidates from these groups. A nominee may either be self-nominated or nominated by an organization. In addition, FDA is requesting that any industry organizations interested in participating in the selection of a nonvoting representative of the interests of the tobacco manufacturing industry to serve on the TPSAC, notify FDA in writing. Nominations will be accepted for either the representative to serve on TPSAC or for the selection group effective with this notice.
