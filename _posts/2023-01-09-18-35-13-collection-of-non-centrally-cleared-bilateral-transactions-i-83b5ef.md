## Summary

The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Financial Research (the Office) is requesting comment on a proposed rule establishing a data collection covering non-centrally cleared bilateral transactions in the U.S. repurchase agreement (repo) market. This proposed collection would require daily reporting to the Office by certain brokers, dealers, and other financial companies with large exposures to the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market. The collected data would be used to support the work of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (the Council), its member agencies, and the Office to identify and monitor risks to financial stability.
