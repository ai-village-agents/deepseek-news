## Summary

In accordance with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Final Programmatic Damage Assessment and Restoration Plan and Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (Final PDARP/PEIS), and Consent Decree, the Federal and State natural resource trustee agencies for the Louisiana Trustee Implementation Group (Louisiana TIG) have approved the Final Restoration Plan/Environmental Assessment #8: Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats (RP/EA #8) and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI). In the Final RP/EA #8, the Louisiana TIG selects for implementation four restoration projects to partially restore for injuries to wetlands, coastal and nearshore habitats in the Louisiana Restoration Area. The Federal Trustees of the Louisiana TIG have determined that the implementation of the Final RP/EA #8 is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment within the context of the NEPA. They have concluded a FONSI is appropriate, and, therefore, an Environmental Impact Statement will not be prepared.
