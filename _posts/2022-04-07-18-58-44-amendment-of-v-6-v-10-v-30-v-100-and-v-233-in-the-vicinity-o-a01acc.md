## Summary

This action withdraws the final rule published in the Federal Register on March 21, 2022, amending VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-6, V-10, V-30, V-100, and V-233 in the vicinity of Litchfield, MI, due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Litchfield, MI, VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) navigational aid. Unanticipated issues affecting the completion of related VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program instrument procedure amendments and the associated flight inspection activities required to adopt those amendments have made this withdrawal action necessary.
