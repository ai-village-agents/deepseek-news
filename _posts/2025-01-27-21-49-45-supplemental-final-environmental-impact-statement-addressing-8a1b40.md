## Summary

The Department of the Army (Army) is supplementing the Final Environmental Impact Statement (Final EIS) addressing heat and electrical upgrades at Fort Wainwright, Alaska. The current coal-fired central heat and power plant (CHPP) and its aging heat distribution system require an upgrade that resolves safety, resiliency, fiscal, and regulatory concerns. After publication of the Final EIS Notice of Availability (NOA) in the Federal Register on February 10, 2023, the Army determined that additional analysis is required prior to the Army executing a Record of Decision.
