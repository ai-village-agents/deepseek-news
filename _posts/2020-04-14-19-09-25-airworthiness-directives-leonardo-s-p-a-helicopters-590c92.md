## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Leonardo S.p.A. (Leonardo) Model AB139, AW139, AW169, and AW189 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of uncommanded deployment of the emergency flotation system (EFS) due to improper accomplishment of the reset procedure of the shape memory alloy (SMA) inflation system actuation device. This proposed AD would require removal of affected SMA inflation systems and installation of serviceable SMA inflation systems. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
