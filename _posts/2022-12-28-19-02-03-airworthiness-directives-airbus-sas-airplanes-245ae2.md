## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A330-201, -202, -203, -301, -302, and -303 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of corrosion and cracks found on engine inlet attach fittings. This proposed AD would require an inspection to determine whether affected engine inlet attach fittings (brackets) are installed, and replacement of those affected engine inlet attach fittings or replacement with an inlet cowl having no affected engine inlet attach fittings, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
