## Summary

NMFS announces its intent to convene a workshop to solicit facts and information from experts to inform recovery planning for the Beringia Distinct Population Segment (DPS) bearded Seal (Erignathus barbatus nauticus) and the Arctic ringed seal (Phoca hispida hispida). We will not be asking for any consensus recommendations on how to recover these species. This workshop will be open to the public. We also request submission of information that might inform the development of the recovery plans.
