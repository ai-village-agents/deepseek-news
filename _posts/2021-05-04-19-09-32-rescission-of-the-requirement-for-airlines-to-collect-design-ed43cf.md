## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a component of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), announces the rescission of the requirement for airlines and aircraft operators to collect designated information for passengers who are departing from, or were otherwise present in, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) within 21 days prior to their entry or attempted entry into the United States. This rescission is based on the CDC Director's determination that such passengers are no longer at risk of exposure to Ebola virus disease (EVD) and that their accurate and complete contact information is no longer needed to protect the health of fellow travelers and United States communities. All requirements pertaining to Guinea remain in effect.
