## Summary

On December 7, 2021, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published a final rule in the Federal Register to extend the Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) prohibiting certain flights in the specified areas of the Sanaa Flight Information Region (FIR) (OYSC) by all: U.S. air carriers; U.S. commercial operators; persons exercising the privileges of an airman certificate issued by the FAA, except when such persons are operating U.S.-registered aircraft for a foreign air carrier; and operators of U.S.-registered civil aircraft, except when the operator of such aircraft is a foreign air carrier. Subsequently, the FAA became aware that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) amended waypoints the FAA uses to demarcate the boundary between the airspace in which U.S. operators are prohibited from conducting operations and the airspace in which U.S. operators are permitted to operate. The FAA is publishing this technical amendment to update its regulations to reflect the current waypoint names and locations.
