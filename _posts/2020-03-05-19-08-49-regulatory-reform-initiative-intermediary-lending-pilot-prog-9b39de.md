## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is proposing to remove three regulations governing the application and selection process for Intermediary Lending Pilot (ILP) program Intermediaries. These regulations are no longer necessary because SBA is no longer authorized to select new ILP Intermediaries. The removal of these regulations will assist the public by simplifying SBA's regulations. SBA is also proposing to make two conforming amendments to avoid confusion.
