## Summary

On September 26, 2024, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) solicited public comments on VA's plan to assess the current scientific literature and historical claims data regarding exposure to Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and kidney cancer. The notice provided an opportunity for veterans, caregivers, survivors, and the public to share relevant information with VA to inform decisions regarding presumptive benefits that could impact veterans who may have experienced environmental and/or occupational exposures to PFAS during military service. Additionally, VA held a virtual public listening session on November 19, 2024, for the public to provide feedback on the planned assessment. This notice provides VA's responses to comments received from the public.
