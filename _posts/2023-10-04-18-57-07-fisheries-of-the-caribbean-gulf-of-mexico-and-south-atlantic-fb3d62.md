## Summary

NMFS implements an accountability measure (AM) for the recreational harvest of gag in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) for the 2023 fishing year. NMFS has projected that the 2023 recreational annual catch limit (ACL) for gag will be reached by October 19, 2023. Therefore, NMFS closes the recreational sector for gag to protect the gag resource.
