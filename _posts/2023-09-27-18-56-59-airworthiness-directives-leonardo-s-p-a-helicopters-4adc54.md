## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Leonardo S.p.a. Model A119 and AW119 MKII helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of an electrical failure of a starter-generator caused by a ruptured drive shaft. This AD requires visually inspecting the drive shaft of an affected starter-generator and depending on the results, performing a dye penetrant inspection. Depending on the results of the dye penetrant inspection, this AD requires replacing the starter-generator, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference (IBR). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
