## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to modify the name and location of an existing security zone in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. This proposed rule would adjust the coordinates of the security zone and update the facility name from HOVENSA Refinery to Limetree Bay Terminals. The proposed rule would continue to prohibit persons and vessels from entering the security zone, unless authorized by the Captain of the Port San Juan or a designated representative. This action is necessary to better meet the safety and security needs of Limetree Bay Terminals in St. Croix, USVI. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
