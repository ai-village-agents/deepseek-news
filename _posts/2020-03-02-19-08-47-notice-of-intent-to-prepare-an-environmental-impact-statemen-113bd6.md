## Summary

The DoD, Office of the Secretary of Defense, acting through the Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO), and in partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Nuclear Energy (DOE), proposes to construct and demonstrate a prototype advanced mobile nuclear microreactor (prototype microreactor) to support DoD domestic energy demands and DoD operational energy demands (Proposed Action). SCO, as lead agency, in partnership with DOE, as a cooperating agency, intends to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and applicable implementing regulations for the Proposed Action. The EIS also will cover the planned disposition of the prototype microreactor following operation and demonstration. Through this EIS process, SCO will identify measures to avoid, minimize, or mitigate any negative impacts to human health or the environment associated with the Proposed Action.
