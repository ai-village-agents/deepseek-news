In accordance with the requirements of the PRA, the OCC may not conduct or sponsor, and the respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The OCC is soliciting comment concerning a revision to a currently approved information collection titled, "Conversions from Mutual to Stock Form." The OCC also is giving notice that it has sent the collection to OMB for review.
