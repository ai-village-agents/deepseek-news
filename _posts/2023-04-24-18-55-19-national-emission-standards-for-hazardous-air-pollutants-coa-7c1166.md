## Summary

The EPA is proposing to amend the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units (EGUs), commonly known as the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS). Specifically, the EPA is proposing to amend the surrogate standard for non-mercury (Hg) metal HAP (filterable particulate matter (fPM)) for existing coal-fired EGUs; the fPM compliance demonstration requirements; the Hg standard for lignite- fired EGUs; and the definition of startup. These proposed amendments are the result of the EPA's review of the May 22, 2020 residual risk and technology review (RTR) of MATS.
