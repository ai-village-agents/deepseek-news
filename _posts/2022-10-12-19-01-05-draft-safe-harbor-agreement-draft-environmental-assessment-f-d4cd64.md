## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, have received an application from Weyerhaeuser Timber Holdings, Inc., for an enhancement of survival permit (permit) pursuant to the Endangered Species Act. If granted, the permit would authorize incidental take of the marbled murrelet, associated with forest management actions on private lands. The application includes a draft safe harbor agreement (SHA), which describes the actions the applicant will take to achieve a net conservation benefit for the marbled murrelet within its range on enrolled lands in Washington. We announce the availability of a draft environmental assessment addressing the SHA and permit application. We invite comments from all interested parties.
