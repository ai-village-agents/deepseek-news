## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for turbocharged, reciprocating engine-powered airplanes and helicopters and turbocharged, reciprocating engines with a certain v-band coupling installed. This AD was prompted by multiple failures of spot-welded, multi-segment v-band couplings at the tailpipe to the turbocharger exhaust housing flange (also referred to as "spot-welded, multi- segment exhaust tailpipe v-band coupling"). This AD establishes a life limit for the spot-welded, multi-segment exhaust tailpipe v-band coupling and requires repetitively inspecting the spot-welded, multi- segment exhaust tailpipe v-band coupling. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
