## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) adopts a two-week "grace period" to allow Video Relay Service (VRS) and Internet Protocol Captioned Telephone Service (IP CTS) providers to commence service to new or porting-in users while the user's identity is verified by the Telecommunications Relay Services (TRS) User Registration Database. These actions will increase the efficiency of the registration process, avoid unnecessary service delays, and ensure that TRS users' experience in ordering new service or porting service to a new TRS provider is comparable to that of voice telephone service users.
