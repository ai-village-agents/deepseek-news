## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to remove the air pollution nuisance rule from the Ohio State Implementation Plan (SIP) using the Clean Air Act (CAA) error correction provision. EPA has determined that this rule was not relied upon by Ohio to demonstrate attainment or maintenance of any National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). If EPA takes final action consistent with this proposal, the nuisance provision will no longer be part of the Ohio SIP.
