## Summary

The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 governs the application, processing, and disposition of petitions for modification of mandatory safety standards. Any mine operator or representative of miners may petition for an alternative method of complying with an existing safety standard. MSHA reviews the content of each submitted petition, assesses the mine in question, and ultimately issues a decision on the petition. This notice includes a list of petitions for modification that were granted after MSHA's review and investigation, between July 1, 2024, and December 31, 2024.
