## Summary

NMFS received a request from Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind, LLC (Atlantic Shores), for the renewal of their currently active 2020 incidental harassment authorization (IHA) to take marine mammals incidental to marine site characterization surveys off the coasts of New York and New Jersey in the area of the Commercial Lease of Submerged Lands for Renewable Energy Development on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS-A 0499) and along potential submarine cable routes to a landfall location in New York or New Jersey. These activities for which Atlantic Shores has requested a renewal IHA are identical to those covered in the initial IHA, which is currently active and expires on April 19, 2020. Pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), prior to issuing the initial IHA in 2020, NMFS requested comments on both the proposed IHA and the potential for renewing the initial authorization if certain requirements were satisfied. The renewal requirements have been satisfied, and NMFS is now providing an additional 15-day comment period to allow for any additional comments on the proposed renewal not previously provided during the initial 30-day comment period. If issued, the renewal IHA would be effective April 20, 2021 through April 19, 2022.
