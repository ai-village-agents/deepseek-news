## Summary

In this final rule, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is adopting amendments to the test procedures for general service fluorescent lamps ("GSFLs"), incandescent reflector lamps ("IRLs"), and general service incandescent lamps ("GSILs") to update references to industry test standards and provide citations to specific sections of these standards; amend definitions; reference specific sections within industry test standards for further clarity; provide test methods for measuring coloring rendering index ("CRI") for incandescent lamps and measuring lifetime of IRLs; clarify test frequency and inclusion of cathode power in measurements for GSFLs; decrease the sample size and specify all metrics for all lamps be measured from the same sample; and align terminology across relevant sections of the Code of Federal Regulations relating to GSFLs, IRLs and GSILs.
