## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to conditionally approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by Michigan on December 20, 2022, and supplemented on February 21, 2023, which amends a SIP submission previously submitted to EPA on May 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, for attaining the 1-hour sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) primary national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for the Detroit SO<INF>2</INF> nonattainment area. If this action is finalized, EPA will propose to convert the conditional approval of the SIP revision to a full approval upon Michigan timely meeting its commitment to submit the issued permits.
