## Summary

The National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) has released a draft update to the Introduction Chapter of the Comprehensive Plan for the National Capital: Federal Elements for public review. The chapter establishes the planning framework for the Comprehensive Plan's Federal Elements to guide agency actions, including review of projects and long-range plans that affect federal buildings, installations, campuses, and master plans in the National Capital Region. The current Comprehensive Plan's Introduction Chapter was adopted in June 2024 and was updated in response to Executive Order (E.O.) 13985 (Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government). By way of E.O. 14148, E.O. 13985 was rescinded, and E.O. 14151 (Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing) was signed. Together, these orders required federal agencies to undo or amend agency regulations and policies that were made in accordance with E.O. 13985 or which focused on a similar purpose, thereby necessitating revisions to the Introduction Chapter. The draft update reverts the Comprehensive Plan's Introduction Chapter back to the version that existed prior to June 2024. The Introduction Chapter is available online at: https://www.ncpc.gov/ participate/notices/.
