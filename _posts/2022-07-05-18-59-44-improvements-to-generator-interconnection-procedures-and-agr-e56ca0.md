## Summary

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) proposing reforms to its pro forma Large Generator Interconnection Procedures, pro forma Small Generator Interconnection Procedures, pro forma Large Generator Interconnection Agreement, and pro forma Small Generator Interconnection Agreement to address interconnection queue backlogs, improve certainty, and prevent undue discrimination for new technologies. The reforms are intended to ensure that the generator interconnection process is just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential. The Commission invites all interested persons to submit comments on the proposed reforms, including proposed revisions to the pro forma interconnection procedures and agreements, and in response to specific questions.
