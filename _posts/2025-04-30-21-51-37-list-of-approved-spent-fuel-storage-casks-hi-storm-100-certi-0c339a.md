## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is confirming the effective date of May 27, 2025, for the direct final rule that was published in the Federal Register on March 13, 2025. This direct final rule amended the Holtec International HI-STORM 100 Cask System listing within the "List of approved spent fuel storage casks" to include Renewed Amendment No. 19 to Certificate of Compliance No. 1014. Renewed Amendment No. 19 revises the certificate of compliance to update the acceptance criteria and method of evaluation (MOE) for the HI-STORM 100 system tipover accident for equipment combinations involving multi- purpose canisters with Metamic-HT baskets. This involves applying a new stress-based criteria and completing new evaluations consistent with the new tipover acceptance criteria and MOE and involves some adjustments of the existing deflection criteria.
