## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff docketed an application for the amendment of Special Nuclear Materials (SNM) License No. SNM-1227, submitted by Framatome, Inc. dated January 20, 2025. This application was accepted on May 2, 2025. The amended license would authorize the applicant to modify the Framatome Fuel Fabrication Facility, located in Richland, Washington, to increase enrichment from 5.0 weight percent Uranium-235 (U-235) to less than 6.5 weight percent U-235. Because the amendment request contains Sensitive Unclassified Non-Safeguards Information (SUNSI) and Safeguards Information (SGI), an order imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI and SGI for contention preparation by persons who file a hearing request or petition for leave to intervene.
