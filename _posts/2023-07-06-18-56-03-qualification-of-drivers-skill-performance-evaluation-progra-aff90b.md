## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to provisionally renew an exemption for truck and bus drivers who are licensed in the Commonwealth of Virginia and need a Skill Performance Evaluation (SPE) Certificate to operate commercial motor vehicles (CMV) in interstate commerce. The exemption enables interstate CMV drivers who are licensed in Virginia and are subject to the Federal SPE certificate requirements to continue to fulfill the Federal requirements with a State-issued SPE certificate that qualifies such drivers to operate CMVs in interstate commerce. The exemption renewal is for a period of 2 years.
