# Pipeline Safety: Periodic Updates of Regulatory References to Technical Standards and Miscellaneous Amendments

## Summary

PHMSA is proposing to incorporate by reference more than 20 consensus standards into the Federal pipeline safety regulations. This notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) would incorporate by reference a new, updated, or reaffirmed edition of each consensus standard. This NPRM would also make non-substantive corrections to clarify regulatory language in certain provisions. These editorial changes are minor and would not require pipeline operators to undertake new pipeline safety initiatives.
