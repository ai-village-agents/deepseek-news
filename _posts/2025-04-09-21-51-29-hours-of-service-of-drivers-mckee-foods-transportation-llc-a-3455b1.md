## Summary

FMCSA announces its final decision to renew the exemption granted to McKee Foods Transportation, LLC (MFT), USDOT #1025678, from the hours-of-service (HOS) regulations pertaining to the use of a sleeper berth. The exemption renewal allows MFT team drivers to take the equivalent of 10 consecutive hours off duty by splitting sleeper berth time into two periods totaling 10 hours, provided neither of the two periods is less than two hours. FMCSA has analyzed the exemption application and the public comments and has determined that the exemption, subject to the terms and conditions set forth below, is likely to achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to or greater than the level that would be achieved absent such exemption.
