## Summary

In response to EPA's August 2021 final rule revoking all tolerances for the insecticide chlorpyrifos under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), several objections, hearing requests, and requests for stay were filed by numerous parties representing a wide variety of growers and pesticide users. In this Order, EPA denies all objections to, requests for hearing on those objections, as well as requests for stay of the final rule.
