## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is seeking Tribal consultation on "The Tribal Representation Expansion Project (T. REP)", a project through which VA strives to ensure that Native American Veterans have access to responsible, qualified representation in the preparation, presentation, and prosecution of their benefit claims before VA. VA is seeking comments on whether Tribal communities currently have access to representation for VA benefit claims and, for those Tribes that are being underserved in terms of representation, whether the Tribal governments may be interested in collaborating with VA to designate an individual within the community as authorized to prepare, present, and prosecute VA benefit claims. In addition, VA is seeking comments and recommendations on any issues, concerns, or processes the Tribes believe should be addressed in T. REP to better ensure that the project is successful in helping to expand access to representation for Native American Veterans on their benefit claims before VA.
