## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-20- 10, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; Model A319-111, -112,-113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2019-20-10 required repetitive rototest inspections of the holes at the door stop fittings for any cracking, and corrective actions if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2019-20-10, a clarification of a certain compliance time for the rototest inspection was added. This AD clarifies a certain compliance time and continues to require repetitive rototest inspections of the holes at the door stop fittings for any cracking, and repair if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
