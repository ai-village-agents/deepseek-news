## Summary

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) intends to prepare a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) for the Pearl River Flood Risk Management Project in Rankin and Hinds Counties, Mississippi to analyze flood risk management plans that can be implemented under section 3104 of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2007. This notice updates the original Notice of Intent declaring the Rankin- Hinds Pearl River Flood and Drainage Control District, the non-Federal interest (NFI) and USACE's intent to conduct a Feasibility Study and EIS process, which was published in the Federal Register on July 25, 2013. USACE is now preparing a DEIS to identify the national economic development (NED) plan by comparing the level of flood protection provided by the alternatives presented in the NFI's section 211 Study (Alternatives A and C) and two new USACE alternatives (Alternative A1 and Combination/Hybrid Plan, as allowed for by section 3104); assess the environmental acceptability and technical feasibility of the alternatives; and provide the Secretary the necessary information to choose a plan to implement. Additionally, consistent with section 1176 of WRDA 2018, the DEIS will assess potential downstream impacts to the Pearl River Basin.
