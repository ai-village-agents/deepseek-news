## Summary

Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as implemented by the Council on Environmental Quality, the Department of the Navy (DoN) announces its intent to prepare a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) to update its analysis in the 1999 Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for Developing Home Port Facilities for Three Nimitz-Class Aircraft Carriers in Support of the U.S. Pacific Fleet and its 2008 Final SEIS. The new SEIS will address current mission objectives, routine pier-side maintenance activities and proposed electrical shoreside power infrastructure, which may result in three CVNs being simultaneously in port at Naval Air Station North Island (NASNI) for more intermittent, nonconsecutive days per year than analyzed in prior NEPA documents. The DON is initiating a 45-day public scoping process to receive comments on the scope of the SEIS, including identification of potential alternatives, information, and analyses relevant to the Proposed Action, identification of environmental concerns, issues the public would like to see addressed in the SEIS, and the project's potential to affect historic properties pursuant to section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966.
