## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) issues this final rule amending its regulations addressing when VA will allow individuals and VA recognized service organizations who are assisting claimants in the preparation, presentation, and prosecution of their benefit claims before VA to access specific VA's information technology (IT) systems to review VA records relevant to their clients' claims. This final rule addresses who is permitted, and under what circumstances, to directly access VA records and other claims-related information through specific VA IT systems during representation of a claimant in a claim for VA benefits. This rule also outlines the appropriate behavior while using VA's IT systems to access records and the consequences for individuals who mishandle such access. This rulemaking, however, does not address general issues involving management of access to VA physical facilities or VA's disclosure of claimants' private information through any means other than direct access to the specific VA IT systems.
