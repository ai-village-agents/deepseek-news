## Summary

We find that, under the Alien Nonpayment Provision of the Social Security Act (Act), citizens of Cambodia may continue to receive Social Security benefits under title II, after 6 consecutive months of absence from the United States, without regard to length of absence, if they meet certain conditions. This finding is based on our analysis of information and data we received about the social insurance system of Cambodia and its laws. The Commissioner of Social Security delegated the authority to make this finding to the Deputy Commissioner for Retirement and Disability Policy.
