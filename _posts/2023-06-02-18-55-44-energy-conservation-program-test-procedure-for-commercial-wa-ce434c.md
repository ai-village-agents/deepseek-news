## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is amending the Federal test procedures for commercial warm air furnaces (CWAFs) to incorporate the latest versions of the industry test standards that are currently incorporated by reference. DOE is also establishing a new metric, Thermal Efficiency Two (TE2), and corresponding test procedure. Use of the newly established test procedure would become mandatory at such time as compliance with amended energy conservation standards based on TE2 is required, should DOE adopt such standards. DOE also is adopting additional specifications for CWAFs with multiple flue outlets or small flue outlets.
