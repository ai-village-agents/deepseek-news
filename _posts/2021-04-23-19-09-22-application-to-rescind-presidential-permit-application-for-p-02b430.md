## Summary

Versant Power (formerly Emera Maine, legacy of Maine Public Service Company) has filed an application to effect a voluntary transfer of Presidential Permit No. PP-81 to its name, via the Department of Energy's (DOE) rescission and simultaneous reissuance of the permit. Versant Power owns the facilities authorized for cross- border electric power transmission by Presidential Permit No. PP-81. The named permittee is Maine Public Service Company, which became Emera Maine following a corporate merger on January 1, 2014, but without a concurrent change to the name on the permit. As a result of another corporate transaction in March 2020, Emera Maine's parent company came under new ownership; Emera Maine was required to change its name and became Versant Power. The application therefore requests that DOE rescind Presidential Permit No. PP-81 and simultaneously issue a permit, in Versant Power's name, covering the same international transmission facilities.
