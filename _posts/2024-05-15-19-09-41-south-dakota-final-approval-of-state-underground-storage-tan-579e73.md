## Summary

The State of South Dakota Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources (DANR) has applied to the EPA for final approval of the changes to its Underground Storage Tank (UST) program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The EPA has reviewed South Dakota's application and determined that South Dakota's UST program revisions satisfy all requirements needed for program approval. This action also codifies the EPA's approval of South Dakota's State program and incorporates by reference those provisions of the State's regulations that we have determined meet the requirements for approval.
