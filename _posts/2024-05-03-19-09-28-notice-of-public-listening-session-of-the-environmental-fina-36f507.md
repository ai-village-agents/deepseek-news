## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announces a public listening session via a webcast of the Environmental Financial Advisory Board (EFAB) Water Reuse Tax Incentive Workgroup. The listening session will be held in real-time via webcast and public comments may be provided in writing in advance. Please see SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION for further details. The purpose of the listening session will be for the EFAB to solicit public comment to inform its formulation of recommendations to the EPA on the public benefit of a potential Federal investment tax credit to support private investment in water reuse and recycling systems. An investment tax credit would focus on encouraging investment in equipment at privately owned industrial facilities to enable the use of municipally provided recycled water and/or enable onsite treatment and reuse of different sources of water within an industrial facility. The Board seeks public comment on how a potential investment tax credit could be structured to achieve the maximum public benefit and minimize any externalities or unintended consequences, and how that structure may differ for industrial onsite reuse versus industrial use of treated recycled water. The listening session will be conducted fully virtual via webcast.
