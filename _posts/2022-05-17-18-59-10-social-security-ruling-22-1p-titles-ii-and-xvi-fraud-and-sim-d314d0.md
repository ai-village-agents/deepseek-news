## Summary

We are providing notice of SSR 22-1p. This ruling rescinds and replaces SSR 16-1p and explains the revised process we will use to redetermine an individual's entitlement to benefits or eligibility for payments under titles II or XVI of the Social Security Act (Act) when there is reason to believe that fraud or similar fault was involved in that individual's original application for benefits or payments. We are revising the evidentiary standard for fraud and similar fault from a "preponderance of the evidence" to "reason to believe" to align more closely with the standard provided in the Act. We are also providing a new procedure at the hearings level of our administrative review process. The procedure provides that, before we disregard evidence under the Act at the hearings level of our administrative review process, we will consider the individual's objection to the disregarding of that evidence. We expect that these revised procedures will allow us to implement relevant sections of the Act in a manner consistent with the decisions of the Courts of Appeals that have considered legal challenges to the procedures outlined in SSR 16-1p.
