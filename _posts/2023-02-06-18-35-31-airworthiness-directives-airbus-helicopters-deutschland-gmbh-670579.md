## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (AHD) Model BO-105A, BO-105C, BO- 105S, BO-105LS A-1, BO-105LS A-3, MBB-BK 117 A-1, MBB-BK 117 A-3, MBB- BK 117 A-4, MBB-BK 117 B-1, MBB-BK 117 B-2, MBB-BK 117 C-1, MBB-BK 117 C-2, and MBB-BK 117 D-2 helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of a missing main rotor swashplate (swashplate) inner ring (inner ring). This AD requires inspecting for the presence of the inner ring and, depending on the results, accomplishing additional actions. This AD also prohibits installing an affected swashplate unless it is determined that the inner ring is installed, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
