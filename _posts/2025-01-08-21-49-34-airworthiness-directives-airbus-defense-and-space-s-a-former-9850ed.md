## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Defense and Space S.A. Model CN-235, CN-235-200, and CN-235-300 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a torn bulkhead seal found jamming the nose landing gear (NLG) emergency cable pulley. Due to the similarity of design, the main landing gear (MLG) emergency cable pulley could be exposed to the same failure mode. This AD requires repetitive inspections and corrective actions for damage of affected bulkhead seals and retainer rings, and repetitive replacement of affected parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
