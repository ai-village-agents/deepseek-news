## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A330-200 series; A330-200 Freighter series; A330-300 series; A330-800 series; A330-900 series; A340-200 series; and A340-300 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of cracks found in the scroll housing assembly of Honeywell GTCP331-350 auxiliary power units (APUs). This AD requires replacing each affected APU or re- identifying certain APU scroll housing assemblies, and prohibits the installation of affected parts under certain conditions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
