## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2016-18-09, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A318, A319, and A320 series airplanes. AD 2016-18-09 requires repetitive detailed inspections for damage on the fuselage skin at certain frames, and applicable related investigative and corrective actions. Since the FAA issued AD 2016-18-09, additional chafing of the forward fuselage underneath the fairing structure was found. Investigation revealed the cause as contact between the belly fairing nut plate and the fuselage. This proposed AD would continue to require repetitive inspections of the fuselage skin for chafing damage at certain frames using a new inspection process, and corrective actions if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which will be incorporated by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
