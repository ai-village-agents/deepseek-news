## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-2A12 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that the baggage bay line fire extinguishing tube assembly might not have been installed with the correct torque. This AD requires re-torqueing the baggage bay line fire extinguishing tube assembly to the correct torque values, and applying corrosion inhibiting compound on the discharge tubes. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
