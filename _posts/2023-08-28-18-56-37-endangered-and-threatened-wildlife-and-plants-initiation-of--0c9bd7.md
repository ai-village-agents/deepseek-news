## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, published a notice in the Federal Register of August 17, 2023, initiating 5-year status reviews of 47 species in California, Nevada, and Oregon under the Endangered Species Act. We inadvertently included one species in error. We are correcting the notice to remove that species.
