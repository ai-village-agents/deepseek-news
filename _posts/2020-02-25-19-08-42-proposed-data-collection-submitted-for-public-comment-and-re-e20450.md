## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled "Occupational Driver Safety at Intersections." The purpose of this data collection is to gather experimental information in the CDC Motor Vehicle Safety Research Laboratory on the effects of occupation, vehicle type, vehicle approach speed, signal light logic, and emergency response status on emergency vehicle driver decision-making at intersections. The information will also be used to formulate science-based safety recognition training materials and an advanced driver assistant tool to enhance occupational driver (e.g., law enforcement officers and firefighters) safety at intersections.
