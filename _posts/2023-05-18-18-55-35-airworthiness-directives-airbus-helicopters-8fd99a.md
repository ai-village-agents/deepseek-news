## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Helicopters (Airbus) Model AS332C, AS332C1, AS332L, AS332L1, AS332L2, and EC225LP helicopters. This AD is prompted by modifications developed by Airbus to address a report of an emergency exit window that required excessive pushing force to jettison. This AD requires removing skived polytetrafluoroethylene tape (PTFE tape) (if installed) and replacing certain polychloroprene seals with silicone seals, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also prohibits installing a jettisonable window unless the actions required by this AD have been accomplished. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
