## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is amending its August 7, 2000, Record of Decision (ROD) to the Savannah River Site Spent Nuclear Fuel Management Final Environmental Impact Statement (DOE/EIS-0279, DOE 2000, SRS SNF EIS). The changes to the August 7, 2000, ROD memorialize DOE's decision to manage approximately 29.2 metric tons of heavy metal (MTHM) of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and target materials (hereafter referred to collectively as SNF), using conventional processing without recovery of uranium at the H-Canyon facility at the Savannah River Site (SRS). DOE anticipates that processing this SNF would begin in 2022 and continue for approximately 12 to 13 years. DOE will send the dissolved material to the liquid high-level radioactive waste (HLW) system prior to immobilization the material in a borosilicate glass waste form in the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). In the meantime, DOE will continue to safely store SNF and target materials in L-Basin at SRS, pending processing in H-Canyon.
