## Summary

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing amendments to support FLTCIP program stability and flexibility by amending when abbreviated underwriting will be offered to prospective enrollees and proposing rules for the suspension of applications for coverage and the requirements around any such suspension periods. OPM is also proposing technical corrections for the sake of clarity and to remove redundancies. Finally, with the publication of this rule, OPM is also providing notice of an anticipated suspension period.
