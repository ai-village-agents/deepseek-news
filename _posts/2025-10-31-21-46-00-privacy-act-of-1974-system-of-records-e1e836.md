## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to modify and reissue a DHS system of records notice (SORN) titled, "Department of Homeland Security/U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)-004 Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program (SAVE)." As described in this modified SORN, USCIS, an agency within DHS, collects and maintains records on applicants for public benefits, licenses, grants, governmental credentials, and other statutorily authorized purposes through the SAVE program. SAVE allows registered user agencies to verify the immigration status/category ("immigration status") and U.S. citizenship (including for U.S. citizens by birth, naturalized and certain acquired citizens) of individuals applying for or receiving a public benefit, license or other authorized purpose ("benefit"). "Acquired citizenship" refers to U.S. citizenship conveyed to children through the naturalization of parents or, under certain circumstances, at birth to foreign-born children of U.S. citizens, provided certain conditions are met. DHS/USCIS is updating this SORN to include updates and modifications to the (1) purpose(s) of the system, (2) categories of individuals covered by the system, (3) categories of records in the system, (4) records source categories, and (5) routine uses of records maintained in the system. Additionally, this notice includes non-substantive changes to simplify the formatting and text of the previously published notice. This modified system will be included in DHS's inventory of record systems.
