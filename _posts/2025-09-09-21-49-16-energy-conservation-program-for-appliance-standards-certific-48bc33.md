## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is publishing this final rule to rescind and amend the certification provisions, labeling requirements, and enforcement provisions for specific types of consumer products and commercial and industrial equipment addressed in its final rule published in the Federal Register on October 9, 2024. DOE is undertaking this action because the October 9, 2024 final rule was the subject of a joint resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), which was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate and subsequently signed by the President on May 9, 2025, after which it became law. Because the October 9, 2024 final rule has no force or effect, DOE has a nondiscretionary duty to remove the associated provisions from the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), and through this final rule, DOE is taking the necessary action to effect such rescission.
