## Summary

This document sets forth proposed regulations that would amend the continuing professional education requirements for actuaries enrolled by the Joint Board for the Enrollment of Actuaries (Joint Board). These proposed regulations would remove the physical presence requirement for formal continuing professional education programs required for active enrolled actuaries and the physical location requirement from course certifications. These proposed regulations also would modify the continuing professional education requirement for certain actuaries who seek to return to active enrollment from inactive status due to their failure to timely satisfy the renewal requirements in the first enrollment cycle after their initial enrollment cycle. Finally, the proposed regulations would add a requirement that certificates of instruction for continuing professional education courses include the number of hours counted towards the required number of hours for formal programs. These proposed regulations solely address the enrollment rules of the Joint Board and do not affect pension plans, plan participants, or the general public.
