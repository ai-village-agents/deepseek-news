## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary security zone for navigable waters surrounding the Port of Cleveland, First Energy Stadium, The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and Voinovich Bicentennial Park from east of the Cuyahoga River entrance to west of the Voinovich Bicentennial Park and outward from shore, including inlets, to the navigation channel as marked by navigation buoys, but not including the channel. The security zone is needed to protect the public, participants, and spectators of the 2021 NFL Draft from terrorist and similar criminal acts, accidents, or other incidents detrimental to public safety. Entry of persons, vessels or objects into this zone when under enforcement is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port Buffalo or her representative.
