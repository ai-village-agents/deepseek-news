## Summary

The FAA announces the availability of recommendations from the CPR IAWG. In December of 2020, Congress passed the Aircraft Certification, Safety, and Accountability Act (ACSAA). Section 117 of the ACSAA required the FAA to form an international team to address areas of concern related to the CPR. The CPR IAWG has recommended specific areas where engagement with the public would be beneficial and broaden the scope of the discussions to a wider audience. The FAA plans to solicit public input at a public meeting which will be announced in a future notice.
