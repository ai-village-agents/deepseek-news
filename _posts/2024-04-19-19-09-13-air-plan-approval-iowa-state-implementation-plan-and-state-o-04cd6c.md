## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve revisions to the Iowa State Implementation Plan (SIP) and the Operating Permit Program for the State of Iowa. The revisions update incorporations by reference to EPA methods for performance testing (stack testing), update the definitions, and adopt the most recent National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone. These revisions do not impact the stringency of the SIP or have an adverse effect on air quality. The EPA's approval of this rule revision is being done in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
