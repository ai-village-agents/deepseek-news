## Summary

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has received a petition submitted on behalf of a domestic interested party requesting the reclassification, under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), of certain cane sugar molasses and liquid sugar. CBP currently classifies the subject cane sugar molasses under subheading 1703.10.30, HTSUS, as molasses, and the liquid sugar under subheading 1702.90.40, HTSUS. Petitioner contends that the proper classification for the subject cane sugar molasses and liquid sugar is under subheading 1702.90.10, HTSUS, or subheading 1702.90.20, HTSUS, as "sugar syrups." This document invites comments regarding the correctness of the current classification.
