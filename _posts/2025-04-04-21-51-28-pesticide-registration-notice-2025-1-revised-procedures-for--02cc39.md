## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is announcing the availability of Pesticide Registration Notice (PR Notice) 2025-1, entitled "Revised Procedures for Citing Data to Support Pesticide Registrations (EPA Forms No. 8570-34 and 8570-35)." PR Notices are issued by the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) to inform pesticide registrants and other interested persons about important policies, procedures, and registration related decisions, and serve to provide guidance to pesticide registrants and OPP personnel. This PR Notice supersedes PR Notice 98-5, entitled "New forms for the Certification with Respect to Citation of Data" dated June 12, 1998. The revised procedures eliminate the requirement to submit two paper versions of the completed data matrix form and establishes electronic online submissions. EPA anticipates that these changes will reduce burden for the registrants and the Agency.
