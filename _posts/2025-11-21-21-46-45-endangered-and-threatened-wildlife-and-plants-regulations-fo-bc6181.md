## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS or the Service), propose to amend portions of our regulations for section 4 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act or ESA). Specifically, we propose to revise regulations related to section 4(b)(2) of the Act. Section 4(b)(2) requires consideration of the economic impact, the impact on national security, and any other relevant impact of designating any particular area as critical habitat; and authorizes the exclusion of areas from critical habitat if the benefits of excluding the area outweigh the benefits of designating it as critical habitat. These proposed revisions articulate when and how we determine whether the benefits of excluding an area outweigh the benefits of designating the area as critical habitat (exclusion analysis). This proposed rule reflects the Service's experience and existing case law. The intended effect of this proposed rule is to provide greater transparency and certainty for the public and stakeholders.
