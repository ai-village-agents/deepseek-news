## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to partially approve and partially disapprove a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Tennessee, through the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC), on November 19, 2016, as supplemented on January 20, 2023, in response to a finding of substantial inadequacy and SIP call published on June 12, 2015, regarding provisions in the Tennessee SIP related to excess emissions during startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) events. Tennessee's January 20, 2023, supplemental SIP revision includes some additional changes related to the 2015 SIP call, plus other changes unrelated to the SIP call, in the affected chapter of Tennessee's regulations. EPA is proposing to approve portions of the November 19, 2016, SIP revision, as supplemented by the January 20, 2023, SIP revision, that the Agency has preliminarily determined correct certain deficiencies identified in the June 12, 2015, SIP SSM call. In addition, EPA is proposing to disapprove portions of the SIP revision that the Agency has preliminarily determined fail to correct other deficiencies identified in the 2015 SIP call.
