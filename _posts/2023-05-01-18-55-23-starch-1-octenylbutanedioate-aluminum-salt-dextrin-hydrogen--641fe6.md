## Summary

This regulation establishes exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of starch, 1-octenylbutanedioate, aluminum salt; dextrin, hydrogen 1-octenylbutanedioate; and amylopectin, 2- hydroxypropyl ether, acid- when used as inert ingredients (for seed treatment only) in pesticide formulations applied pre-harvest. Ingredion Incorporated submitted petitions to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting establishment of exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish maximum permissible levels for residues of starch, 1-octenylbutanedioate, aluminum salt; dextrin, hydrogen 1-octenylbutanedioate; and amylopectin, 2-hydroxypropyl ether, acid- when used in accordance with the terms of the exemptions.
