## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) found acceptable for docketing and is considering an application for the renewal of Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-80 and DPR-82, which authorize Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E, the applicant) to operate Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant (DCPP), Units 1 and 2. The current operating licenses for DCPP expire as follows: Unit 1 on November 2, 2024, and Unit 2 on August 26, 2025. If renewed, the renewed licenses would authorize the applicant to operate DCPP for an additional 20 years beyond the period specified in each of the current licenses.
