## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-100-1A10 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by an in-service event where the nose gear door amber caution message displayed on the crew alerting system during the initial climb after gear retraction. This proposed AD would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
