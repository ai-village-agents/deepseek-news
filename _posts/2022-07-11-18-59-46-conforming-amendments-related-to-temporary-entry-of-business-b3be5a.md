## Summary

This final rule amends the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regulations relating to the temporary entry of Canadian and Mexican citizen business persons into the United States by replacing references to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with references to the Agreement Between the United States of America, the United Mexican States, and Canada (USMCA). The USMCA superseded NAFTA and its related provisions on July 1, 2020. Chapter 16 of the USMCA generally maintains the same treatment as provided under NAFTA with respect to the temporary entry of Canadian and Mexican citizen business persons, so substantive changes to the regulations are not needed. This document simply updates the relevant regulations to replace all references to NAFTA, including references to its appendices and annexes, with the corresponding USMCA references. This document also makes other minor, non-substantive conforming amendments and stylistic changes and corrects typographical errors.
