## Summary

The Department of Transportation (DOT) invites public comments on our intention to request Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for an information collection in accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The collection is necessary for administration of the "Discretionary Grants for Nationally Significant Multimodal Freight and Highway Projects (INFRA) Program". INFRA grants support surface transportation infrastructure projects that have a significant local or regional impact.
