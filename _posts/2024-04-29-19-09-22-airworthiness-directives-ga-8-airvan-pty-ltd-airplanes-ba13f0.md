## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2010-18- 06, which applied to all GA8 Airvan (Pty) Ltd Model GA8 and GA8-TC320 airplanes. AD 2010-18-06 required inspections and a minor design change to the forward slide of the cargo door with corrective action as necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2010-18-06, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA), which is the aviation authority for Australia, superseded the previous CASA Australia AD to incorporate more detailed inspections and additional modifications as specified in updated service information published by the manufacturer. This AD was prompted by reports of in-flight cargo door separation. This AD requires inspections and rework (modifications) of the cargo door with corrective action as necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
