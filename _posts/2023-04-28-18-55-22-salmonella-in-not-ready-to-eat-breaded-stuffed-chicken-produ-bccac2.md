## Summary

The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is proposing to declare that not-ready-to-eat (NRTE) breaded stuffed chicken products that contain Salmonella at levels of 1 colony forming unit (CFU) per gram or higher are adulterated within the meaning of the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA). Although the labeling of these products has undergone significant changes over time to better inform consumers that they are raw and to provide instructions on how to prepare them safely, NRTE breaded stuffed chicken products continue to be associated with Salmonella illness outbreaks. Therefore, FSIS has concluded that public health measures that focus primarily on product labeling and consumer handling practices have not been effective in preventing additional foodborne illnesses associated with NRTE breaded stuffed chicken products. FSIS is also proposing to carry out verification procedures, including sampling and testing of the chicken component of these products prior to stuffing and breading, to ensure producing establishments control Salmonella in these products.
