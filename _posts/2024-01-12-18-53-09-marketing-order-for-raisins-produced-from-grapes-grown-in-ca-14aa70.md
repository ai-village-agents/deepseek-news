## Summary

Notice is hereby given of a public hearing to receive evidence on proposals recommended by the Raisin Administrative Committee (Committee) to amend Federal Marketing Order No. 989 (Order). The proposed amendments would reduce Committee membership, eliminate the designated cooperative bargaining association member seat, lower quorum requirements, remove producer district representation, remove the requirement for separate member and alternate nominations, remove factors for establishing marketing policy, add language to clarify the quality of reconditioned raisins, add authority to accept voluntary contributions, and add language regarding ownership of intellectual property. The Committee recommended the proposed amendments after determining a significant reduction in the size of the industry has made it increasingly difficult to fill Committee positions and conduct business. The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) also proposes to make additional changes to the Order as may be necessary to conform to any amendatory changes that result from the hearing.
