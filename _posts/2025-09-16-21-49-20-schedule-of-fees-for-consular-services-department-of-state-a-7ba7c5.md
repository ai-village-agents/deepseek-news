## Summary

The Department of State ("Department") proposes an adjustment to the Schedule of Fees for Consular Services of the Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs ("Schedule of Fees" or "Schedule") to establish a $1 fee to register for the Diversity Visa lottery program. This change will more fairly place the burden of the lottery registration on individuals seeking the benefit of gaining access to the DV application process instead of charging only the small percentage of successful registrants for the costs associated with administering the lottery program for all registrants. To effect this change to the DV program, the Department is also amending its regulations to note that an electronic registration fee will be collected at the time of registration.
