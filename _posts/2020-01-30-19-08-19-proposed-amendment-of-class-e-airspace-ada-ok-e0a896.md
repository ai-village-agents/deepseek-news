## Summary

This action proposes to amend Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Ada Regional Airport, Ada, OK. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of the decommissioning of the Ada VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) navigation aid, which provided navigation information for the instrument procedures at this airport. The name of the airport would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database. Airspace redesign is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at this airport.
