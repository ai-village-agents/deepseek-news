## Summary

This action amends VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-37 and V-270, and removes VOR Federal airway V-43, in the vicinity of Erie, Pennsylvania. The airway amendments are necessary due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Erie, PA, VOR/ Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC), which provides navigational guidance for these airways. The Erie VOR is being decommissioned as part of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
