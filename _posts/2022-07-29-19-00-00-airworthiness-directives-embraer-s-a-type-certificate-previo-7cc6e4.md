## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-08- 07, which applied to all Embraer S.A. Model ERJ 170-100 STD, -100 LR, - 100 SU, and -100 SE airplanes; Model ERJ 170-200 STD, -200 LR, and -200 SU airplanes; Model ERJ 190-100 STD, -100 LR, -100 IGW, and -100 ECJ airplanes; and Model ERJ 190-200 STD, -200 LR, and -200 IGW airplanes. AD 2022-08-07 required determining if certain NORDAM passenger windows are installed, inspecting affected parts for cracks, and replacing cracked parts. AD 2022-08-07 also required repetitive inspections of uncracked affected parts until all affected parts are replaced. This AD was prompted by a determination that additional airplanes are affected by the unsafe condition identified in AD 2022-08-07. This AD retains certain requirements of AD 2022-08-07, revises the applicability of AD 2022-08-07 to include the affected parts for clarification, and adds a certain airplane model to the applicability. This AD also prohibits the installation of affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
