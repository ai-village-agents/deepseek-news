## Summary

The Commission hereby gives notice of the scheduling of the final phase of antidumping and countervailing duty investigation Nos. 701-TA-755-756 and 731-TA-1734-1736 (Final) pursuant to the Tariff Act of 1930 to determine whether an industry in the United States is materially injured or threatened with material injury, or the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded, by reason of imports of chassis and subassemblies from Mexico, Thailand, and Vietnam, provided for in subheadings 8716.39.00 and 8716.90.50 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, preliminarily determined by the Department of Commerce ("Commerce") to be sold at less-than-fair-value and imports of such products from Mexico and Thailand preliminarily determined by Commerce to be subsidized. Due to the lapse in appropriations and ensuing cessation of Commission operations, the Commission has tolled all statutory and other investigative deadlines to account for the shutdown and resumption of activities.
