# Medicare Program; FY 2021 Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities Prospective Payment System (IPF PPS)

## Summary

This proposed rule would update the prospective payment rates, the outlier threshold, and the wage index for Medicare inpatient hospital services provided by Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities (IPF), which include psychiatric hospitals and excluded psychiatric units of an Inpatient Prospective Payment System hospital or critical access hospital. In addition, this proposed rule would adopt the most recent Office of Management and Budget (OMB) statistical area delineations, and apply a 2-year transition for all providers negatively impacted by wage index changes. These changes would be effective for IPF discharges beginning during the FY from October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 (FY 2021).
