## Summary

DHS is publishing official notification that the Transportation Security Oversight Board (TSOB) has ratified Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Security Directive Pipeline-2021-01B and Security Directive Pipeline-2021-02C applicable to owners and operators of critical oil and natural gas pipeline infrastructure (owner/operators). Security Directive Pipeline-2021-01B extended the expiration date of cybersecurity measures initially required by Security Directive Pipeline-2021-01, issued on May 27, 2022, for an additional year. Security Directive Pipeline-2021-02C revised the cybersecurity measures originally required by Security Directive Pipeline-2021-02, issued on July 19, 2021, to be more performance-based and less prescriptive than the original requirements. This performance-based approach ensures the mandated critical security outcomes are achieved while allowing covered owner/operators options to implement security measures for their specific systems and operations.
