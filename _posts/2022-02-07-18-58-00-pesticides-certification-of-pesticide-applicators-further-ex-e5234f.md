## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to extend the deadline by which Federal, State, territory, and tribal certifying authorities with existing certification plans are required to revise their existing certification plans to conform with the updated Federal standards for the certification of applicators of restricted use pesticides (RUPs) up to but not longer than November 4, 2024. Federal, State, territory, and tribal certifying authorities with existing certification plans are required to revise their existing certification plans to conform with the updated Federal standards for the certification of applicators of RUPs and the regulations established the deadline by which the existing plans are set to expire unless the revised plans are approved by the Agency. EPA is proposing this extension to allow additional time for proposed certification plan modifications to continue being reviewed and approved by EPA without interruption to Federal, State, territory, and tribal certification programs or to those who are certified to use RUPs under those programs.
