## Summary

Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974 and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-108, notice is hereby given that the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights (OASCR), a component within the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA or "the Department"), proposes to develop a new system of records notice titled, "USDA Reasonable Accommodations and Personal Assistance Services (RAPAS)." USDA/RAPAS-01 proposes to establish this system of records to allow USDA and its mission areas and agencies to collect and maintain records on: Applicants for employment who have disabilities; individuals with disabilities to facilitate their participation in a USDA program or activity, including attendance at a meeting, training, conference or other USDA-sponsored event at either a USDA facility or outside USDA employees who seek accommodations to allow them to perform the essential functions of their job; employees with disabilities who request or receive reasonable accommodation as required by the Department as the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended by the Americans with Disabilities Amendment Act of 2008 (ADAAA); individuals who receive accommodations under the Family Medical Leave Act, and individuals who request or receive accommodations under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Another purpose of this system is to track and report the processing of USDA-wide requests for reasonable accommodation while ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including confidentiality requirements protecting information individuals submit in support of accommodation requests.
