## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing License Amendment No. 5 to Special Nuclear Materials (SNM) License No. SNM-2514 for the Humboldt Bay Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI), located in Humboldt County, California, and is granting an exemption that would relieve Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E, the licensee) from the requirement to submit annual effluent monitoring reports for the Humboldt Bay ISFSI. The requested amendment proposes to delete and make administrative changes to certain license conditions, revise certain technical specifications that are no longer applicable to the Humboldt Bay ISFSI, and add a new administrative technical specification concerning the processing of administrative changes to Humboldt Bay ISFSI's quality assurance program. The amendment also removes license condition 18, which requires the licensee to update its final safety analysis report within 90 days of the NRC issuing a renewed license.
