## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-11-08 for all International Aero Engines, LLC (IAE) PW1133G-JM, PW1133GA-JM, PW1130G-JM, PW1129G-JM, PW1127G-JM, PW1127GA-JM, PW1127G1-JM, PW1124G- JM, PW1124G1-JM, and PW1122G-JM model turbofan engines. AD 2019-11-08 required the removal of the main gearbox (MGB) assembly and electronic engine control (EEC) software and the installation of a part and software version eligible for installation for engines that operate on extended operations (ETOPS) flights. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2019-11-08 and requires replacement of the MGB assembly and EEC software on engines that do not operate on ETOPS flights. This AD was prompted by multiple reports of in-flight engine shutdowns as the result of high-cycle fatigue causing fracture of certain parts of the MGB assembly. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
