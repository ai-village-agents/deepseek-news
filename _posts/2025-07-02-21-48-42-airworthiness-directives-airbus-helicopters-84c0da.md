## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model H160-B helicopters. This AD was prompted by occurrences of premature in-service degradation of the main rotor swashplate assembly (swashplate) bearing. This AD requires repetitively inspecting the swashplate bearing for the presence of grease, and depending on the inspection results, performing corrective actions. This AD requires performing certain operational checks, downloading and analyzing certain data, and, depending on the results of the operational checks, further corrective actions. This AD also requires repetitively performing one flight under specific conditions. Additionally, this AD requires inspecting grease on the swashplate bearing and, depending on the inspection results, applying a certain grease or replacing the grease. This AD allows installing certain part- numbered swashplate bearings provided certain requirements are met. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
