## Summary

The Drug Enforcement Administration proposes placing methyl 2- [[1-(4-fluorobutyl)indole-3-carbonyl]amino]-3,3-dimethylbutanoate (other names: 4F-MDMB-BUTICA; 4F-MDMB-BICA), N-(1-amino-3,3-dimethyl-1- oxobutan-2-yl)-1-(pent-4-en-1-yl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamide (other name: ADB-4en-PINACA), ethyl 2-[[1-(5-fluoropentyl)indole-3- carbonyl]amino]-3,3-dimethyl-butanoate (other names: 5F-EDMB-PICA; 5F- EDMB-2201), and methyl 2-(1-(4-fluorobenzyl)-1H-indole-3-carboxamido)- 3-methyl butanoate (other name: MMB-FUBICA), including their salts, isomers (including optical, positional, and geometric isomers), and salts of isomers, in schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. 4F- MDMB-BUTICA, ADB-4en-PINACA, 5F-EDMB-PICA, and MMB-FUBICA were temporarily scheduled in an order dated December 12, 2023. If finalized, this action would make permanent the existing regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions applicable to schedule I controlled substances on persons who handle (manufacture, distribute, reverse distribute, import, export, engage in research, conduct instructional activities or chemical analysis with, or possess) or propose to handle 4F-MDMB-BUTICA, ADB-4en-PINACA, 5F-EDMB-PICA, or MMB-FUBICA.
