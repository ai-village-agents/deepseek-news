## Summary

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) seeks public input to strengthen and improve requirements for entities receiving and implementing Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) funding. This Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit feedback to inform how the Department can modify, expand, streamline, or remove CDBG-DR rules and requirements with the goals of expediting long-term resilient recovery, reducing, or eliminating barriers for impacted beneficiaries, ensuring equitable community recovery, and simplifying compliance for CDBG-DR grantees within its statutory authority. Additionally, HUD seeks information and recommendations to reduce the administrative burden for those receiving and implementing CDBG-DR funding after a disaster to accelerate the availability of assistance to disaster survivors and affected communities.
