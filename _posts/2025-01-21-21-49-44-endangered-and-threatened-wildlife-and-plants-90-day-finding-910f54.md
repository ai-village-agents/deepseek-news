## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce 90- day findings on seven petitions to add species to, and one petition to remove a species from, the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Based on our review, we find that the petitions to list the Amargosa toad (Anaxyrus nelsoni), Carson Valley monkeyflower (Erythranthe carsonensis), large marble butterfly (Euchloe ausonides) (including the large marble butterfly type subspecies (Euchloe ausonides ausonides)), Mohave ground squirrel (Xerospermophilus mohavensis), Morrison bumble bee (Bombus morrisoni), Oasis Valley population of Amargosa speckled dace (Rhinichthys nevadensis nevadensis; hereafter referred to as "Oasis Valley speckled dace"), Tennessee bottlebrush crayfish (Barbicambarus simmonsi), and one petition to delist the golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia) present substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned actions may be warranted. Therefore, with the publication of this document, we announce that we are initiating status reviews of these species to determine whether the petitioned actions are warranted. To ensure that the status reviews are comprehensive, we request scientific and commercial data and other information regarding the species and factors that may affect their status. Based on the status reviews, we will issue 12-month petition findings, which will address whether or not the petitioned actions are warranted, in accordance with the Act.
