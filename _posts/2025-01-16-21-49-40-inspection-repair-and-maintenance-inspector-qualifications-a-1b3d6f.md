## Summary

FMCSA grants a limited 5-year exemption to the American Trucking Associations (ATA) on behalf of motor carriers, intermodal equipment providers (IEPs), and individuals, from the requirements that an individual must complete 1 year of training, experience, or a combination thereof prior to being qualified to conduct annual commercial motor vehicle (CMV) inspections and to conduct brake-related inspection, repair and maintenance tasks on CMVs. The exemption covers individuals who successfully complete a training program that is self- certified by the training provider as consistent with a set of recommended practices (RPs) developed by the ATA's Technology and Maintenance Council (TMC) and motor carriers and IEPs who rely on these training programs and individuals to satisfy FMCSA's rules. The Agency has determined that granting the exemption from the requirements for 1 year of training, experience, or a combination thereof for individuals who successfully complete, and educators who provide, a performance- based inspector training program consistent with the TMC RPs, would likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to or greater than the level of safety provided by the regulatory requirements.
