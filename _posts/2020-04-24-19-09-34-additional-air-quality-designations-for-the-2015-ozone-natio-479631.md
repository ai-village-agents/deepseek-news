## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is providing notice that it has responded to a petition for reconsideration of a rule published in the Federal Register on June 4, 2018 titled, "Additional Air Quality Designations for the 2015 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards," that promulgated initial ozone air quality designations for certain areas in the United States. The August 3, 2018, petition, submitted on behalf of Patel Industrial Park, requested that the EPA reconsider the nonattainment designation for the Uinta Basin, Utah area. The petition also requested that the EPA stay the designation rule as it applies to the Uinta Basin, Utah area, pending reconsideration. The EPA carefully considered the petition and supporting information, along with information contained in the rulemaking docket, in reaching its decision on the petition. The EPA denied the petition for reconsideration in a letter to the petitioner and the letter has been included in the rulemaking docket. The letter explains the EPA's basis for the denial. Because the EPA denied the reconsideration request, the EPA also denied the stay request.
