## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping duty (AD) order on common alloy aluminum sheet (aluminum sheet) from Spain with respect to one exporter/producer of subject merchandise. The period of review (POR) is October 15, 2020, through March 31, 2022. Commerce preliminarily finds that sales of aluminum sheet from Spain were made at less than normal value (NV) during the POR. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.
