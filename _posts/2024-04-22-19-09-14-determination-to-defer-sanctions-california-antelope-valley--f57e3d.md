## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is making an interim final determination that the California Air Resources Board (CARB) has submitted a revised rule on behalf of the Antelope Valley Air Quality Management District (AVAQMD) and Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District (MDAQMD) that corrects deficiencies identified in its Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) state implementation plan (SIP) provisions concerning rules submitted to address section 185 of the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act) with respect to the 1-hour ozone standard. This determination is based on a proposed approval, published elsewhere in this Federal Register, of AVAQMD Rule 315 and MDAQMD Rule 315, which establish a section 185 fee program in the AVAQMD and MDAQMD portions of the Southeast Desert Modified Air Quality Management Area. The effect of this interim final determination is that the imposition of sanctions that were triggered by a previous disapproval by the EPA in 2022 is now deferred. If the EPA finalizes its approval of AVAQMD Rule 315 and MDAQMD Rule 315 submission, relief from these sanctions will become permanent.
