## Summary

The Federal Aviation Administration is requesting public comment on Lancaster Airport Authority's (LAA) request to change 5 acres of airport property from aeronautical use to non-aeronautical use. The parcel was purchased as part of a larger parcel with AIP grants 3-42-0049-022-2002 and 3-42-0049-023-2002. The property was purchased as part of a road relocation for the Runway 8-26 extension project and is located in an area that would be difficult for future aeronautical development. The LAA is requesting approval to release the parcel for permanent non-aeronautical use to erect a vehicle maintenance garage facility. The parcel is identified as 3E on the Airport Layout Plan (ALP). The proposed facility is not currently noted on the ALP, however, if approved, the ALP will be updated to reflect the facility. Documents reflecting the Sponsor's request are available, by appointment only, for inspection at the Airport Manager's office and the FAA Airport District Office.
