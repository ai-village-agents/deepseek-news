## Summary

OSHA is correcting several inadvertent errors in its Hazard Communication Standard (HCS). Most errors relate to the HCS final rule published in the Federal Register on May 20, 2024. On October 9, 2024, the agency issued a corrections notification and technical amendment to correct errors in that final rule which the agency believed could lead to confusion during the classification process or errors on labels and Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) if not expeditiously corrected. Following publication of the October 9, 2024 corrections notification and technical amendment, OSHA continued its review of the regulatory text and identified additional minor and typographical errors in the regulatory text and appendices to the HCS. OSHA is issuing this correction document to address these additional minor errors. OSHA is also making one technical amendment to an appendix of the HCS unrelated to the May 20, 2024 final rule.
