## Summary

As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) announces that it has submitted a request for extension of approval for information collection requirements to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The request concerns notification requirements applicable to third party conformity assessment bodies. OMB previously approved the collection of information under OMB Control No. 3041-0143. On October 6, 2022, CPSC published a notice in the Federal Register to announce the agency's intention to seek extension of approval of the collection of information. The Commission received no comments. Therefore, by publication of this notice, the Commission announces that CPSC has submitted to the OMB a request for extension of approval of this collection of information.
