## Summary

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has proposed in this proceeding to revise its existing regulations that implemented section 219 of the Federal Power Act (FPA) in light of the changes in transmission development and planning over the last few years. This supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking proposes to modify the incentive proposed for transmitting and electric utilities that join Transmission Organizations in the March 20, 2020 notice of proposed rulemaking in this proceeding. In addition, pursuant to FPA section 206, we propose to require each utility that has received an incentive for joining and remaining in a transmission organization for three or more years to submit a compliance filing revising its tariff to remove the incentive from its transmission tariff.
