## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model EC 130 B4 and EC 130 T2 helicopters. This AD was prompted by the determination that fatigue cracks may develop at the root section of certain tail rotor blades (TRBs). This AD requires inspecting those TRBs and, depending on the results, replacing the TRB with a serviceable TRB. This AD also prohibits installing those TRBs unless certain actions are accomplished. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
