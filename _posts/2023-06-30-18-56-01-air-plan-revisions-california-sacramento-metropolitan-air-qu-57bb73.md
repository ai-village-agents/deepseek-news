## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to partially approve and partially disapprove a revision to the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD) portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). The revision concerns the SMAQMD's demonstration regarding reasonably available control technology (RACT) requirements and negative declarations for the 2008 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS or "standards") in the portion of the Sacramento Metropolitan nonattainment area under the jurisdiction of the SMAQMD. We are also correcting sections in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) to reflect the current status of certain provisions of the SMAQMD portions of the California SIP related to the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS.
