## Summary

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency of the United States Department of Commerce, in support of efforts to establish the measurement science required for development of the standards and industry for Additive Construction by Extrusion (ACE), is establishing the Additive Construction by Extrusion (ACE) Consortium ("Consortium"). The Consortium will bring together stakeholders to identify and address gaps in current standards related to materials, methods, structural performance, and engineering design. The Consortium efforts are intended to study the measurement science needs for the successful adoption of ACE by the construction industry, and to identify and propose new standards to address industry needs not met by existing standards. Participation fees will be at least $10,000 annually or in-kind contributions of equivalent value. Participants will be required to sign a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA). At NIST's discretion, entities which are not permitted to enter into CRADAs pursuant to law or other governmental constraint may be allowed to participate in the Consortium pursuant to a separate non-CRADA agreement.
