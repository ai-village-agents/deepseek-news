## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for all navigable waters within a 4,000-yard oval radius off the Stan Sayres Memorial Hydroplane Pits downward to the Adams Street Boat Ramp on Lake Washington. The safety zone is needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards in the vicinity of the Stan Sayres Memorial Park and Boat Launch and Adams Street Boat Ramp associated with test trials of a hydroplane race boat. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port Sector Puget Sound or a designated representative.
