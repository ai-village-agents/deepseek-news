## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to affirm the listing of the streaked horned lark (Eremophila alpestris strigata), a bird species from Washington and Oregon, as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). After a review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we again conclude that listing the species as threatened is warranted. We also propose to revise the rule issued under section 4(d) of the Act ("4(d) rule") for this bird. If we finalize this rule as proposed, it will maintain this species as a threatened species on the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and continue to extend the Act's protections to the species.
