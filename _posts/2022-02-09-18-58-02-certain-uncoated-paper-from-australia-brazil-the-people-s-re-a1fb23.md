## Summary

As a result of the determinations by the Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the International Trade Commission (ITC) that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) orders on certain uncoated paper (uncoated paper) from Australia, Brazil, the People's Republic of China (China), Indonesia, and Portugal, and the countervailing duty (CVD) orders on uncoated paper from China and Indonesia, would likely lead to a continuation or recurrence of dumping, net countervailable subsidies, and material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation of these AD and CVD orders.
