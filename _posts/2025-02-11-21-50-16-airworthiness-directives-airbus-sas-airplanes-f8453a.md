## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, -232, -251N, -252N, -253N, -271N, -272N, -251NX, -252NX, -253NX, - 271NX, and -272NX airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by the identification of an erroneous value of the main landing gear (MLG) tire width in the aircraft data files used for aircraft performance computation. This proposed AD would require revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to incorporate a complementary performance data file (CPDF) update as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
