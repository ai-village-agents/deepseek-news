## Summary

This proposed rule would amend the regulations for certain HUD Public and Indian Housing and Housing Programs. The proposed amendments would revise existing regulations that govern admission for applicants with criminal records or a history of involvement with the criminal justice system and eviction or termination of assistance of persons on the basis of illegal drug use, drug-related criminal activity, or other criminal activity. The proposed revisions would require that prior to any discretionary denial or termination for criminal activity, PHAs and assisted housing owners take into consideration multiple sources of information, including but not limited to the recency and relevance of prior criminal activity. They are intended to minimize unnecessary exclusions from these programs while allowing providers to maintain the health, safety, and peaceful enjoyment of their residents, their staffs, and their communities. The proposed rule is intended to both clarify existing PHA and owner obligations and reduce the risk of violation of nondiscrimination laws.
