## Summary

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposes to rule and invites public comment for the release of approximately 8 acres of airport land, at Tucson International Airport (TUS), Tucson, Pima County, Arizona from the aeronautical use provisions of the Grant Agreement Assurances since the land is not needed for airport purposes. The land for proposed release consists of one parcel and two partial parcels located south of East Valencia Road, east of South Park Avenue, and located in the northwest section of the TUS airport. The land will be sold to the Arizona Air National Guard, to accommodate the future reconfiguration of their entry control facility. The airport will be compensated for the fair market value of the land. The use of the land for an entry control facility represents a compatible land use that will not interfere with the airport or its operation, thereby protecting the interests of civil aviation.
