## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve, through parallel processing, revisions to the Missouri State Implementation Plan (SIP) relating to the St. Louis area's vehicle Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) Program received on November 12, 2019, and March 2, 2022. In the submissions, Missouri requests EPA approval of revisions to a regulation and related plan that implement the St. Louis area's Inspection and Maintenance program called, Gateway Vehicle Inspection Program (GVIP). We propose to approve Missouri's removal of vehicles registered in Franklin County, unless the vehicle is primarily operated in the rest of the area, from the Gateway Vehicle Inspection program. The revisions to this rule include amending the rule exemption section for vehicles subject to the rule, removing unnecessary words, amending definitions specific to the rule, updates due to technology changes, and other minor edits. These revisions do not impact the attainment of any National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) nor delay the timely attainment of 2015 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard. Approval of these revisions will ensure consistency between state and federally approved rules.
