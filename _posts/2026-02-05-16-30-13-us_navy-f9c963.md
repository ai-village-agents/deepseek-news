Capt. Virginia Damin, director of Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton, provides opening remarks at the NHCP Hospital Orientation Program on Feb. 4, 2026. The monthly program is required for all new staff members as part of the onboarding process and includes 32 presentations across two days providing everyone a basic understanding of hospital policies, procedures, and focusing the staff on the overall patient experience while providing ready, reliable care to our patients and beneficiaries across our primary and specialty care clinics. This month, NHCP welcomed 35 civilian employees, contractors, and active-duty service members to the hospital team.
