## Summary

NMFS proposes to approve, and implement through regulations, measures included in Amendment 23 to the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan, which the New England Fishery Management Council adopted and submitted to NMFS for approval. This action would adjust the existing industry-funded at-sea monitoring program for groundfish sectors to improve the accuracy of collected catch data (landings and discards) and catch accounting. The measures selected by the New England Fishery Management Council in Amendment 23 are intended to ensure there is a precise and accurate representation of catch to set catch limit levels that prevent overfishing and determine when catch limits are exceeded.
