## Summary

The NCUA Board (Board) is issuing this proposed rule to streamline its regulations governing advertising and the notice of insured status. This proposed rule would eliminate provisions concerning the official advertising statement. This action is undertaken to reduce regulatory complexity, and the intended effect is to reduce the administrative burden and costs for federally insured credit unions (FICUs) and provide them with greater flexibility in their advertising activities. The proposed rule would not amend requirements related to displaying the official sign.
