## Summary

The Chief of the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) may approve modifications to a specific Laboratory Accreditation Program (LAP) when a request to modify the LAP is received. Modifications may include addition of tests, types of tests or standards that are directly relevant to the LAP. NVLAP has received a request to revise the name of its Personal Body Armor LAP to the Law Enforcement and Corrections Equipment LAP in order to better encompass the scope of this program. NVLAP has also received a request to expand the technology tested under this program to include rifle testing, helmet testing and shield testing. NIST seeks feedback from the public on these proposed revisions.
