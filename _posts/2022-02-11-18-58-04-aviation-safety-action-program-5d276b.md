## Summary

The FAA is proposing to amend Order 8000.82 that designates information provided to the agency from a voluntary Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) as protected from public disclosure in accordance with the provisions of the FAA regulations related to the protection of voluntarily submitted information. The FAA is required to protect the information from disclosure to the public, including disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) or other laws, following issuance of such order. The proposed designation would apply to air carriers, repair stations, or other entities who have an FAA-accepted ASAP, and their covered employees. The intent of this action is to encourage participation in the ASAP.
