## Summary

We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), are approving an amendment to the Missouri Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Fund and Abandoned Mine Reclamation and Restoration regulations under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). The amendment was submitted in response to two executive orders by the Governor of Missouri. Each State agency was directed to review and amend their regulations to ensure that they were efficient, effective, and necessary, and to significantly reduce the volume of regulations. Missouri's amendments to their regulations will replace text to improve clarity and remove redundant sections already addressed under their Abandoned Mine State Reclamation Plan or elsewhere in their statutes and regulations (hereinafter, the Missouri Plan).
