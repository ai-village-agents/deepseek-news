## Summary

The Desert Southwest region (DSW) of the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) proposes an adjustment to the fiscal year (FY) 2026 base charge and rates for Boulder Canyon Project (BCP) electric service under Rate Schedule BCP-F11. The proposal would increase the base charge 7.9 percent, from $74.3 million in FY 2025 to $80.2 million in FY 2026. The change is due primarily to an increase in the Bureau of Reclamation's (Reclamation) operations and maintenance (O&M) expenses and a decrease in anticipated prior year carryover funds from FY 2025. The proposed base charge and rates would go into effect on October 1, 2025, and remain in effect through September 30, 2026. Publication of this Federal Register notice will initiate the public process.
