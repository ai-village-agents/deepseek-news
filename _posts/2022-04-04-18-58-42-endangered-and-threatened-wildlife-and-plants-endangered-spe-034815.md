## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are reopening the public comment period on our August 25, 2021, proposed rule to list the Amur sturgeon (Acipenser schrenckii), a fish species from the Amur River basin in Russia and China, as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). We are taking this action to conduct a public hearing on the petition to list the Amur sturgeon. Comments previously submitted need not be resubmitted and will be fully considered in preparation of the final rule.
