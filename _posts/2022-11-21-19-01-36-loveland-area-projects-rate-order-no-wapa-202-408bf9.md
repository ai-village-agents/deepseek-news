LAP consists of the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project (Fry-Ark) and the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program (P-SMBP)--Western Division, which were integrated for marketing and rate-making purposes in 1989. These new formula rates replace the existing formula rates for these services under Rate Schedules L-F11, Firm Electric Service, and L-M2, Sale of Surplus Products, which expire on December 31, 2022. The LAP firm electric service rate is increasing 16.5 percent. There are no changes to the formula rate for sale of surplus products.
