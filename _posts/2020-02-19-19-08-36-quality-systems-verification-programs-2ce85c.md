## Summary

The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) proposes to amend regulations on Quality Systems Verification Programs (QSVP) to clarify that all voluntary, user-fee services under this part are applicable to all commodities covered by the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (Act), as amended. Further, AMS proposes to broaden the scope of services to include all current and future AMS voluntary, user-fee audit verification and accreditation programs and services. AMS will also harmonize administrative procedures governing these services and make conforming changes as necessary in other parts of our regulations.
