## Summary

On March 15, 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau or CFPB) issued a request for information seeking input from the public related to data brokers. The request for information was published in the Federal Register on March 21, 2023, and provided for a comment period that was set to expire on June 13, 2023. To allow interested persons more time to gather the requested information and submit comments, the CFPB has determined that an extension of the comment period until July 15, 2023, is appropriate.
