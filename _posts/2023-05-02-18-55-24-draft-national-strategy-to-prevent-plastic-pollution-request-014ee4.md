## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed the Draft National Strategy to Prevent Plastic Pollution to reduce plastic waste and other post-consumer materials in waterways and oceans, as directed by Congress in section 301 of the Save Our Seas 2.0 Act. This Notice provides the public with an opportunity to share information and provide feedback on the draft strategy, which identifies actions where EPA can work collaboratively with stakeholders to prevent plastic pollution and reduce, reuse, collect, and capture plastic and other waste from land-based sources. EPA is seeking public comment from a broad array of stakeholders engaged in post-consumer materials management and infrastructure, including, but not limited to: state, tribal, territorial, and local governments; industry; researchers; academia; non-profit organizations; community groups; and international organizations. Public comments received will inform the Agency's efforts to finalize and implement the strategy and further work with stakeholders to implement the actions.
