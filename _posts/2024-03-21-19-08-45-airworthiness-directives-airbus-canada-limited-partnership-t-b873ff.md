## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD- 500-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by production flight test findings of several oxygen masks disconnected from their accompanying portable oxygen bottles. This proposed AD would require inspecting the portable oxygen bottles and reconnecting the masks to the accompanying portable oxygen bottles if not connected, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
