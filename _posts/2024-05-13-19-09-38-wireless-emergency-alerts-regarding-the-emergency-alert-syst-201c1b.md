## Summary

In this document, the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau (Bureau) seeks comment on specific mechanisms to implement multilingual Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA), as directed by the Federal Communications Commission. The Bureau proposes to require commercial mobile service providers participating in WEA (Participating CMS Providers) to support a set of pre-translated WEA messages in English, the 13 most commonly spoken languages in the United States, and American Sign Language (ASL), that would be pre-installed and stored on mobile devices. These messages--called templates--would be displayed at the option of the alert originator. The Bureau also seeks comment on support for form-fillable templates that would include information specific to the particular emergency. Finally, the Bureau seeks comment on whether Participating CMS Providers' device offerings should support templates in additional languages.
