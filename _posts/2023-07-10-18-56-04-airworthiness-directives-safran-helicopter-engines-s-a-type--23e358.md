## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-01- 12, which applied to all Safran Helicopter Engines, S.A. (Safran) Model Arriel 1C, Arriel 1C1, and Arriel 1C2 engines. AD 2023-01-12 required replacing affected fire detectors and prohibited installation of affected fire detectors. Since the FAA issued AD 2023-01-12, the FAA has determined that Model Arriel 1K1 engines are also affected by the unsafe condition. This AD is prompted by reports of false engine fire warnings. This AD requires replacing the affected fire detectors, prohibits installation of affected fire detectors, and adds Model Arriel 1K1 engines to the applicability, as specified in an European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference (IBR). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
