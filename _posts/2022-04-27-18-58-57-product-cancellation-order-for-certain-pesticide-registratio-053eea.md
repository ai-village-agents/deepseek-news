## Summary

This notice announces EPA's order for the cancellations, voluntarily requested by the registrant and accepted by the Agency, of the products listed in Table 1 of Unit II, pursuant to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). This cancellation order follows a February 24, 2022, Federal Register Notice of Receipt of Requests from the registrant listed in Table 2 of Unit II to voluntarily cancel these product registrations. In the February 24, 2022, notice, EPA indicated that it would issue an order implementing the cancellations, unless the Agency received substantive comments within the 30-day comment period that would merit its further review of these requests, or unless the registrant withdrew their request. The Agency received three incomplete anonymous public comments on the notice, but none merited its further review of the requests. Further, the registrant did not withdraw their requests. Accordingly, EPA hereby issues in this notice a cancellation order granting the requested cancellations. Any distribution, sale, or use of the products subject to this cancellation order is permitted only in accordance with the terms of this order, including any existing stocks provisions.
