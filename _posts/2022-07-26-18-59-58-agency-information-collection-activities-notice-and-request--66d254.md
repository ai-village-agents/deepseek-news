## Summary

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. Before a Federal agency can collect certain information from the public, it must receive approval from OMB. Under procedures established by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, before seeking OMB approval, Federal agencies must solicit public comment on proposed collections of information, including extensions and reinstatement of previously approved collections. This document describes a collection of labeling information on seven Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) for which NHTSA intends to seek OMB approval. The labeling requirements include brake fluid warning, glazing labeling, air bag warning labels, seat belt labeling, compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicle fuel label, and CNG fuel container labels.
