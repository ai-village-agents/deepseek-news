## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-11- 01, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A300 series airplanes; Model A300 B4-600, B4-600R, and F4-600R series airplanes; and Model A300 C4-605R Variant F airplanes (collectively called Model A300-600 series airplanes). AD 2022-11-01 required a detailed inspection (DET) of the main landing gear (MLG) support rib 5 lower flange, a fluorescent penetrant inspection (FPI) around the spot facing of certain fastener holes if necessary, and applicable corrective actions. This AD was prompted by the determination that additional airplanes are affected by the unsafe condition. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2022-11-01 and adds airplanes to the applicability, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
