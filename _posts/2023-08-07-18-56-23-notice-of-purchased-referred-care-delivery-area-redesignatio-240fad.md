## Summary

This Notice advises the public that the Indian Health Service (IHS) proposes to expand the geographic boundaries of the Purchased/ Referred Care Delivery Area (PRCDA) for the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde (CTGR) in the State of Oregon to include the county of Clackamas in the State of Oregon. The current PRCDA for the CTGR includes the Oregon counties of Washington, Polk, Yamhill, Marion, Multnomah, and Tillamook. The CTGR members residing outside of the PRCDA are eligible for direct care services, however, they are not eligible for Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) services. The sole purpose of this expansion would be to authorize additional CTGR members and beneficiaries to receive PRC services.
