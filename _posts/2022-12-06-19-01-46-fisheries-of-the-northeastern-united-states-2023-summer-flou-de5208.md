## Summary

NMFS proposes 2023 specifications for the summer flounder, scup, and black sea fisheries. The implementing regulations for the Summer Flounder, Scup, and Black Sea Bass Fishery Management Plan require us to publish specifications for the upcoming fishing year for each of these species and to provide an opportunity for public comment. The proposed specifications are intended to establish allowable harvest levels for these species that will prevent overfishing, consistent with the most recent scientific information. This rule also proposes to make a change to the regulations to facilitate states' participation in a Wave 1 (January-February) recreational black sea bass fishery.
