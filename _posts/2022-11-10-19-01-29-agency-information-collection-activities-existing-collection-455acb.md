## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC or Commission) announces that it intends to submit to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request for a three-year PRA approval of revisions to the currently approved Component 1 of the Employer Information Report (EEO-1).\1\ This PRA submission for the EEO-1 Component 1 does not change the types of demographic workforce data historically collected by the EEO-1 (i.e., employee data by job category and sex and race or ethnicity). Rather, as part of this routine three-year clearance for Component 1 under the PRA, the EEOC seeks OMB approval of measures that streamline and modernize how the current EEO-1 Component 1 workforce demographic data are collected from employers. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
