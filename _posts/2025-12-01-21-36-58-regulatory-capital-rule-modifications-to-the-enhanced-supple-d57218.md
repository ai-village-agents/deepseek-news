## Summary

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) are adopting a final rule to modify the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standards applicable to U.S. bank holding companies identified as global systemically important bank holding companies (GSIBs), their subsidiary depository institutions that are Board- or FDIC-regulated, and national banks and Federal savings associations that are subsidiaries of a U.S. top-tier bank holding company with total consolidated assets of more than $700 billion or assets under custody of more than $10 trillion (together with Board- and FDIC-regulated subsidiary depository institutions of GSIBs, covered depository institutions). These modifications are intended to help ensure that the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standards serve as a backstop to risk-based capital requirements rather than a frequently binding constraint, thus reducing potential disincentives for GSIBs and covered depository institutions to participate in low-risk, low-return activities. The Board is also finalizing conforming amendments to its total loss-absorbing capacity and long-term debt requirements. In addition, the Board is making conforming amendments to relevant regulatory reporting forms, and the Board and FDIC are making final certain technical corrections to the capital rule and the prompt corrective action framework. Banking organizations subject to the final rule may elect to early adopt the final rule as of January 1, 2026.
