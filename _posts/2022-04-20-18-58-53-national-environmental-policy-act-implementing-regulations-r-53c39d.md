## Summary

The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) issues this final rule to amend certain provisions of its regulations for implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), addressing the purpose and need of a proposed action, agency NEPA procedures for implementing CEQ's NEPA regulations, and the definition of "effects." The amendments generally restore provisions that were in effect for decades before being modified in 2020.
