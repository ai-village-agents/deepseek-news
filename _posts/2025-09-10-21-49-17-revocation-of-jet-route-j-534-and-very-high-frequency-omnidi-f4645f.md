## Summary

This action revokes Jet Route J-534 and Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal Airway V-349, amends VOR Federal Airways V-23 and V-165, and establishes Canadian Area Navigation (RNAV) Route T-645 in the Northwestern United States. The FAA is taking this action due to the pending decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Whatcom (HUH), WA, VOR/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) navigational aid (NAVAID). The VOR portion of the Whatcom VORTAC is being decommissioned in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program. There are two airways that use the naming convention of V-23. One is located in the state of Hawaii, and the other is located in the state of California. This action affects the V-23 in the state of California and does not make any changes to the V-23 in the state of Hawaii.
