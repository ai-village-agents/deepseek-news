## Summary

The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC" or "Commission") recently published a notice of proposed rulemaking ("NPRM") in the Federal Register, titled "Rule on Unfair or Deceptive Fees," which would prohibit unfair or deceptive practices relating to fees for goods or services, specifically, misrepresenting the total costs of goods and services by omitting mandatory fees from advertised prices and misrepresenting the nature and purpose of fees. The NPRM announced the opportunity for interested parties to present their positions orally at an informal hearing. Seventeen commenters requested to participate at the informal hearing. The Commission's Chief Presiding Officer, the Chair, has appointed an Administrative Law Judge for the Federal Trade Commission, the Honorable Jay L. Himes to serve as the presiding officer of the informal hearing.
