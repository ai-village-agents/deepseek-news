## Summary

The Department of Commerce (Commerce) is self-initiating a scope inquiry, pursuant to U.S. trade remedy laws, to determine whether imports of quartz surface products (QSP), completed in Malaysia using inputs manufactured in the People's Republic of China (China), are covered by the antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on QSP from China (collectively, the Orders).
