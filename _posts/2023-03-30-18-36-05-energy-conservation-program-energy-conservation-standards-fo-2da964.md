## Summary

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended (EPCA), prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment, including small, large, and very large commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment, of which variable refrigerant flow (VRF) multi-split air conditioners and VRF multi-split system heat pumps (collectively referred to as "VRF multi-split systems") are a category. EPCA requires the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE or the Department) to consider the need for amended standards each time American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 90.1 is amended with respect to the standard levels or design requirements applicable to that equipment, or periodically under a six- year-lookback review provision. In this final rule, DOE is adopting amended energy conservation standards for VRF multi-split systems that rely on a new cooling efficiency metric and are equivalent to those levels specified in ASHRAE Standard 90.1. DOE has determined that it lacks the clear and convincing evidence required by the statute to adopt standards more stringent than the levels specified in the industry standard.
