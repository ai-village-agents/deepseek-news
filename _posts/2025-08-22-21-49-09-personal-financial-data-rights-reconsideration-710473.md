## Summary

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB or Bureau) is seeking comments and data to inform its consideration of four issues related to implementation of section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). These issues are: the proper understanding of who can serve as a "representative" making a request on behalf of the consumer; the optimal approach to the assessment of fees to defray the costs incurred by a "covered person" in responding to a customer driven request; the threat and cost-benefit pictures for data security associated with section 1033 compliance; and the threat picture for data privacy associated with section 1033 compliance.
