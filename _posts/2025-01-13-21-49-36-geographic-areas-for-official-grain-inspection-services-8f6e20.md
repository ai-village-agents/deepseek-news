## Summary

The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is issuing this notice to announce proposed updates to the boundaries of the geographic areas in which official service providers (OSP) perform official inspection and weighing services under a United States Grain Standards Act (USGSA) designation or delegation, and for purposes of cooperative service agreements under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (AMA). The proposed updates are necessary due to changes in natural and man- made landmarks, railroad lines, roads, and signs that were used in historical boundary descriptions.
