## Summary

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has developed draft agency guidance, entitled Engineer Circular 1165-2-218, to consolidate and formalize policies and procedures for its Levee Safety Program. The intent of the Levee Safety Program is to understand, monitor, and manage flood risk associated with levees over time, provide a framework to sustain long term benefits, and adapt activities and actions based on the dynamic nature of flood risk. USACE is seeking feedback from non-federal levee sponsors, interested associations, Tribes, other federal agencies, and any other interested individuals on this proposed draft guidance document. This notice announces the availability of the draft Engineer Circular for comment. The comment period on the draft document starts with the publication of this notice in the Federal Register and will last for 60 days. The draft Engineer Circular is available for review on the USACE Levee Safety Program website (https:/ /www.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Levee-Safety-Program/) and at (http://www.regulations.gov) reference docket number COE-2020-0003.
