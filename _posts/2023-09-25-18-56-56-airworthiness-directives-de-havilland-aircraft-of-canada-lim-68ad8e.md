## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited Model DHC-8-401 and -402 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of moisture in the wing-to-fuselage joint, between the mating front spar and rear spar frame segments. This proposed AD would require a visual inspection of the fuselage front and rear spar frames, an ultrasonic test if applicable, other specified actions, and repair if necessary. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
