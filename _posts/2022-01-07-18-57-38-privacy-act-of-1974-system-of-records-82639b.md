## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA), Office of Land and Emergency Management (OLEM) is giving notice that it proposes to modify a system of records pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. Environmental Assessments of Residential Properties (EARP) is being modified to further clarify the nature of the information, and the ways in which that information may be used and shared with parties who are part of the evaluation and coordination process. This system of records contains information of individuals that is collected in the course of response and environmental assessment actions, including actions taken under a variety of EPA authorities. The information maintained under this System of Records Notice (SORN) is needed to support EPA's decision-making process on what actions may be necessary to address potential environmental impacts at residential properties, including necessary investigation and cleanup activities. This information is collected to ensure an appropriate and cohesive response to situations that may require EPA response activities, and to protect the health and welfare of residents who may be affected by conditions that present a potential environmental or public health threat. The information is maintained as needed for consideration and coordination of environmental response activities. This information may include individuals' contact information, information related to their address or place of residence, correspondence, and related environmental and public health information collected in the course of investigation, sampling, and cleanup work, as described in further detail below. All exemptions and provisions included in the previously published SORN for EARP will transfer to the modified SORN for EARP.
