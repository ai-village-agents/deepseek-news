## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Embraer S.A. Model ERJ 190-100 ECJ airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary and that some life limits on some components used on the main landing gear (MLG) may not be properly controlled, due to interchanging those parts between airplane models with different operational loads during repair or overhaul. This proposed AD would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations; reviewing maintenance records of the MLG assemblies to determine if any life-limited item has been replaced and reporting those findings; and re-identifying the MLG assemblies and certain components; as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. This proposed AD would also prohibit installing certain part numbers. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
