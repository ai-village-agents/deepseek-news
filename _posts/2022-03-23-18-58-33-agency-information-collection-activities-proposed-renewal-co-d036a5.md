## Summary

As part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, FinCEN invites comments on the proposed renewal, without change, of a currently approved information collection found in existing Bank Secrecy Act regulations. Specifically, FinCEN invites comments on a renewal, without change, of existing information collection requirements for the Report of International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments (CMIR). Although no changes are proposed to the information collection itself, this request for comments covers a proposed updated burden estimate for the information collection. This request for comments is made pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA).
