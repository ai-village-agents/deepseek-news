## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a safety zone around the Heidelberg Spar, located in Green Canyon Block 860 on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) in the Gulf of Mexico. Establishing a safety zone around the facility will significantly reduce the threat of allisions, collisions, security breaches, oil spills, releases of natural gas, and thereby protect the safety of life, property, and the environment. Only vessels measuring less than 100 feet in length overall and not engaged in towing, attending vessels, or those vessels specifically authorized by the Eighth Coast Guard District Commander or a designated representative are permitted to enter or remain in the safety zone. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
