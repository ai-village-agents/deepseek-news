## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve the request by the State of Utah to redesignate the Logan, Utah-Idaho (UT-ID) nonattainment area (NAA) ("Logan NAA") to attainment status for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 2.5 microns (PM<INF>2.5</INF>), and to approve related State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of Utah on November 5, 2019, and January 13, 2020. The redesignation request documents that the area has attained the 2006 PM<INF>2.5</INF> National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and provides supporting information. The November 5, 2019 submittal includes revisions to Utah's R307-110-31 and R307-110-36 rules, concerning SIP Sections X.A and X.F. The January 13, 2020 submittal includes revisions to UAC R307-110-10 and the maintenance plan for the Logan NAA, which demonstrates attainment through the year 2035. The EPA is taking this action pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act). A separate EPA redesignation rulemaking will be conducted for the Idaho portion of the Logan NAA.
