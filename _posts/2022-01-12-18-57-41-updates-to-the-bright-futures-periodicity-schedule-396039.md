## Summary

Effective December 30, 2021, HRSA accepted recommended updates to the Bright Futures Periodicity Schedule, a HRSA-supported guideline for infants, children and adolescents for purposes of ensuring that non-grandfathered group and individual health insurance issuers provide coverage without cost sharing under the Public Health Service Act. The updates to the Bright Futures Periodicity Schedule are: A new category for sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death risk assessment, a new category for hepatitis B virus infection risk assessment, addition of suicide risk as an element of universal depression screening for children ages 12-21, and updated category title from "Psychosocial/ Behavioral Assessment" to "Behavioral/Social/Emotional Screening," with no revision to the ages in which the screening occurs (newborn to 21 years). Finally, two clarifying references related to dental fluoride varnish and fluoride supplementation have been added, with no associated recommended changes to clinical practice or health insurance coverage.
