## Summary

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) intends to prepare a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) to address the potential environmental effects associated with the construction, operation, and decommissioning of an advanced nuclear reactor technology park at the Clinch River Nuclear (CRN) Site in Oak Ridge, Roane County, Tennessee. The park would contain one or more advanced nuclear reactors with a cumulative electrical output not to exceed 800 megawatts electric (MWe). TVA plans to evaluate a variety of alternatives including a no-action alternative. Public comments are invited to identify other potential alternatives, information, and analysis relevant to the proposed action.
