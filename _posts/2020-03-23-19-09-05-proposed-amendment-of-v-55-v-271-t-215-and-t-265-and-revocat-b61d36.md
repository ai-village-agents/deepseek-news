## Summary

This action proposes to amend two VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways, V-55 and V-271; amend two low altitude Area Navigation (RNAV) routes, T-215 and T-265; and remove two VOR Federal airways, V-215 and V-450, in the vicinity of Muskegon, MI. The air traffic service (ATS) route modifications are necessary due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Muskegon, MI, VOR/ Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) navigation aid (NAVAID). The NAVAID provides navigation guidance for portions of the affected ATS routes. This VOR is being decommissioned as part of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
