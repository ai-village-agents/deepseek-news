## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") and the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") (collectively, "we" or "Commissions") are adopting amendments to Form PF, the confidential reporting form for certain SEC-registered investment advisers to private funds, including those that also are registered with the CFTC as a commodity pool operator ("CPO") or commodity trading adviser ("CTA"). The amendments are designed to enhance the Financial Stability Oversight Council's ("FSOC's") ability to monitor systemic risk as well as bolster the SEC's regulatory oversight of private fund advisers and investor protection efforts. In connection with the amendments to Form PF, the SEC is amending a rule under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Advisers Act") to revise instructions for requesting a temporary hardship exemption.
