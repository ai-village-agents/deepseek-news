## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), list the Puerto Rican harlequin butterfly (Atlantea tulita), a species from Puerto Rico, as a threatened species with a rule issued under section 4(d) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. We also designate critical habitat for this species under the Act. In total, approximately 41,266 acres (16,699.8 hectares) in six units in the municipalities of Isabela, Quebradillas, Camuy, Arecibo, Utuado, Florida, Ciales, Maricao, San Germ[aacute]n, Sabana Grande, and Yauco are within the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. This rule extends the Act's protections to the species and its designated critical habitat.
