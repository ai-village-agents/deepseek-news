## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce the availability of documents related to an application for an incidental take permit (ITP) under the Endangered Species Act. The Nebraska Public Power District (NPPD) is applying for a permit associated with incidental take of the American burying beetle (Nicrophorus americanus; ABB) during construction, operation, and maintenance of a new transmission line in central Nebraska (known as the R-Project). NPPD has submitted a new application for a 50-year ITP, including a revised proposed habitat conservation plan (revised HCP) and associated documents. We previously issued an ITP for the R-Project and the applicant's earlier HCP to NPPD in 2019. However, that ITP was remanded by a Court. In response to the Court remand, NPPD has prepared the revised HCP as part of the new ITP application. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act, we now announce the availability of the draft supplemental EIS (draft SEIS) associated with the revised HCP. We invite comment from the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies.
