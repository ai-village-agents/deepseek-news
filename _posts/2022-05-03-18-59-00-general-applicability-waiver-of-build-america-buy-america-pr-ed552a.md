## Summary

In accordance with the Build America, Buy America Act (the Act) this notice advises that HUD is proposing a general applicability waiver for six months to the Buy America Domestic Content Procurement Preference ("Buy America Preference," or "BAP") to provide the agency with sufficient time to solicit information from the public relating to the agency's potential information collection needs and the associated burdens that would be placed on recipients arising from compliance and monitoring with the BAP in connection with Federal Financial Assistance awards made by HUD. In accordance with the Act, HUD has found that this proposed general applicability waiver is in the public interest as HUD must complete the required public comment process pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act to establish an approved collection for the information identified as necessary to establish compliance with the BAP.
