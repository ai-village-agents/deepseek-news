## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") is providing notice of disclosure relating to the criminal prosecution styled United States v. Emanuele Palma, Case No. 2:19-cr-20626-NGE-DRG (E.D. Mich.) (the "Palma Prosecution"). In response to a court order in the Palma Prosecution, EPA is disclosing documents to the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") for production in the litigation which may contain information submitted to EPA by vehicle and engine manufacturers that is claimed to be, or has been determined to be, potential confidential business information (collectively "CBI"). The use of the documents and any potential CBI is limited to the Palma Prosecution and its distribution is restricted by the terms of a court issued protective order.
