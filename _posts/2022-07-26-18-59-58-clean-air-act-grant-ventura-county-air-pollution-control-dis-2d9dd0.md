## Summary

The EPA is proposing to determine that the reduction in expenditures of recurrent non-Federal funds for the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District ("VCAPCD" or "District") in support of its continuing air program under section 105 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) for the calendar year 2021 are a result of non-selective reductions in expenditures. This determination, when final, will permit the VCAPCD to receive grant funding for fiscal year (FY) 2022 from the EPA under section 105 of the CAA.
