## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing Revision 1 to Regulatory Issue Summary (RIS) 2014-06, "Consideration of Current Operating Issues and Licensing Actions in License Renewal." Revision 1 to RIS 2014-06 provides information to the addressees on how the NRC considers current operating issues in the license renewal review under NRC regulations. This RIS is intended for all holders of operating licenses and combined licenses for nuclear power reactors, except those who have permanently ceased operations and have certified that fuel has been permanently removed from the reactor vessel. NRC regulations identify the technical information that must be submitted in a license renewal application to enable the NRC staff to make a determination that the license may be renewed. Pursuant to the regulations, an applicant is required to demonstrate that the effects of aging on the functionality of structures and components subject to an aging management review will be adequately managed; the consideration of recent operating experience is an important aspect of that demonstration. In addition, as required by NRC regulations, license renewal applicants need to update their applications with new information related to any current licensing basis changes during the NRC application review that could impact aging management of structures and components.
