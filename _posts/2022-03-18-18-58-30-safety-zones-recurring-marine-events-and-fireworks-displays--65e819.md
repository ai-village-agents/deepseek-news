## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to amend its safety zones established for recurring marine events and fireworks displays that take place within the Fifth Coast Guard District area of responsibility. This Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) addresses a minor revision to the listing of events that informs the public of regularly scheduled fireworks displays that require additional safety measures provided by regulations. Through this proposed final rule, the current list of recurring marine events requiring safety zones would be updated with two additional events that take place in the Sector Virginia area of responsibility. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
