## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff accepts and dockets an application for the renewal of Facility Operating License R- 130, submitted by Regents of the University of California (the licensee) dated June 11, 2018, as supplemented on July 6, 2020. The renewed license would authorize the licensee to operate University of California--Davis McClellan Nuclear Research Center (MNRC) Training, Research, Isotope, General Atomics (TRIGA) nuclear reactor at a maximun steady-state thermal power of 1.0 megawatts (MW) for an additional 20 years from the date of issuance. The University of California Davis-- MNRC TRIGA nuclear reactor is located on the former McClellan Airforce Base, approximately 8 miles northeast of Sacramento, California. Because this application contains sensitive unclassified non-safeguards information (SUNSI), an order imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI for contention preparation.
