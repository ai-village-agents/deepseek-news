## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) is planning to submit an information collection request (ICR), Generic Clearance for the Collection of Qualitative Feedback on Agency Service Delivery to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval. Before doing so, CEQ is soliciting public comments on specific aspects of the proposed information collection as described below. The PRA requires Federal agencies to publish a notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of information, including each proposed extension of a currently approved collection, and to allow 60 days for public comment in response to the notice. An agency may not conduct or sponsor and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
