## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2025-25- 02, which applied to all aircraft equipped with certain Aerospace & Defense Oxygen Systems SaS portable breathing equipment (PBE). AD 2025- 25-02 required incorporating revised procedures for donning the PBE. Since the FAA issued AD 2025-25-02, the agency determined the unsafe condition may be addressed by incorporating the updated procedures into documentation that is not identified in AD 2025-25-02 and that certain requirements in AD 2025-25-02 must be revised. This AD requires incorporating updated procedures for donning the PBE. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
