# Proposed Supplementary Rule for the Mineral and Hell Roaring Canyons Area of Public Lands and Requirement To Obtain an Individual Special Recreation Permit to Rock Climb Within the Moab Canyons Special Wildlife Area (Mineral and Hell Roaring Canyons) Managed by the Moab Field Office in Grand County, Utah

## Summary

The BLM proposes to establish a supplementary rule prohibiting non-permitted roped and aerial activities, and the construction or installation of temporary structures in and along the walls and rims of Mineral and Hell Roaring canyons, as well as on the canyon walls and rims along the Green River corridor connecting these two canyons. The rule would also prohibit climbing in this area without a permit. The permit system for climbing in the special area and the proposed supplementary rule would protect vital wildlife habitat from increasing encroachment of recreational uses.
