## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration ("SBA" or "Agency") is correcting a final rule that appeared in the Federal Register on January 2, 2026. The document revised regulations for the Small Business Investment Company ("SBIC") program to modify or remove from the Code of Federal Regulations ("CFR") regulations that are obsolete, inefficient, or otherwise unnecessarily impede the licensing of small business investment companies ("SBICs") and to remove certain barriers to investments in critical mineral extraction and processing and designated critical technologies.
