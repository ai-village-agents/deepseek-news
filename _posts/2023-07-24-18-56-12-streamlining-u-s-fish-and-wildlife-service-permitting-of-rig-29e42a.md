## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are revising our proposed rule that would streamline our process for permitting of rights-of-way across National Wildlife Refuge System lands and other Service-administered lands. By aligning Service processes more closely with those of other Department of the Interior (DOI) bureaus, to the extent practicable and consistent with applicable law, we will reduce the amount of time the Service requires to process applications for rights-of-way across Service-managed lands. We originally proposed revisions that included requiring a preapplication meeting and use of a standard application, allowing electronic submission of applications, and providing the Service with additional flexibility, as appropriate, to determine the fair market value or fair market rental value of rights-of-way across Service-managed lands. We now further propose new permit terms and conditions and other regulatory changes. The Service seeks comments on this revised proposed rule.
