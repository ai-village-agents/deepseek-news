## Summary

Based on affirmative final determinations by the Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the International Trade Commission (ITC), we are issuing an antidumping duty order on carbon and alloy steel threaded rod (threaded rod) from India. Additionally, we are amending our final affirmative determination of sales at less than fair value (LTFV) for carbon and alloy steel threaded rod from India as a result of a ministerial error.
