## Summary

This document requests comments on a Petition for Rulemaking filed by Hispanic Target Media Inc., proposing to amend the Table of FM Allotments, by substituting Channel 285C1 for vacant Channel 235C1 at Canadian, Texas to accommodate the hybrid modification application for Station KPQP that proposes the substitution of Channel 235C3 for Channel 291C3 at Panhandle, Texas. A staff engineering analysis indicates that Channel 285C1 can be allotted to Canadian, Texas, consistent with the minimum distance separation requirements of the Federal Communications Commission's (Commission) rules, with a site restriction of 6.1 km (3.8 miles) north of the community. The reference coordinates are 35-57-35 NL and 100-24-24 WL.
