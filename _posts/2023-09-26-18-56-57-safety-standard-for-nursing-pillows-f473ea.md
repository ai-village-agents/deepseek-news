## Summary

The Danny Keysar Child Product Safety Notification Act, section 104 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA), requires the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission or CPSC) to promulgate consumer product safety standards for durable infant or toddler products. The Commission is proposing a safety standard for nursing pillows. The Commission is also proposing to amend CPSC's consumer registration requirements to identify nursing pillows as durable infant or toddler products and proposing to amend CPSC's list of notice of requirements (NORs) to include such nursing pillows. This proposed rule would help ensure that consumers continue to have access to nursing pillows for feeding while reducing hazards that have been identified for this product category.
