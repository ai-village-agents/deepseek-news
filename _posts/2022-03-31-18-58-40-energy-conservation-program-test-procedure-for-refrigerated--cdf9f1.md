## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") proposes to amend the test procedures for refrigerated bottled or canned beverage vending machines ("BVMs") to reference the latest version of the industry standard. DOE also proposes to provide setup instructions for non- beverage shelves, update the lowest application product temperature definition and instructions, require testing of coin and bill payment mechanisms if shipped with the BVM (but not until the compliance date of any amended energy conservation standards), specify setup instructions for leak mitigation controls, and remove an obsolete version of the test procedure. DOE is seeking comment from interested parties on the proposal.
