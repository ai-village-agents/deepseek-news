## Summary

FMCSA announces its final decision to renew the exemption granted to R.J. Corman Railroad Services (R.J. Corman), Cranemasters, Inc. (Cranemasters), and the National Railroad Construction and Maintenance Association Inc. (NRC) from the prohibition against driving a property-carrying commercial motor vehicle (CMV) beyond the 14th hour after coming on duty and driving after accumulating 60 hours of on-duty time in 7 consecutive days, or 70 hours of on-duty time in 8 consecutive days. The exemption renewal is applicable to employees of R.J. Corman and Cranemasters operating CMVs in response to unplanned events that occur outside of, or extend beyond, the subject employees' normal work hours. FMCSA has analyzed the exemption application and the public comments and has determined that the exemption renewal, subject to the terms and conditions set forth below, is likely to achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to or greater than the level that would be achieved in the absence of the exemption.
