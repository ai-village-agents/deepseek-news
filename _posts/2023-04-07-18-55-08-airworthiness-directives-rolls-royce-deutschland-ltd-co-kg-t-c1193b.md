## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Trent 1000 model turbofan engines. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of excessive wear on the inner seal fins of certain high-pressure turbine (HPT) triple seals. This proposed AD would require an inspection of the HPT triple seal for excessive wear and, depending on the results of the inspection, replacement of the HPT triple seal and the intermediate- pressure turbine (IPT) disk, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
