## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is reopening the comment period for the proposed rule, published in the Federal Register of May 20, 2005, entitled "Food Standards; General Principles and Food Standards Modernization," to establish a set of general principles for food standards for FDA to use when considering whether to establish, revise, or eliminate a food standard. The proposed rule was issued jointly with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and, while FDA will continue to engage with USDA regarding the proposed rule, we are reopening the comment period to receive new data, information, or further comments only on FDA-specific aspects of the proposed rule, including FDA's 13 general principles.
