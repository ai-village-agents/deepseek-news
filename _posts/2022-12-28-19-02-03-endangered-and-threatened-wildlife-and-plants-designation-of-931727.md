## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to designate critical habitat for the federally threatened `i`iwi (Drepanis coccinea) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). In total, approximately 275,647 acres (111,554 hectares) on the islands of Kaua`i, Maui, and Hawai`i, in the State of Hawaii, fall within the boundaries of the proposed critical habitat designation. We also announce a public informational meeting and public hearing and the availability of a draft economic analysis of the proposed critical habitat designation.
