## Summary

On May 16, 2022, the President signed into law the Safe Sleep for Babies Act of 2021 (SSBA), requiring that crib bumpers, "regardless of the date of manufacture, shall be considered a banned hazardous product" under the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA). In light of that new statutory direction, CPSC is terminating its pending rulemaking proceeding on crib bumpers/liners, and in a separate notice of proposed rulemaking, proposing to codify the requirements for crib bumpers pursuant to the SSBA. The Commission is also terminating the related proposed rule amendment to include the safety standard for crib bumpers/liners in the list of notice of requirements, as well as the related proposed amendment to identify "crib bumpers/liners" as a durable infant or toddler product subject to CPSC's consumer registration requirements.
