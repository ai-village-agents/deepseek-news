## Summary

EPA has received a specific exemption request from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) to use the pesticide clothianidin (CAS No. 210-880-92-5) to treat up to 75,000 acres of immature (3-5 years old) citrus trees to control the transmission of Huanglongbing (HLB) disease vectored by the Asian Citrus Psyllid. The applicant proposes a use that has been requested in 5 or more previous years and for which a complete application for registration or tolerance petition has not been submitted to the Agency. Therefore, EPA is soliciting public comment before making the decision whether or not to grant the exemption.
