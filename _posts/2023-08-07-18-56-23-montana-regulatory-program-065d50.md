## Summary

We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), are announcing receipt of a proposed amendment to the Montana regulatory program (hereinafter, the Montana program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). During the 2023 legislative session, the Montana legislature passed Senate Bill 392 (SB 392), amending the Montana Strip and Underground Mine Reclamation Act (MSUMRA) as well as the Montana Code Annotated (MCA). Accordingly, Montana submitted this proposed amendment to OSMRE on its own initiative. Montana's proposal adds a provision for the equal application of court costs to the prevailing party in contested case proceedings by a court or administrative agency that issues a decision. The proposal also amends the MCA to reference the equal application of court costs in section1. Finally, the proposal includes codification instructions, a severability clause, an effective date, and an applicability statement. This document gives the times and locations that the Montana program and this proposed amendment to the program are available for your inspection, the comment period during which you may submit written comments on the amendment, and the procedures that we will follow for the public hearing, if one is requested.
