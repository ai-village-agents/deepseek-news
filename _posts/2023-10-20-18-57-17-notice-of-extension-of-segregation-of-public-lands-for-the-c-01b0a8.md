## Summary

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) on October 21, 2021, segregated public lands included in the right-of-way application (N- 089655) for the Copper Rays Solar Project from appropriation under the public land laws, including the Mining Law, but not the Mineral Leasing or Material Sales Acts, for a period of 2 years subject to valid existing rights. This 2-year extension of the segregation is necessary for the orderly administration of the public lands in order to allow the BLM to complete review of the Copper Rays Solar Project application and reach a decision on the application.
