## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) gives notice of availability of the final Guidance setting forth the nonbinding process that DOE plans to generally follow to designate National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors (NIETC) pursuant to the Federal Power Act. The Federal Power Act requires DOE to issue a report not less frequently than once every three years, which may designate as a NIETC any geographic area that is experiencing or is expected to experience electric energy transmission capacity constraints or congestion that adversely affects consumers. NIETC designation focuses public and policymaker attention on the areas of greatest transmission need and unlocks valuable Federal financing and permitting tools to advance transmission development.
