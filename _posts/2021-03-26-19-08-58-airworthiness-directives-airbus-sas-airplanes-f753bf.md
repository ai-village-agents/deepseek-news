## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of migration of the bushings of the horizontal tail plane (HTP) lateral load fittings (LLFs) on the left- and right-hand sides during flight test. This AD requires repetitive inspections for migration of the bushings of the HTP LLFs on the left- and right-hand sides, and terminating repair or modification of any affected bushing, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
