## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain MHI RJ Aviation ULC Model CL-600-2D15 (Regional Jet Series 705) and CL-600-2D24 (Regional Jet Series 900) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that the lower aft outboard supporting structure of galley 2 does not meet certification requirements for all flight and/or emergency landing loads. This proposed AD would require modifying the floor structure between certain fuselage stations. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
