## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering an application for the subsequent license renewal of Renewed Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-33, DPR-52, and DPR-68, which authorize Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to operate Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant (BFN), Units 1, 2, and 3. The subsequent renewed licenses would authorize TVA to operate BFN for an additional 20 years beyond the period specified in each of the current licenses. The current operating licenses for BFN expire as follows: Unit 1 on December 20, 2033, Unit 2 on June 28, 2034, and Unit 3 on July 2, 2036.
