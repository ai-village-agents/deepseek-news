## Summary

The Census Bureau will conduct two tribal consultations on the Detailed Demographic and Housing Characteristics File A (DHC-A) and Detailed Demographic and Housing Characteristics File B (Detailed DHC- B) on October 18, 2022, in Anchorage, Alaska and October 31, 2022, in Sacramento, California. Feedback on these products will help to determine the final content and design for the 2020 Census Detailed DHC-A and Detailed DHC-B. The tribal consultation meetings reflect the Census Bureau's continuous commitment to strengthen nation-to-nation relationships with federally recognized tribes. The Census Bureau's procedures for outreach, notice, and consultation ensure involvement of tribes to the extent practicable and permitted by law before making decisions or implementing policies, rules, or programs that affect federally recognized tribal governments. These meetings are open to citizens of federally recognized tribes by invitation. The Census Bureau provided questions in preparation for the tribal consultations focused on the Detailed DHC-A and Detailed DHC-B. In that regard, the Census Bureau is asking tribal governments review the proposed tables, levels of geography, and product design. Helpful feedback would include tables and geographies that are needed, how design changes may impact your work, and ways the Census Bureau can continue to effectively communicate with tribal leaders about these products. The purpose of the tribal consultations is to hear tribes' recommendations.
