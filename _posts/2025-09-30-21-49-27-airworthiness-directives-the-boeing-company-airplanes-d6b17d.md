## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 747-100, -100B, -100B SUD, -200B, - 200C, -200F, -300, -400, -400D, -400F, 747SP, and 747SR series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of corrosion damage found on a certain satellite communications (SATCOM) high gain antenna adapter plate. This proposed AD would require repetitive detailed inspections (DET) of the SATCOM high gain antenna adapter plate for corrosion and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
