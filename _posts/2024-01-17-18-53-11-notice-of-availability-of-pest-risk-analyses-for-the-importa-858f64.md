## Summary

We are advising the public that we have prepared pest risk analyses that evaluate the risks associated with the importation of fresh thyme, marjoram, and oregano from Kenya into the United States. Based on the analyses, we have determined that the application of one or more designated phytosanitary measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks of introducing or disseminating plant pests or noxious weeds via the importation of fresh thyme, marjoram, and oregano from Kenya into the United States. We are making the pest risk analyses available to the public for review and comment.
