## Summary

OSHA is reopening the comment period for an additional 60 days to allow for additional public comment on specific topics. Additionally, OSHA is postponing the tentatively scheduled informal public hearing. Before making any decisions about future proceedings, OSHA will review all of the comments on the proposal, including any comments submitted during the reopening of the comment period. Thus, any further decisions about the scheduling of a hearing are in abeyance until that time. Announcements about any future hearing dates will be published by notice in the Federal Register.
