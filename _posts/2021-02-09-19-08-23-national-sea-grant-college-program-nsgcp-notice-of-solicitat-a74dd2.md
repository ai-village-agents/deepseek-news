## Summary

The National Sea Grant College Program is requesting letters of intent from eligible applicants to become a Sea Grant Institutional Program serving the United States territory of Guam. An Institutional Program can be defined as a program that has demonstrated competence as a Coherent Area Program and has shown the ability to support broad responsibilities for the development of Sea Grant state, regional, and national activities, engaging all of the institutions of higher learning in the region. Only institutions that have been the host entity of a Sea Grant Coherent Area Program for at least three years are eligible to apply. The National Sea Grant College Act of 1976, as amended by 33 U.S.C. 1121 et seq.
