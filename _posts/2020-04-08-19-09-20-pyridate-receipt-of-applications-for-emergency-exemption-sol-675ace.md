## Summary

EPA has received specific exemption requests from the Oregon and Washington State Departments of Agriculture, Office of the Indiana State Chemist and the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development for the use of pyridate (CAS No. 55512-33-9) for postemergence control of herbicide-resistant weeds such as redroot pigweed and other broadleaf weeds to treat up to 5,200 acres of mint (peppermint and spearmint) in Oregon, 16,000 in Washington, 11,200 acres in Indiana, and 1,250 acres in Michigan. The applicants propose the use of a pesticide that was voluntarily canceled in 2004 and is now considered to be unregistered under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). This notice is consistent with the requirements for an unregistered chemical. EPA is soliciting public comment before making the decision whether to grant these exemptions.
