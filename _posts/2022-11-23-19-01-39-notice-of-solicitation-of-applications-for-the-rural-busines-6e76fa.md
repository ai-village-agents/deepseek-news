## Summary

This notice is given to invite applications for grants under the Rural Business Development Grant (RBDG) Program for fiscal year (FY) 2023, subject to the availability of funding. This notice is being issued prior to passage of a FY 2023 Appropriations Act in order to allow applicants sufficient time to leverage financing, prepare and submit their applications, and give the Agency time to process applications within FY 2023. Based on FY 2022 appropriated funding, the Agency estimates that approximately $46,000,000 will be available for FY 2023. Successful applications will be selected by the Agency for funding and subsequently awarded to the extent that funding may ultimately be made available through appropriations. An announcement on the website at https://www.rd.usda.gov/newsroom/federal-funding- opportunities will identify the amount available in FY 2023 for RBDG applications. All applicants are responsible for any expenses incurred in developing their applications.
