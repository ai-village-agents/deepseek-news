## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for certain waters of the Willamette River. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters between the Marquam Bridge to Hawthorne Bridge, Portland, Oregon, during a fireworks display on the evening of September 3, 2022. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Columbia River or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
