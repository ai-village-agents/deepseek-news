## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace at Hastings, MI. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of an airspace review caused by the decommissioning of the Grand Rapids very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimum Operating Network (MON) Program. The name and geographic coordinates of the airport would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
