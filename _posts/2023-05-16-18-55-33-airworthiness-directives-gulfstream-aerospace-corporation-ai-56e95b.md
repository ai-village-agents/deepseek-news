## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation Model G-1159A and G-1159B airplanes and all Model G-IV and GIV-X airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that the ground spoiler actuator installation does not preclude improper hydraulic line connections that could result in unintended asymmetrical spoiler deployment. This AD requires incorporating corrective actions that physically prevent improper connection of the hydraulic lines to the ground spoiler actuator. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
