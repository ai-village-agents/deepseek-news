## Summary

In accordance with the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA or the Act), notice is hereby given of a proposed consent decree in Citizens for Clean Air, et al. v. Michael S. Regan, et al., No. 2:22-cv-01382- RSL (W.D. Wa.). On September 28, 2022, Plaintiffs Citizens for Clean Air and Sierra Club filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington alleging that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) failed to perform a non-discretionary duty in accordance with the Act to take final action to approve, disapprove or conditionally approve, in whole or in part, a nonattainment state implementation plan (SIP) submission made by the State of Alaska. The State made the SIP submission at issue to address certain nonattainment area plan requirements for purposes of the 2006 24-hour PM<INF>2.5</INF> national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for the Fairbanks North Star Borough area. The proposed consent decree would establish a deadline for EPA to take final action on the SIP submission.
