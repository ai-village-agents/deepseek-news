## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-24- 09, which applied to certain Bell Textron Canada Limited Model 430 helicopters. AD 2021-24-09 required a visual inspection of the main rotor (M/R) pitch link clevis (clevis), rod end, and a certain part- numbered universal bearing, performing a purge grease, and performing a magnetic particle inspection of each M/R clevis, and depending on the inspection results, removing or replacing certain parts and performing additional actions. AD 2021-24-09 also required recurring inspections of each M/R clevis and each universal bearing. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-24-09, the manufacturer has reduced the life limits of the affected parts and introduced new M/R pitch link assemblies by re- identifying the M/R pitch link assemblies that were required to be inspected by AD 2021-24-09. This AD requires similar actions as AD 2021-24-09 but reduces the life limits and requires replacing the M/R pitch link assemblies with re-identified part numbered assemblies. These actions are specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
