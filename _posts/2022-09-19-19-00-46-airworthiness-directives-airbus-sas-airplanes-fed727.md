## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A330-200, A330-200 Freighter, A330-300, A330- 800, A330-900, A340-200, and A340-300 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that certain landing gear parts have been manufactured with improper material or using a deviating manufacturing process. This proposed AD would require replacing each affected part with a serviceable part, and for certain airplanes, re- assessing any previously repaired main landing gear (MLG) sliding piston, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. This proposed AD would also limit the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
