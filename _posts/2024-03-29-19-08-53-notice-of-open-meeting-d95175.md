## Summary

In accordance with the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Economic Advisory Council was established as a discretionary advisory committee on October 5, 2018. Its charter was most recently renewed on September 30, 2022, for two additional years. The MCC Economic Advisory Council serves MCC solely in an advisory capacity and provides advice and guidance to MCC economists, evaluators, leadership of the Department of Policy and Evaluation, and senior MCC leadership regarding relevant trends in development economics, applied economic and evaluation methods, poverty analytics, as well as modeling, measuring, and evaluating development interventions. In doing so, the MCC Economic Advisory Council helps sharpen MCC's analytical methods and capacity in support of the agency's economic development goals. It also serves as a sounding board and reference group for assessing and advising on strategic policy innovations and methodological directions in MCC.
