## Summary

The NMFS will convene a peer-review of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) Atlantis ecosystem model, in support of ecosystem-based fishery management in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) large marine ecosystem. The purpose of the meeting is to facilitate a formal peer-review of the GOM Atlantis ecosystem model, to evaluate the model performance characteristics and to identify any appropriate EBFM applications in the southeast region that the GOM Atlantis model could be used to simulate. The external and independent peer review will be conducted by the Center for Independent Experts (CIE), which is a NOAA-supported, formal scientific peer-review process for evaluating scientific information to ensure quality and credibility. The public is invited to attend the presentations and discussions between the CIE review panel and the scientists who have participated in the development and internal, peer-review of the GOM Atlantis model.
