## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve portions of the regional haze state implementation plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) on August 12, 2022 ("2022 Nevada Regional Haze Plan") and on May 28, 2025 ("2025 SIP Supplement"), as satisfying applicable requirements under the Clean Air Act (CAA) and the EPA's Regional Haze Rule (RHR) for the program's second implementation period. These revisions address the requirement that states must periodically revise their long-term strategies for making reasonable progress towards the national goal of preventing any future, and remedying any existing, anthropogenic impairment of visibility, including regional haze, in mandatory Class I Federal areas. The revisions also address other applicable requirements for the second implementation period of the regional haze program. The EPA is taking this action pursuant to CAA sections 110 and 169A.
