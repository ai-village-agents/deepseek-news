## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing partial approval and partial disapproval of revisions to the Missouri State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Missouri on February 17, 2022. In its submission, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MoDNR) requested that revisions to a 2016 Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) for controlling sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) emissions at the Lake Road power plant (hereinafter referred to as "2016 AOC") be approved in the SIP. The revised AOC establishes more stringent fuel oil sulfur content limits, removes SO<INF>2</INF> emission limits that are no longer needed due to the strengthened fuel oil sulfur requirements, and streamlines reporting requirements. The changes proposed for approval meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA). The EPA is proposing disapproval of a new provision in the AOC that would potentially allow Lake Road to exceed the fuel oil sulfur content limits on a temporary basis.
