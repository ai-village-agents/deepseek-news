## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA), Office of Land and Emergency Management (OLEM), Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Information (OSRTI), is giving notice that it proposes to modify a system of records pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. Superfund Enterprise Management System (SEMS) is being modified to expand the categories of records that may be housed in SEMS and the categories of individuals who may be covered by the system. Additionally, EPA is modifying SEMS to add General Routine Uses B, D, and M, modify General Routine Use L, and add three Specific Routine Uses. The new Specific Routine Uses are related to disclosure of records to protect the environment or public health or safety, including carrying out an investigation or response; to share information with the public in cases of emergency to protect the environment or public health and safety; and to respond to other external requests for information to support programmatic functions. This system of records is an electronic repository of Superfund documents routinely used to house and organize data and information regarding Superfund sites. Records contained in SEMS are used in support of programmatic functions including investigation; cleanup; program planning; community outreach; coordination with state, local and tribal entities; listing and de-listing of Superfund sites; enforcement activities; and litigation. Information related to Superfund sites may be gathered under other statutory authorities because SEMS is an accessible repository for selected non- Superfund sites as well. Privacy is maintained by limiting access to the database containing confidential business and personal information. All exemptions and provisions included in the previously published System of Records Notice (SORN) for SEMS will transfer to the modified SORN for SEMS.
