# Transforming the 2.5 GHz Band

**Published:** February 05, 2026 19:08 UTC

## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) is correcting final rules that appeared in the Federal Register on October 25, 2019. The published rules contained language stating that certain rules were not currently effective, because the FCC was awaiting Paperwork Reduction Act approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In fact, OMB had previously granted Paperwork Reduction Act approval, and the language in question was unnecessary. By correcting these amendments, the FCC removes unnecessary rules.
