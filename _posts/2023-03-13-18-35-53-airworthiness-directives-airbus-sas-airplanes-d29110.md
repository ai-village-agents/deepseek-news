## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A321-251NX, A321-252NX, A321-253NX, A321-271NX and A321-272NX airplanes. This AD was prompted by an emergency exit slide deployment test on an Airbus Cabin Flex (ACF) overwing emergency exit, the emergency exit slide did not deploy due to disconnected slide release cable junction. This AD requires a one-time detailed inspection of the installation of the ACF overwing emergency exit slide release mechanism for discrepancies, and applicable corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
