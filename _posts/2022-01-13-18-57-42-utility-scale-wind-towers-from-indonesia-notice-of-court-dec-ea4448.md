## Summary

On December 28, 2021, the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) issued its final judgment in PT. Kenertec Power System v. United States, Consol. Ct. No. 20-03687, sustaining the Department of Commerce (Commerce)'s remand redetermination pertaining to the countervailing duty (CVD) investigation of utility scale wind towers (wind towers) from Indonesia covering the period of investigation, January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2018. Commerce is notifying the public that the CIT's final judgment is not in harmony with Commerce's final determination in that investigation and that Commerce is amending the final determination with respect to the countervailable subsidy rate determined for PT. Kenertec Power System (Kenertec). Because the amended countervailable subsidy rate determined for Kenertec, the only individually-examined respondent in the investigation, is now de minimis, Commerce is hereby revoking the CVD order.
