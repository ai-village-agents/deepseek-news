## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-100-1A10 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that during ALTS CAP or (V) ALTS CAP mode, the flight guidance/autopilot does not account for engine failure while capturing an altitude. This AD requires revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to provide the flightcrew with new warnings for "Autoflight" and "Engine Failure in Climb During ALTS CAP." The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
