## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued an Order approving the indirect transfer of several licenses for Westinghouse Electric Company, LLC (Westinghouse). Westinghouse is the holder of special nuclear materials (SNM) license number SNM-1107, which authorizes the possession and use of SNM at the Columbia Fuel Fabrication Facility in Hopkins, South Carolina. Westinghouse is also the holder of several export licenses as noted in the Order. The Order approves the indirect transfer of control of these licenses resulting from the acquisition of Westinghouse's intermediate parent company, Brookfield WEC Holdings Inc., by Watt New Aggregator L.P., in which Brookfield Corporation will hold a controlling 51 percent interest and Cameco Corporation will hold the remaining 49 percent interest. The Order became effective upon issuance.
