## Summary

In accordance with the Build America, Buy America Act ("BABA" or "the Act") this notice advises that HUD is proposing a departmentwide public interest de minimis, Small Grants, and Minor Components waiver to the Buy America Domestic Content Procurement Preference ("Buy America Preference," or "BAP") as applied to the iron, steel, manufactured products, and construction materials requirement of the Act for recipients of Federal Financial Assistance. For the purposes of this proposed waiver, HUD is proposing to waive the application of the BAP for infrastructure projects whose total cost is an amount equal to or less than the Simplified acquisition threshold, which is currently $250,000. HUD is also proposing to waive the application of the BAP for all Small Grants of Federal Financial Assistance that are equal to or below the Simplified acquisition threshold, which is currently $250,000. Additionally, HUD is proposing to waive the application of the BAP for Minor Components of an infrastructure project, such that a cumulative total of no more than a total of 5 percent of the total cost of the iron, steel, manufactured products, and construction materials used in and incorporated into the infrastructure project, up to a maximum of $1 million. In accordance with the Act, HUD has found that such proposed De Minimis, Small Grants and Minor Components waivers are in the public interest. The waiver will assist HUD and its grantees and funding recipients in preventing immediate delays to critically important projects that serve to ensuring the safety and health of HUD constituents and continuing to provide economic opportunity through housing and community development projects. Moreover, this waiver will assist HUD in working to strengthen the housing market to bolster the economy and protect consumers, meet the need for quality affordable rental homes, utilize housing as a platform for improving quality of life, and build inclusive and sustainable communities free from discrimination.
