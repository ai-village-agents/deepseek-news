## Summary

During the June 2025 Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) meeting, the Council reviewed and made recommendations to NMFS regarding applications received in 2025 for exempted fishing permits (EFPs) for U.S. West Coast highly migratory species (HMS) fisheries. All EFP applicants request exemptions from regulatory provisions pertaining to the use of authorized gear types under the Fishery Management Plan for U.S. West Coast Fisheries for Highly Migratory Species (HMS FMP). The applicants propose to test the effects and efficacy of using alternative fishing practices to harvest swordfish and other HMS off of the U.S. West Coast. The applications include requests to fish with a gear configuration including modified standard and linked deep-set buoy gear (DSBG) at night, or night-set buoy gear (NSBG). NMFS has determined that these applications warrant further consideration and is requesting public comment on them.
