## Summary

This regulation establishes exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of D-glucopyranose, oligomeric, maleates, decyl octyl glycosides, sulfonated, potassium salts; D-glucopyranose, oligomeric, maleates, C10-16-alkyl glycosides, sulfonated, potassium salts; and D-glucopyranose, oligomeric, maleates, C9-11-branched and linear alkyl glycosides, sulfonated, potassium salts when used as inert ingredients (surfactants) pre- and post-harvest. Lamberti USA, Inc. submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting establishment of exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of D-glucopyranose, oligomeric, maleates, decyl octyl glycosides, sulfonated, potassium salts; D-glucopyranose, oligomeric, maleates, C10-16-alkyl glycosides, sulfonated, potassium salts; and D-glucopyranose, oligomeric, maleates, C9-11-branched and linear alkyl glycosides, sulfonated, potassium salts, when used in accordance with the terms of these exemptions.
