## Summary

The Maritime Administration (MARAD) invites public comments on our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The proposed collection OMB 2133-0018 (Title XI Obligations Guarantees) will be used to evaluate an applicant's project and capabilities, make the required determinations, and administer any agreements executed upon approval of loan guarantees. This collection is being updated to include minor changes to the instructions to streamline the data collection process through electronic submission capability. There is also a reduction in the public burden since the last renewal. We are required to publish this notice in the Federal Register to obtain comments from the public and affected agencies.
