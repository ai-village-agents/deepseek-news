## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a revised guidance for industry entitled "Submission of Plans for Cigarette Packages and Cigarette Advertisements (Revised)." This is a revision to the second edition of this final guidance, which issued in May 2020, and is intended to assist those required to submit cigarette plans for cigarette packages and cigarette advertisements by providing content, timing, and other recommendations related to those submissions. FDA is revising this guidance to reflect the December 2, 2020, court order that postponed the effective date of the final rule entitled "Tobacco Products; Required Warnings for Cigarette Packages and Advertisements" to January 14, 2022. Pursuant to the court order, this revised guidance strongly encourages entities to submit cigarette plans to FDA as soon as possible after publication of the final rule, and in any event, by March 16, 2021.
