## Summary

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) publishes this notice of a modified system of records entitled the "Congressional Relations and Correspondence Records," formerly named the "Congressional Relations, Inquiries and Travel Records," and this rescindment of a system of records notice entitled "Public Information Records." The modified system of records replaces the system of records entitled "Public Information Records." USAID proposes the rescission to eliminate the duplicative reporting. The records contained in the Public Information Records will be covered by the modified "Congressional Relations and Correspondence Records" and the USAID SORN entitled, "Freedom of Information Act, Privacy Act, and Mandatory Declassification Review Requests Records."
