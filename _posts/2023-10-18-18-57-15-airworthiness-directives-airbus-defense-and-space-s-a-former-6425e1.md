## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-02-18, which applies to all Airbus Defense and Space S.A. Model CN-235, CN-235-100, CN-235-200, and CN-235-300 airplanes and Model C- 295 airplanes. AD 2021-02-18 requires repetitive inspections for cracking or broken rivets of certain left- and right-hand stringers and surrounding structure, and repair if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-02-18, a modification was developed to reinforce the structure in the affected area, providing terminating action for the repetitive inspections required by AD 2021-02-18. This proposed AD continues to require the actions in AD 2021-02-18 and proposes to require the new terminating action for the repetitive inspections, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
