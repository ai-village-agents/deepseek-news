## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of Baicalin anhydrous and Baicalin hydrate when used as inert ingredients (stabilizer) on growing crops pre- harvest, limited to a maximum concentration of 10% of the end-use formulation. Exponent, Inc. on behalf of UPL NA Inc. submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of baicalin anhydrous and baicalin hydrate, when used in accordance with the terms of those exemptions.
