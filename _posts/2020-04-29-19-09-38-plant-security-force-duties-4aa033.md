## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is withdrawing Regulatory Guide (RG) 5.43, "Plant Security Force Duties." RG 5.43 was published in January 1975 to provide guidance to applicants and licensees subject to NRC regulations on the organization of plant security forces and the duties of guards, watchmen, and other individuals responsible for security, as described in their facilities' security plans. RG 5.43 is being withdrawn because it contains regulatory guidance that is out of date and is no longer the preferred method for these applicants and licensees to use to meet the requirements. Future applicants and licensees may use several other more relevant regulatory guidance documents to meet those regulatory requirements.
