## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is publishing a final rule to amend the compliance date for its manufactured housing energy conservation standards. Currently, manufacturers must comply with these standards on and after May 31, 2023. This final rule delays compliance until July 1, 2025, for Tier 2 homes, and until 60 days after issuance of enforcement procedures for Tier 1 homes. DOE is delaying the compliance date to allow DOE more time to establish enforcement procedures that provide clarity for manufacturers and other stakeholders regarding DOE's expectations of manufacturers and DOE's plans for enforcing the standards.
