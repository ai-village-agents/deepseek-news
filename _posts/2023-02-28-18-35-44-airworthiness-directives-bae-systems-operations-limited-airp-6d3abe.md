## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain BAE Systems (Operations) Limited Model Avro 146-RJ series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that certain inertial reference units (IRUs) have out-of-date magnetic variation (MagVar) tables. This AD requires assessing the values between the MagVar tables of the affected IRUs and the most recently published MagVar data tables, and corrective actions if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
