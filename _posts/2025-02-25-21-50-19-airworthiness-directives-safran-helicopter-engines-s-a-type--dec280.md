## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Safran Helicopter Engines, S.A. (Safran) Model ARRIUS 2B2 engines. This proposed AD was prompted by a manufacturer review of collected data from in-service engines that indicated the preference injector may clog over time caused by fuel coking, which decreases the permeability of the preference injector. This proposed AD would require initial and repetitive non-extinguishing tests for engine flameout and replacement of the preference injector if necessary, a one-time modification (software upgrade) of the electronic engine control unit (EECU) and, for certain engines, repetitive replacements of the preference injector, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
