## Summary

We are advising the public that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has prepared a final environmental assessment (EA) and finding of no significant impact relative to permitting the release of an insect, Lilioceris egena, for the biological control of air potato (Dioscorea bulbifera) in the continental United States. Based on our finding of no significant impact, we have determined that an environmental impact statement need not be prepared.
