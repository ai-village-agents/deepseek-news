Pursuant to its Procedure for Public Participation in the Formulation of Marketing Policy, published in the Federal Register of July 6, 1978, Southeastern Power Administration (Southeastern) intends to revise the Georgia-Alabama-South Carolina System of Projects marketing policy by including provisions regarding renewable energy certificates (RECs). The current power marketing policy was published on December 28, 1994, for the Georgia-Alabama-South Carolina System, and is reflected in contracts for the sale of system power, which are maintained in the Southeastern headquarters office. Southeastern solicits written comments and proposals in formulating the proposed marketing policy revision.
