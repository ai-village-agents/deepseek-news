## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-14-09, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and - 1041 airplanes. AD 2023-14-09 requires an inspection for missing or incorrectly applied sealant in the wing tanks, applicable corrective actions, and a modification to restore two independent layers of lightning strike protection. Since the FAA issued AD 2023-14-09, Airbus provided inspection instructions for a new inspection area of the upper and lower, front and rear spar corner fittings for certain airplanes. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2023-14-09 and would require a one-time detailed inspection (DET) for missing or incorrectly applied sealant of the front and rear spars for certain airplanes and applicable on-condition actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
