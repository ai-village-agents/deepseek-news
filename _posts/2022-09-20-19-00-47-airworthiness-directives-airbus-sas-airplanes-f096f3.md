## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports indicating that protective caps were found on engine fire extinguishing pipes in the engine core zone (Zone 2) after airplane delivery. This proposed AD would require a one- time inspection of the engine fire extinguishing pipes for the presence of protective caps and removal of any protective caps found, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
