## Summary

The meeting of the Blood Products Advisory Committee (BPAC) scheduled for April 2-3, 2020, is postponed. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), like other government agencies, is taking the necessary steps to ensure the Agency is prepared to continue our vital public health mission in the event that our day-to-day operations are impacted by the COVID-19 public health emergency. Therefore, we are canceling or postponing all non-essential meetings through the month of April. We will reassess on an ongoing basis for future months. Therefore, this meeting is being postponed. The meeting was announced in the Federal Register on February 13, 2020.
