## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Saab AB, Support and Services Model 340A (SAAB/SF340A) and SAAB 340B airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that there is no evidence that post-machining stress relief or de-embrittlement post- cadmium plating treatments were performed on certain torque arm center pins. This AD requires replacing each affected torque arm center pin on the main landing gear (MLG), as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also prohibits the installation of affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
