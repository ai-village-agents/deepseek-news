## Summary

The Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) proposes a funding priority under the State Personnel Development Grants (SPDG) program, which assists States in reforming and improving their systems for personnel preparation and personnel development in order to improve results for children with disabilities. We take this action to focus attention on the need to improve results for children with disabilities and their families by supporting a comprehensive system of personnel development (CSPD) for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Part C Grants for Infants and Families program. The Department may use the proposed priority for competitions in fiscal year (FY) 2022 and later years.
