# Pacific Island Fisheries; 2022-2025 Annual Catch Limits and Accountability Measures for Main Hawaiian Islands Deepwater Shrimp and Precious Coral Fisheries

## Summary

In this final rule, NMFS implements annual catch limits (ACL) and accountability measures (AM) for main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) deepwater shrimp and precious coral for each fishing year in the time period between 2022 and 2025. As a post-season AM, if NMFS determines that the average total catch from the most recent 3 fishing years exceeded an ACL in a fishing year, we would reduce the ACL for the following fishing year by the amount of the overage. Although the 2022 fishing year for deepwater shrimp has ended, we will evaluate 2022 catches against the final ACL when data become available. This final rule supports the long-term sustainability of MHI deepwater shrimp and precious coral.
