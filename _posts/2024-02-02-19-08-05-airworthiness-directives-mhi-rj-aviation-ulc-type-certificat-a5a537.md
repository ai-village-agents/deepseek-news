## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain MHI RJ Aviation ULC Model CL-600-2B19 (Regional Jet Series 100 & 440) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that a more restrictive airworthiness limitation is necessary. This proposed AD would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate a more restrictive airworthiness limitation, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
