## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a guidance for industry entitled "Notifying FDA of a Permanent Discontinuance or Interruption in Manufacturing Under Section 506C of the FD&C Act." Due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, FDA has been closely monitoring the medical product supply chain with the expectation that it may be impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, potentially leading to supply disruptions or shortages of drug and biological products in the United States. The guidance is intended to assist applicants and manufacturers in providing FDA timely, informative notifications about changes in the production of certain drugs and biological products that will, in turn, help the Agency in its efforts to prevent or mitigate shortages of such products. Given the public health emergency presented by COVID-19, this guidance document is being implemented without prior public comment because FDA has determined that prior public participation is not feasible or appropriate, but it remains subject to comment in accordance with the Agency's good guidance practices. In addition, this guidance is intended to remain in effect for the duration of the public health emergency related to COVID-19 declared by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). However, the recommendations and processes described in the guidance are expected to assist the Agency more broadly in its efforts to prevent and mitigate shortages, including under circumstances outside of the COVID-19 public health emergency and reflect the Agency's current thinking on this issue. Therefore, within 60 days following the termination of the public health emergency, FDA intends to revise and replace this guidance with any appropriate changes following the public health emergency and in consideration of comments received on this guidance and the Agency's experience with implementation.
