## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-06- 03, which applied to all The Boeing Company Model 777F series airplanes. AD 2021-06-03 required deactivating the potable water system. This AD was prompted by a report of a water supply line that detached at a certain joint located above an electronic equipment (EE) cooling filter, leading to water intrusion into the forward EE bay. This AD retains the actions required by AD 2021-06-03 and requires installing a shroud to the water supply line in the forward cargo compartment, and performing a leak test of the potable water system. For certain airplanes, this AD also requires replacing tubes and hoses from the water supply line and installing a shroud to the water return line. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
