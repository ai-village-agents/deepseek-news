## Summary

This proposed rule would establish a fee for parties filing a voluntary notice of certain transactions for review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). In establishing a fee for such notices, this proposed rule would implement section 1723 of the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018, which amends section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 to allow CFIUS to collect fees.
