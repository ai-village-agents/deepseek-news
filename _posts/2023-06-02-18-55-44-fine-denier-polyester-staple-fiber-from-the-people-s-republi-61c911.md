## Summary

As a result of this expedited first sunset review, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) finds that revocation of the countervailing duty (CVD) order on fine denier polyester staple fiber (fine denier PSF) from the People's Republic of China (China) would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of countervailable subsidies at the levels indicated in the "Final Results of Sunset Review" section of this notice.
