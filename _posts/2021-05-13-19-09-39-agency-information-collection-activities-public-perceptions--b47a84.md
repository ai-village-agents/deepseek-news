## Summary

DHS S&T will submit the following Information Collection Request (ICR) to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and clearance in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The survey will collect information from the public regarding applications of artificial intelligence, including facial recognition. DHS has already used or piloted AI-based technologies in several of its key functions, including customs and border protection, transportation security, and investigations. However, AI in general and facial recognition in particular are not without public controversy, including concerns about bias, security, and privacy. Therefore, understanding how the public perceives these technologies, and then designing and deploying them in a manner responsive to the public's concerns, is critical in gaining public support for DHS's use of these technologies.
