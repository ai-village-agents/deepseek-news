## Summary

In accordance with section 113(g) of the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA or the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) is providing notice of a proposed consent decree in East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice v. EPA, No. 22-cv-0094 (D.D.C.). On January 13, 2022, Plaintiffs East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice, Ironbound Community Corporation, and Sierra Club (collectively Plaintiffs) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that the EPA failed to perform its non-discretionary duty under to review and, if appropriate, revise new source performance standards and emissions guidelines for large municipal solid waste incinerators (LMWCs) at five-year intervals. In addition, Plaintiffs filed a separate petition on December 21, 2021, in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia seeking a writ of mandamus relating to a 2008 order of that court remanding to the EPA performance standards for LMWCs. EPA is providing notice of this proposed consent decree, which would resolve all claims in both cases by establishing deadlines for EPA to issue proposed and final rulemakings to review and, if necessary, revise emissions standards for LMWCs.
