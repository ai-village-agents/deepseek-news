## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-18- 09, which applied to all Lockheed Martin Corporation/Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company Model 382, 382B, 382E, 382F, and 382G airplanes; and Model C-130A, HP-C-130A, EC-130Q, C-130B, and C-130H airplanes. AD 2019-18-09 required a visual inspection of the center wing upper and lower rainbow fittings for cracks, an eddy current inspection of the center wing lower rainbow fittings for cracks, and replacement if necessary. This AD was prompted by an analysis of reported cracks showing repetitive inspections are needed to adequately address cracked inner tangs of the center wing lower rainbow fittings. This AD requires repetitive inspections of the center wing upper and lower rainbow fittings for cracks and replacement if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
