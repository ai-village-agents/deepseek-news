## Summary

This action supplements our proposed amendments to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Lime Manufacturing Plants (Lime Manufacturing NESHAP) published in the Federal Register on January 5, 2023. In that action, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions standards for the following pollutants: hydrogen chloride (HCl), mercury, total hydrocarbon (THC) as a surrogate for organic HAP, and dioxin/furans (D/F). The EPA is proposing revisions to the proposed emission limits for HCl, mercury, organic HAP, and D/F based on additional information gathered since the publication of the January 5, 2023, proposed rule amendments. We solicit comments on all aspects of this proposed action.
