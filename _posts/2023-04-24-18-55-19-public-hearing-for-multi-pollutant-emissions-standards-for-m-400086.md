## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing a two- day virtual public hearing to be held on May 9 and May 10, 2023, on its proposal titled, "Multi-Pollutant Emissions Standards for Model Years 2027 and Later Light-Duty and Medium-Duty Vehicles," which was signed by Administrator Regan on April 11, 2023. An additional session may be held on May 11, 2023, if necessary to accommodate the number of testifiers that sign up to testify. EPA is proposing new, more stringent emissions standards for greenhouse gases (GHG) and criteria pollutants for light-duty vehicles and Class 2b and 3 ("medium-duty") vehicles that would phase-in over model years 2027 through 2032. In addition, EPA is proposing GHG program revisions in several areas, including off-cycle and air conditioning credits and vehicle certification and compliance. EPA also is proposing new standards to control refueling emissions from incomplete medium-duty vehicles, and battery durability and warranty requirements for light-duty and medium- duty plug-in vehicles.
