## Summary

In December 2020, DHS and DOJ (collectively, "the Departments") issued a final rule that clarified when an alien who poses a public health risk is ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal and revised their credible fear screening regulations. After multiple delays, the rule is scheduled to take effect on December 31, 2025. However, since December 2020, the Departments have further amended their regulations, complicating the codification of the 2020 rule. In this final rule, the Departments are withdrawing certain amendments from the 2020 rule while leaving unaltered the rule's substantive public health-related provisions, which will become effective as scheduled.
