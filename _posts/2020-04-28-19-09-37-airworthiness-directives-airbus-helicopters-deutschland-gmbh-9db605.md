## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH Model MBB-BK 117 D-2 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of an erroneous low rotor revolutions per minute (RPM) indication after establishing a one engine inoperative (OEI) condition. This proposed AD would require a software (SW) modification for the aircraft management computer (AMC). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
