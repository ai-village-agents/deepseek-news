## Summary

This final rule adopts, without change, an interim final rule implementing a recommendation from the Raisin Administrative Committee (Committee) to temporarily suspend the continuance referendum requirement under the Federal marketing order for California raisins. This final rule continues in effect the temporary suspension to give precedence to the formal rulemaking process and to provide the California raisin industry time to operate under the marketing order, if amended, before the next scheduled continuance referendum.
