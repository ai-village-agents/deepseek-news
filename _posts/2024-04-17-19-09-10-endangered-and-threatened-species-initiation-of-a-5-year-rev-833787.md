## Summary

NMFS announces its intent to conduct a 5-year review of the endangered western distinct population segment (DPS) of the Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus). NMFS is required by the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to conduct 5-year reviews to ensure that listing classifications of species are accurate. The 5-year review must be based on the best scientific and commercial data available at the time of the review. We request submission of any such information on the western DPS (WDPS) of Steller sea lion, particularly information on their status, threats, and recovery that has become available since the previous 5-year review was issued in 2020.
