## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A330-200, A330-200 Freighter, A330-800, and A330-900 series airplanes; Model A330-301, -302, -303, -323, -342, and -343 airplanes; and Model A340-312 and -313 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of quality non-conformity on main landing gear (MLG) axles where the high velocity oxygen-fuel (HVOF) coating on the bearing journal runout areas had a coating that was thicker than allowable limits. This proposed AD would require repetitive inspections of the affected parts (MLG axles) for any discrepancy, corrective actions, and eventual replacement of affected parts, and would prohibit the installation of affected parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
