## Summary

This proposed rule would implement a special activities provision of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. The Coast Guard is proposing to establish five temporary safety zones for the safe splashdown and recovery of reentry vehicles launched by Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX) in support of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and privately chartered missions. The proposed temporary safety zones are located within the Coast Guard District Seven area of responsibility (AOR) offshore of Jacksonville, Daytona, Cape Canaveral, Tampa, and Tallahassee, Florida. This proposed rule would prohibit U.S.-flagged vessels from entering any of the temporary safety zones unless authorized by the District Commander of the Seventh Coast Guard District, a Coast Guard Captain of the Port, or a designated representative. Foreign-flagged vessels would be encouraged to remain outside the safety zones. This action is necessary to protect vessels and waterway users from the potential hazards created by reentry vehicle splashdowns and recovery operations in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). It is also necessary to provide for the safe recovery of reentry vehicles, and any personnel involved in reentry services, after the splashdown. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
