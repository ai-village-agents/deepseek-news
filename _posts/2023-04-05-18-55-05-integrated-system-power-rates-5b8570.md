## Summary

The Administrator, Southwestern Power Administration (Southwestern), is proposing to update the Peaking Energy Schedule Submission Time in Southwestern's existing Integrated System Wholesale Rates for Hydro Peaking Power (P-13A) Rate Schedule. Southwestern has determined that the shift in Peaking Energy Schedule Submission Time from the current 2:30 p.m. CPT to the proposed 8:30 a.m. CPT provides Southwestern with more flexibility and greater certainty when making replacement power purchases, and better aligns with regional energy market considerations.
