## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") proposes to establish definitions, a test procedure, and sampling and representation requirements for air cleaners. Currently, air cleaners are not subject to DOE test procedures or energy conservation standards. DOE proposes a test procedure for measuring the integrated energy factor for air cleaners. The proposed test method references the relevant industry standard, with certain proposed modifications. DOE is seeking comment from interested parties on the proposal.
