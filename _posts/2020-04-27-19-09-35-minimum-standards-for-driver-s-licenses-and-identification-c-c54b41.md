## Summary

This rule delays the date for card-based enforcement of the REAL ID regulations from October 1, 2020 until October 1, 2021. Beginning on that date, federal agencies may not accept a state-issued driver's license or identification card for official purposes from any individual unless such license or card is a REAL ID compliant driver's license or identification card issued by a state that DHS has determined is in full compliance as defined under this part. The regulations also permit federal agencies to accept for official purposes until September 30, 2020, certain non-compliant driver's licenses and identification cards. This rule extends that date, authorizing federal agencies to continue to accept non-compliant driver's licenses and identification cards until the new card-based enforcement deadline.
