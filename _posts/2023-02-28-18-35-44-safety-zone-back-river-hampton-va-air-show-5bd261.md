## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a safety zone for certain waters in the vicinity of the northwest branch of the Back River. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters near Langley Air Force Base, Hampton, VA, during an annual airshow. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from entry in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Virginia or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
