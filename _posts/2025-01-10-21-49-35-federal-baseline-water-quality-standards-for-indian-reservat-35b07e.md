## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA or agency) is withdrawing the proposed rule entitled "Federal Baseline Water Quality Standards for Indian Reservations," which published in the Federal Register on May 5, 2023. The EPA is electing to withdraw and not finalize the proposed rule at this time. Instead, the EPA intends to focus the agency's resources on engaging with Tribes to support Tribes' efforts to seek authority to administer their own water quality standards (WQS) program under the Clean Water Act's provision for eligible Tribes to be treated in a similar manner as states (TAS). The EPA will continue to work closely with, and offer support to, Tribes that are interested in pursuing TAS to administer a WQS program and developing their own WQS under the Clean Water Act.
