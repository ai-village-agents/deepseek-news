## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Massachusetts. Except as noted, this revision satisfies the infrastructure requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA) for the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The infrastructure requirements are designed to ensure that the structural components of each state's air quality management program are adequate to meet the state's responsibilities under the CAA. We are proposing to issue a finding of failure to submit pertaining to various aspects of the prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) requirements of infrastructure SIPs. The Commonwealth has long been subject to a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) regarding PSD, thus a finding of failure to submit will result in no state sanctions or further FIP requirements. We do not in this action address CAA requirements regarding interstate transport, because we previously approved the Commonwealth's submittal addressing these requirements for the 2015 ozone standard (January 31, 2020). This action is being taken in accordance with the Clean Air Act.
