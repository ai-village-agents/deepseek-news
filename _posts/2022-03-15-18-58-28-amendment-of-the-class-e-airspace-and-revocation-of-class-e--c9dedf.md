## Summary

This action amends the Class E airspace and revokes Class E airspace at Grove, OK. This action is due to an airspace review conducted as part of the decommissioning of the Neosho very high frequency (VHF) omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimal Operational Network (MON) Program. The geographic coordinates of the airport are also being updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
