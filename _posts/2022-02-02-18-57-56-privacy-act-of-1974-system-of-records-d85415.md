## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is modifying the systems of records listed in this notice to incorporate two routine uses related to breach of personally identifiable information (PII) pursuant to the Office of Management and Budget's Memorandum 17-12. The first routine use deals with the breach of an agency's own records, and the second addresses the disclosure of agency records to assist other agencies in their efforts to respond to a breach of their own records. The new routine use that addresses breaches of an agency's own records replaces the one OPM previously published November 30, 2015 at 80 FR 74815.
