## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for all navigable waters of the Ohio River from mile marker (MM) 602.5 to MM 603.5 from 7 p.m. to 1 a.m. on October 24 and 25, 2022. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters near Louisville, KY during a film stunt. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Ohio Valley or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
