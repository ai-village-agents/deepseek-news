## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the DoD is modifying and reissuing a current system of records originally titled, "Military OneSource Case Management System (CMS)," DPR 45, which is being renamed as "Military OneSource Business Operations Information System". This system of records was originally established by the USD(P&R) to collect and maintain records in the Military OneSource Case Management of individuals' eligibility for support as well as processing training registration, enrollment, requests, and self- motivated education/training for its Learning Management System. The Military OneSource is a call center and website providing comprehensive information on available benefits and services to Active Duty Military, Reserve and National Guard, eligible separated members and their family members. These benefits and services include financial counseling, educational assistance and benefits, relocation planning and preparation, quality of life programs, and family and community programs. In addition to formatting administrative changes, this modification changes the categories of individuals, categories of records, the system location, system manager, authorities, record source categories, policy and practices for storage, record access, contesting and notification procedures, as well as the routine uses within the SORN.
