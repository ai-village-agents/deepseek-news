## Summary

The National Institute of Justice (NIJ) plans to host a series of listening sessions with stakeholder organizations. The purpose of the listening sessions is for the NIJ Director to (1) to gather fact and information from stakeholder organizations about current challenges in the criminal justice and juvenile justice ecosystems that research could address and (2) to explain NIJ's priorities in regard to those challenges. NIJ's priorities are described at: https://nij.ojp.gov/ about/nij-director. Stakeholder organizations include law enforcement, corrections, courts, criminal justice, and public safety professional associations; current NIJ grant and cooperative agreement recipients; law enforcement, corrections, courts, and other criminal justice agencies; juvenile justice agencies; crime victims agencies; advocacy groups, including community-based entities that are dedicated to evidence-based public safety initiatives; and other organizations with a nexus to criminal justice and juvenile justice operations and research.
