## Summary

This notice makes minor revisions to and finalizes HUD's prior notice published on June 26, 2025, entitled "Proposed Changes in Mortgage Insurance Premiums Applicable to FHA Multifamily Insurance Programs" (FR-6522-N-01). That notice proposed revisions to HUD's 2016 notice that reduced mortgage insurance premiums (MIPs) for qualifying loans under three newly established MIP rate categories: Green and Energy Efficient Housing, Affordable Housing, and Broadly Affordable Housing. On January 20, 2025, President Trump signed a presidential memorandum, "Delivering Emergency Price Relief for American Families and Defeating the Cost-of-Living Crisis," which directed agencies to deliver price relief to the American people, as well as an Executive Order on Unleashing American Energy. To meet these goals, this notice reduces MIPs to 0.25% for all FHA Multifamily Insurance Programs. This notice further eliminates the MIP categories established in 2016, which are misaligned with the presidential memoranda and have become economically obsolete.
