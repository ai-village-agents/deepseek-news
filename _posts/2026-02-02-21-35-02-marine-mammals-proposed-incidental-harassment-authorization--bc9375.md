## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in response to a request under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA), as amended, from the U.S. Department of the Navy (Navy), propose to authorize nonlethal, incidental take by harassment of Southern Beaufort Sea polar bears (Ursus maritimus) from February 18, 2026, to April 18, 2026. The applicant requested this authorization for take by harassment that may result from activities associated with the mobilization, operation, and demobilization of a temporary ice camp, aircraft transportation, submarine training and testing, and research in the Beaufort Sea and Arctic Ocean. This proposed authorization, if finalized, would be for up to six takes of polar bears by Level B harassment only. No take by injury or mortality is requested, expected, or proposed to be authorized. The Navy's activities are considered military readiness activities pursuant to the MMPA. We invite comments on the proposed incidental harassment authorization and the accompanying draft environmental assessment from the public, Tribes, and local, State, and Federal agencies.
