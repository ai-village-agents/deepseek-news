## Summary

The Rural-Business Cooperative Service (the Agency) published a notice of solicitation of applications in the Federal Register of November 25, 2020 entitled "Inviting Applications for the Rural Energy for America," to allow potential applicants time to submit applications for financial assistance under the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) and allow the Agency time to process applications within the current FY 2021. The document contained an incorrect threshold for awarding points under the "size of request" scoring criteria as well as an incorrect number of points available for previous grantees and borrowers who have not received and accepted a grant award or guaranteed loan commitment within the 2 previous federal years.
