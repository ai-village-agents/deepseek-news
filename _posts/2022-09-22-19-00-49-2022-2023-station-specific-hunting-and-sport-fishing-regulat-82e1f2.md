## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are correcting one amendatory instruction in a final rule that published in the Federal Register on September 16, 2022. That rule opened, for the first time, two National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs, refuges) that are currently closed to hunting and sport fishing. In addition, the rule opened or expanded hunting or sport fishing at 16 other NWRs and added pertinent station-specific regulations for other NWRs that pertain to migratory game bird hunting, upland game hunting, big game hunting, or sport fishing for the 2022-2023 season.
