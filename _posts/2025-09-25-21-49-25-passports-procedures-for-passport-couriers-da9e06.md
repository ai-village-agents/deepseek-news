## Summary

The Department of State (the Department) establishes rules for the registration program and hand delivery procedures for courier companies used by applicants to transport their passport applications, and U.S. passports issued to them, to and from participating passport agencies. This supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking, along with the original notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), is intended to continue the program that was established by prior policy, to maintain vigilance over the security of the passport application process, to require companies to register with the Department prior to providing hand delivery services to certain applicants for U.S. passports, and to follow a uniform set of hand delivery procedures.
