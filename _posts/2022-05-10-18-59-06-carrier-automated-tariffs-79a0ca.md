## Summary

The Federal Maritime Commission (Commission) is seeking public comment on proposed modifications to its rules governing Carrier Automated Tariffs through this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). The proposed rule would remove the option for ocean common carriers to charge a fee to access their tariff; allow non-vessel operating common carriers (NVOCCs) to cross reference certain aspects of other carriers' terms in their tariffs; clarify the ability for NVOCCs to reflect increases in certain charges passed-through by other entities without notice; update the definition of co-loading to apply only to less than container loads; require that documentation be annotated with the names of all NVOCCs involved in a shipping transaction; and make other miscellaneous updates and clarifications to the regulation.
