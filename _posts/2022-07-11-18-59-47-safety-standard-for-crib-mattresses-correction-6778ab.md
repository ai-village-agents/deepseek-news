## Summary

On February 15, 2022, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) promulgated a final rule establishing a safety standard for crib mattresses. The crib mattress rule incorporated by reference a voluntary standard for crib mattresses that had been published by ASTM International (ASTM) and provided a uniform resource locator (URL) allowing the public to link to ASTM's website to retrieve a read-only, free copy of ASTM's voluntary standard for crib mattresses. In this document, CPSC is correcting the URL for ASTM's website stated in the final rule.
