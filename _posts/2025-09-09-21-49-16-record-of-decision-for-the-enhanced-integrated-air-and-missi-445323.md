## Summary

The MDA, as the lead agency, and the United States Army (USA), as a cooperating agency, are issuing this joint Record of Decision (ROD) to implement the construction, deployment, and operations and maintenance of the Enhanced Integrated Air and Missile Defense (EIAMD) system on Guam, a territory of the U.S. This action will enable MDA and USA to meet their congressional mandate for a persistent 360-degree layered Integrated Air and Missile Defense capability on Guam to address the rapid evolution of missile threats from regional adversaries. Specifically, this ROD documents the decision made, alternatives considered, and discussions of all related and anticipated impacts. In addition to the USA, the United States Air Force (USAF), United States Navy (USN), and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) are participating as cooperating agencies due to their jurisdiction or special expertise as it pertains to certain components of the selected alternative or for potentially affected operations and resources. The ROD details significant environmental impacts, outlines mitigation measures, and identifies the environmentally preferred alternative.
