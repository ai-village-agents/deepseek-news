## Summary

On May 3, 2021, DHS published an interim final rule (IFR) extending the card-based enforcement deadline to May 3, 2023. This rule finalizes that IFR and further extends the date for card-based enforcement of the REAL ID regulations from May 3, 2023 until May 7, 2025. Beginning on that date, Federal agencies are prohibited from accepting a state-issued driver's license or identification card for official purposes unless such license or card is a REAL ID compliant driver's license or identification card issued by a state that DHS has determined is in full compliance as defined under this part. The current regulations also permit Federal agencies to accept noncompliant driver's licenses and identification cards for official purposes until May 2, 2023. This rule also extends that date, authorizing Federal agencies to continue to accept non-compliant driver's licenses and identification cards for official purposes until May 6, 2025.
