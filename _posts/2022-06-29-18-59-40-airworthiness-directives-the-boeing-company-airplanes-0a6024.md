## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-24-04, which applies to all The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. AD 2020-24-04 requires revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to incorporate procedures for an approach with a localizer-based navigation aid, monitoring localizer raw data, calling out any significant deviations, and performing an immediate go around under certain conditions. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-24-04, the manufacturer has developed a modification to address the previously identified unsafe condition. The FAA has also identified a separate unsafe condition where misleading flight director (FD) guidance can be presented to the flightcrew under certain conditions. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions specified in AD 2020-24-04 and would require installing applicable software updates to the flight control module (FCM). Using updated software would terminate the retained AFM requirement in this AD. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe conditions on these products.
