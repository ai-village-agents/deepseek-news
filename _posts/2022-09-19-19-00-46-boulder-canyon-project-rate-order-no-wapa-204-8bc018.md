## Summary

The Deputy Secretary confirmed, approved, and placed into effect on an interim basis the Boulder Canyon Project (BCP) formula rates for electric service in Rate Schedule BCP-F11 and the fiscal year (FY) 2023 base charge and rates under Rate Schedule BCP-F11. The existing formula rates under Rate Schedule BCP-F10 and the current base charge and rates expire on September 30, 2022. Rate Schedule BCP-F11 does not change the formula rates, which are set forth in the governing terms of the BCP Electric Service Contract (ESC). While the formula rates remain unchanged, the FY 2023 base charge for BCP electric service decreased 0.8 percent from $67.4 million in FY 2022 to $66.8 million in FY 2023.
