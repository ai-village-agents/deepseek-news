## Summary

The EPA is proposing to approve in part, conditionally approve in part, and disapprove in part a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Nevada pursuant to the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act") for the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of the 2015 national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for ozone. As part of this action, we are proposing to reclassify a region of the State for emergency episode planning purposes with respect to ozone. Finally, we are proposing to approve a regulatory revision into the Nevada SIP. We are taking comments on this proposal and, after considering any comments submitted, plan to take final action.
