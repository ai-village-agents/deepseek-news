## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) to amend the compliance date for its manufactured housing energy conservation standards. Currently, manufacturers must comply with these standards on and after May 31, 2023. DOE is proposing to delay this compliance date to allow DOE more time to establish enforcement procedures that provides clarity for manufacturers and other stakeholders.
