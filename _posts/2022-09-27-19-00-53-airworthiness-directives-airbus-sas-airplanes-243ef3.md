## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-07-10, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. AD 2022-07-10 requires revising the operator's existing FAA- approved minimum equipment list (MEL) to include dispatch restrictions. AD 2022-07-10 also allows operators to inspect affected parts for discrepancies, and do applicable replacements, in order to terminate the revision of the operator's existing MEL. AD 2022-07-10 also prohibits the installation of affected parts. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-07-10, a determination was made that the optional inspection and applicable replacements should be required. This proposed AD continues to require the actions in AD 2022-07-10, and would mandate the inspection of affected parts and applicable replacements, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which was incorporated by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
