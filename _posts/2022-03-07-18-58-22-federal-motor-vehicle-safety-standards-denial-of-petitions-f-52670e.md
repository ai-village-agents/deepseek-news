# Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Denial of Petitions for Rulemaking

## Summary

This document denies the September 27, 2021 petitions for rulemaking submitted by the Small Business in Transportation Coalition (SBTC) ("petitioner"). The petitioner requested that the agency initiate rulemaking to establish a new Federal motor vehicle safety standard (FMVSS) on the installation of electronic logging devices (ELDs), and to amend existing FMVSSs for heavy vehicle braking and accelerator control systems (i.e., FMVSS Nos. 105, 121, and 124). NHTSA is denying the petitions based on a lack of information necessary under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act and the allocation of agency resources.
