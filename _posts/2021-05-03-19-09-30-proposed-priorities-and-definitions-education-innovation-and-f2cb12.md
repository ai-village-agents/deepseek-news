## Summary

The Department of Education (Department) proposes priorities and definitions under the Education Innovation and Research (EIR) program, Assistance Listing Numbers 84.411A/B/C. The Department may use these priorities and definitions for competitions in fiscal year (FY) 2021 and later years. The Department proposes these priorities and definitions to support competitions under the EIR program for the purpose of developing, implementing, and evaluating projects designed to enhance instructional practice and improve achievement and attainment for high-need students in two key policy areas: Innovative approaches to addressing the impact of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on students and educators (namely, the interruption of traditional patterns of education due to school closures and the disproportionate social, emotional, physical and mental health, and academic impacts on particular student groups); and promoting equity in students' access to educational resources and opportunities. The Department believes that these priorities and definitions are essential to enable applicants to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and address equity issues.
