## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, are initiating 5-year status reviews of 27 species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A 5-year status review is based on the best scientific and commercial data available at the time of the review; therefore, we are requesting submission of any new information on these species that has become available since the last review of the species.
