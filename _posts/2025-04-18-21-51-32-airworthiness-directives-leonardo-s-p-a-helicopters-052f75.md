## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Leonardo S.p.a. Model A109C, A109E, A109S, and AW109SP helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of a quality escape on a batch of main rotor blades (MRBs). This AD requires repetitively tap inspecting certain MRBs and replacing those MRBs. This AD also prohibits installing those MRBs, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
