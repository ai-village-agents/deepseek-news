## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Commonwealth of Virginia. This revision provides Virginia's determination for the 2015 Ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS), via a negative declaration, that there are no sources within the Northern Virginia volatile organic compound (VOC) Emissions Control Area subject to EPA's 2016 Oil and Natural Gas control techniques guidelines (2016 Oil and Gas CTG). The negative declaration covers only the 2016 Oil and Gas CTG and asserts that there are no sources subject to this CTG located in the Northern Virginia VOC Emissions Control Area. This action is being taken under the Clean Air Act (CAA).
