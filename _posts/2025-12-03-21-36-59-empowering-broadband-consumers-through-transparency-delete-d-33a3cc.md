## Summary

In this document, the Commission seeks comment on several changes to the broadband label rules. Specifically, the Commission proposes to eliminate requirements that providers: (1) read the label to consumers over the phone; (2) itemize state and local passthrough fees that vary by location; (3) provide information about the now- concluded Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP); (4) display labels in customer account portals; (5) make labels available in machine readable format; and (6) archive labels for at least two years after a service is no longer offered to new customers. The Commission also seeks comment on streamlining and eliminating any other label requirement, such as the multilingual display requirement, that may be unduly burdensome and costly. The Commission also proposes to end our inquiry into new requirements that would take the labels out of alignment with the authorizing statute.
