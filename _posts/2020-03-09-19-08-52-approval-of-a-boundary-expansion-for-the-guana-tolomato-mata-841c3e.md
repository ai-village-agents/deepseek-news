## Summary

In accordance with applicable federal regulations, notice is hereby given that NOAA's Office for Coastal Management approved the final environmental assessment of a proposed boundary expansion for the Guana Tolomato Matanzas (GTM) National Estuarine Research Reserve in Florida. NOAA determined that the boundary expansion would not have significant environmental impacts and, therefore, issued a finding of no significant impact (FONSI). The final environmental assessment describes the alternatives considered, including the preferred alternative to add three parcels to the existing approved boundary, which would result in a net increase in size of 3,346.44 acres to the boundary. NOAA prepared a draft environmental assessment to analyze the effects of the requested expansion and solicited public comment before approving the request. The purpose of this notice is to inform the public of NOAA's approval of the boundary expansion and of the availability of the final environmental assessment.
