## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) responds to a remand from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit directing the Commission to assess the effects of the Commission's Restoring Internet Freedom Order on public safety, pole attachments, and the statutory basis for broadband internet access service's inclusion in the universal service Lifeline program. This document also amends the Commission's rules to remove broadband internet service from the list of services supported by the universal service Lifeline program, while preserving the Commission's authority to fund broadband internet access service through the Lifeline program.
