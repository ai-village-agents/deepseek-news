## Summary

The OCC, as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, invites comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA). In accordance with the requirements of the PRA, the OCC may not conduct or sponsor, and the respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The OCC is soliciting comment concerning a revision to its information collection titled, "Bank Secrecy Act/Money Laundering Risk Assessment," also known as the Money Laundering Risk (MLR) System. The OCC also is giving notice that it has sent the collection to OMB for review.
