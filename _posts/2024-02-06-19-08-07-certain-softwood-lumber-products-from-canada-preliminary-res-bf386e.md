## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily determines that countervailable subsidies are being provided to producers and exporters of certain softwood lumber products (softwood lumber) from Canada during the period of review (POR), January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2022. With respect to four companies, we are rescinding this administrative review because the companies are excluded from the countervailing duty (CVD) order on softwood lumber from Canada. Additionally, with respect to 70 companies, we are rescinding this administrative review because either the request for review of the company was timely withdrawn or the company did not have any reviewable entries of subject merchandise during the POR. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.
