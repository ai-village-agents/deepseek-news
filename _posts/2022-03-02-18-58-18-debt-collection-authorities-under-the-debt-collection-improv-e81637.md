## Summary

The Department of the Treasury ("Treasury"), Bureau of the Fiscal Service ("Fiscal Service"), proposes to amend its regulations regarding the Treasury Offset Program ("TOP") and the Cross-Servicing program. The primary reason for doing so is to inform the public about how Fiscal Service will use Social Security numbers in mailings, as required by the Social Security Number Fraud Prevention Act of 2017, which requires Fiscal Service to have final regulations in place by September 15, 2022.
