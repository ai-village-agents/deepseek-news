## Summary

The Rural Utilities Service (RUS or the Agency), a Rural Development (RD) Agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), announced its intent to solicit Letters of Interest (LOI) for Applications under the Powering Affordable Clean Energy (PACE) Program in a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) on May 16, 2023, in the Federal Register. In addition, the NOFO announced the Application process and deadlines, and the criteria that RUS will use to evaluate applications under the Powering Affordable Clean Energy (PACE) Program. These loan funds will be made to qualified PACE Applicants to finance power generation Projects for Renewable Energy Resource (RER) systems or Energy Storage Systems (ESS) that support RER Projects. The PACE Program has $1,000,000,000 available in appropriated funds under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). This notice is making amendments to ensure applicants know they are required to establish a Verified eAuthentication ID, to inform applicants that they are eligible for the PACE Program even if they are subject to a "cooling off period" under the Rural Electrification Act, and to notify applicants that the Agency will provide general assistance to applicants through the RUS' General Field Representatives (GFRs) prior to LOI submissions.
