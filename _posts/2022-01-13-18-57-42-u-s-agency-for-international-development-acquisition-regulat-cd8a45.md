## Summary

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) seeks public comment on a proposed rule to revise AIDAR in order to expand fringe benefits for personal services contracts with individuals who are U.S. nationals (USPSCs). Specifically, this rulemaking will provide a paid parental leave benefit comparable to what is available to USAID's U.S. direct-hire employees and provide a relocation expense reimbursement similar to the benefit provided to USAID's direct-hire Foreign Service Officer (FSO) employees.
