## Summary

In March 2023, HUD allocated more than $3 billion in Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) funds appropriated by the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2023 and the Department of Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act, 2023 for major disasters occurring in 2022. This Allocation Announcement Notice identifies grant requirements for these funds, including requirements in HUD's CDBG-DR Consolidated Notice ("Consolidated Notice") found in Appendix B, and a limited number of amendments to the Consolidated Notice that apply to CDBG-DR grants for disasters occurring in 2020, 2021, and 2022. The Consolidated Notice, as amended by this Allocation Announcement Notice, includes waivers and alternative requirements, relevant regulatory requirements, the grant award process, criteria for action plan approval, and eligible disaster recovery activities.
