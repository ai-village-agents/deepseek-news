## Summary

The Department of Commerce is correcting a final rule that appeared in the Federal Register on December 6, 2024. This final rule revises the regulations on the Department of Commerce's review of transactions involving information and communications technology and services designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied by persons owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a foreign adversary that may pose undue or unacceptable risk to the United States or U.S. persons. That rule inadvertently omitted instructions to update certain regulatory language included in the rule. This document corrects the omissions in the December 6, 2024 rule.
