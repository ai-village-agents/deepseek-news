## Summary

The Coast Guard is updating the type approval requirements for certain types of equipment that survival craft are required to carry on U.S.-flagged vessels. This rule will remove Coast Guard type approval requirements for nine of these types of survival craft equipment and replace them with the requirement that the manufacturer self-certify that the equipment complies with a consensus standard.
