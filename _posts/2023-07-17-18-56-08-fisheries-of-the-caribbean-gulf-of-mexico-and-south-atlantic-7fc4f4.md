## Summary

NMFS implements an accountability measure (AM) for the recreational harvest of golden tilefish in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the South Atlantic. NMFS estimates that recreational landings of golden tilefish have reached the recreational annual catch limit (ACL) for the 2023 fishing year. Accordingly, NMFS closes the recreational sector for the harvest of golden tilefish in the South Atlantic EEZ on July 17, 2023. This closure is necessary to protect the golden tilefish resource.
