On behalf of the United States Department of Agriculture, the United States Forest Service (USFS) filed an application with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) requesting that the Secretary of the Interior extend Public Land Order (PLO) No. 7593 for an additional 20- year term. PLO No. 7593 withdrew 80 acres of National Forest System land in Catron County, New Mexico, from location and entry under the United States mining laws, subject to valid existing rights, to protect the Davenport Electronic Site for a period of 20 years. The withdrawal created by PLO No. 7593 will expire on January 27, 2024, unless extended. This notice announces to the public an opportunity to comment on the withdrawal extension application and to request a public meeting.
