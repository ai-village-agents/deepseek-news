## Summary

The Department of Energy (DOE) submitted an information collection request for extension as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The information collection requests a three-year extension without changes to Form FE-746R, "Natural Gas Imports and Exports," OMB Control Number 1901-0294. The information collection request supports DOE's Office of Fossil Energy & Carbon Management (FECM) in gathering critical information on the U.S. trade in natural gas, including liquefied natural gas (LNG). The data are used to monitor natural gas trade, assess the adequacy of U.S. energy resources to meet near and longer-term domestic demands, and support various market and regulatory analyses done by FECM.
