## Summary

In accordance with the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2010, we are publishing this notice to advise the public of the availability of the FY 2020 Service Contract inventory. This inventory provides information on FY 2020 service contract actions over $25,000. We organized the information by function to show how we distribute contracted resources throughout the agency. We developed the inventory in accordance with guidance issued on December 19, 2011 by the Office of Management and Budget's Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP). OFPP's guidance is available at https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/ sites/default/files/omb/procurement/memo/service-contract-inventory- guidance.pdf.
