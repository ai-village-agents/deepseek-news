## Summary

FMCSA corrects its January 6, 2025, notice requesting comments for 19 individuals to renew exemptions from the Agency's requirement in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) that interstate commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers have no established medical history or clinical diagnosis of epilepsy or any other condition which is likely to cause loss of consciousness or any loss of ability to control a CMV. An individual's name was misspelled, and this notice corrects that error.
