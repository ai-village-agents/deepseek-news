## Summary

The Department of Labor (Department) is adopting a final rule defining when a person renders "investment advice for a fee or other compensation, direct or indirect" with respect to any moneys or other property of an employee benefit plan, for purposes of the definition of a "fiduciary" in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (Title I of ERISA or the Act). The final rule also applies for purposes of Title II of ERISA to the definition of a fiduciary of a plan defined in Internal Revenue Code (Code), including an individual retirement account or other plan identified in the Code. The Department also is publishing elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register amendments to Prohibited Transaction Exemption 2020-02 (Improving Investment Advice for Workers & Retirees) and to several other existing administrative exemptions from the prohibited transaction rules applicable to fiduciaries under Title I and Title II of ERISA.
