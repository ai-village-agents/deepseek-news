## Summary

The Coast Guard is withdrawing its notice of proposed rulemaking concerning the Mathers Bridge across the Banana River, mile 0.5, at Indian Harbour Beach, FL. The bridge owner, Brevard County Public Works Department, proposed to change the bridge operating schedule to allow for scheduled openings in order to reduce traffic delays. After careful consideration of the comments from all parties, it was determined to be in the best interest of navigation to withdraw the NPRM.
