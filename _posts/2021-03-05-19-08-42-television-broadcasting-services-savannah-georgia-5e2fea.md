## Summary

The Video Division has before it a petition for rulemaking filed November 27, 2020 (Petition) by Gray Television Licensee, LLC (Petitioner), the licensee of WTOC-TV (CBS), channel 11 (WTOC or Station), Savannah, Georgia. The Petitioner requests the substitution of channel 23 for channel 11 at Savannah, Georgia in the DTV Table of Allotments. In support of its channel substitution request, the Petitioner states that the Commission has recognized that VHF channels have certain propagation characteristics which may cause reception issues for some viewers, and also that the "reception of VHF signals require larger antennas . . . relative to UHF channels." According to the Petitioner, "many of its viewers experience significant difficulty receiving WTOC-TV's signal" and its channel substitution proposal will allow WTOC "to deliver a more reliable over-the-air signal to viewers. The Petitioner further states that its channel substitution proposal will result in no loss of service. We believe that the Petitioner's channel substitution proposal warrants consideration. Channel 23 can be substituted for channel 11 at Savannah, Georgia as proposed, in compliance with the principal community coverage requirements of section 73.625(a) of the Commission's rules at coordinates 32-3-15.0 N and 81-21-0.0 W. In addition, we find that this channel change meets the technical requirements set forth in sections 73.616 and 73.623 of the rules.
