## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing two temporary safety zones, a moving safety zone and a fixed safety zone, around the M/V HAPPY DIAMOND in the navigable waters of the Houston Ship Channel and its vicinity. The temporary safety zones are necessary to protect persons, property, and the marine environment from potential hazards associated with the transfer of large gantry cranes. Persons and vessels are prohibited from entering, transiting through, anchoring in, or remaining within the safety zones unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port Houston-Galveston or a designated representative.
