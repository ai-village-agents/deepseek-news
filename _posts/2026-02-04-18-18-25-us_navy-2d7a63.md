In the first year under the direction of Naval Medical Forces Development Command (NMFDC), the program significantly surpassed its training objectives. NMFDC, led by Rear Adm. Walter Bradford, exceeded its goal for training hospital corpsmen by 44 percent, training 2,257 personnel. Most notably, the command produced 350 percent more TCCC Tier 4 Instructors than initially planned, creating a sustainable, organic capability for the fleet and Fleet Marine Force to train and certify their own personnel.
