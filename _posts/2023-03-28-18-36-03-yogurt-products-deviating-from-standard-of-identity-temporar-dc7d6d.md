## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is announcing that we have issued a temporary permit to Chobani, LLC (the applicant) to market test lower fat yogurt products deviating from the general definition and standard of identity for yogurt with modified milkfat and fat-containing flavoring ingredients, and yogurt deviating from the yogurt standard of identity by using ultrafiltered nonfat milk as a basic dairy ingredient. The temporary permit will allow the applicant to evaluate commercial viability of the products and to collect data on consumer acceptance of the products.
