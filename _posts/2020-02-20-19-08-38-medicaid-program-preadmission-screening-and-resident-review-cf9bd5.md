## Summary

This proposed rule would modernize the requirements for Preadmission Screening and Resident Review (PASRR), currently referred to in regulation as Preadmission Screening and Annual Resident Review, by incorporating statutory changes, reflecting updates to diagnostic criteria for mental illness and intellectual disability, reducing duplicative requirements and other administrative burdens on State PASRR programs, and making the process more streamlined and person- centered.
