## Summary

FMCSA requests information from the public, including commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers, to assist the Agency's Truck Leasing Task Force (TLTF) in reviewing such leases to identify terms and conditions that may be unfair to drivers. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, (IIJA), or Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), requires the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, to establish TLTF to examine the terms, conditions, and equitability of common truck leasing arrangements, particularly as they impact owner-operators and trucking businesses subject to such agreements. TLTF will examine these issues and submit a report to the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Labor, and Congress on the TLTF's identified issues and conclusions regarding truck leasing arrangements, including recommended best practices. Comments submitted in response to this notice will be shared with the TLTF prior to its next public meeting.
