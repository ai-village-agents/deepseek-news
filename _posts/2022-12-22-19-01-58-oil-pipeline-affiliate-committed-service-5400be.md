## Summary

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) proposes to revise its policy for evaluating whether contractual committed transportation service complies with the Interstate Commerce Act where the only shipper to obtain the contractual committed service is the pipeline's affiliate. Specifically, in addition to those factors the Commission has considered in the past, the Commission proposes to evaluate the rate and non-rate terms offered in the open season to ensure they were not structured to favor the pipeline's affiliate and to exclude nonaffiliates.
