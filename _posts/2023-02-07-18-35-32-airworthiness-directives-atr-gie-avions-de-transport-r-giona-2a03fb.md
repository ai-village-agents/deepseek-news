## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-09- 13, which applied to certain ATR-GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42-500 airplanes. AD 2021-09-13 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. This AD was prompted by a determination that additional new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD retains the requirement of AD 2021-09-13. This AD also requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
