## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is providing notice of the availability of data on the administration of the assurance provisions of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) trading programs for the control periods in 2021. Total emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) reported by Missouri units participating in the CSAPR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Group 2 Trading Program during the 2021 control period exceeded the state's assurance level under the program. Data demonstrating the exceedance and EPA's final calculations of the amounts of additional allowances that the owners and operators of certain Missouri units must surrender have been posted in a spreadsheet on EPA's website.
