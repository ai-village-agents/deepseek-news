## Summary

We, NMFS, have completed a comprehensive status review for the sunflower sea star, Pycnopodia helianthoides, in response to a petition to list this species as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Based on the best scientific and commercial information available, including the draft status review report, and after taking into account efforts being made to protect the species, we have determined that the sunflower sea star is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout its range. Therefore, we propose to list the sunflower sea star as a threatened species under the ESA. Should the proposed listing be finalized, any protective regulations under section 4(d) of the ESA would be proposed in a separate Federal Register notice. We do not propose to designate critical habitat at this time because it is not currently determinable. We are soliciting information to inform our final listing determination, as well as the development of potential protective regulations and critical habitat designation.
