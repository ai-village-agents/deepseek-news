## Summary

The FAA is revising a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that would have applied to all MHI RJ Aviation ULC Model CL-600-2C10 (Regional Jet Series 700, 701 & 702) airplanes, Model CL-600-2C11 (Regional Jet Series 550) airplanes, Model CL-600-2D15 (Regional Jet Series 705) airplanes, Model CL-600-2D24 (Regional Jet Series 900) airplanes, and Model CL-600-2E25 (Regional Jet Series 1000) airplanes. This action revises the NPRM by proposing to require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate two aircraft maintenance manual (AMM) tasks. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive (AD) to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over those in the NPRM, the FAA is requesting comments on this SNPRM.
