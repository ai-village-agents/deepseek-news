## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to list the Sira curassow (Pauxi koepckeae) and southern helmeted curassow (Pauxi unicornis), two bird species from South America, as endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would add these species to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and extend the Act's protections to these species.
