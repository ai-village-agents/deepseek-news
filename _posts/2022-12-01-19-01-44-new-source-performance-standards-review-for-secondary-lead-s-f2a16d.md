## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing amendments to the Standards of Performance for secondary lead smelters per the Agency's periodic review of the new source performance standards required by the Clean Air Act (CAA). In this action, we are proposing updates to the current New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for secondary lead smelters and proposing a new NSPS subpart that applies to affected sources constructed, reconstructed, or modified after the date of this proposed rule. For the current NSPS subpart, we are proposing to revise the definitions of blast furnace, reverberatory furnace, and pot furnace to more closely align with the equipment definitions used in the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for secondary lead smelting. We are also proposing requirements for periodic performance tests for particulate matter (PM) and incorporating revised monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements, including electronic reporting of performance tests, to be more consistent with the NESHAP. For the new subpart, we are proposing updated PM and opacity emissions limits for blast, reverberatory, and pot furnaces that reflect the performance achieved by the best system for emissions reductions (BSER). In the new subpart, we are proposing PM and opacity emissions limits that apply at all times, including during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM), and proposing initial and periodic PM and opacity performance testing and the same equipment definitions, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements proposed for current NSPS subpart.
