## Summary

This action extends the comment period for a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that was published on March 20, 2025. In that document, the FAA proposed to establish restricted areas R-5305A, R-5305B, and R-5305C at Camp Lejeune, NC; and restricted areas R-5307A, R-5307B, and R-5307C at Cherry Point, NC. This extension is a result of a planned outage of the eRulemaking General Services Administration (GSA) Cloud Migration website necessitating an extension to the comment period.
