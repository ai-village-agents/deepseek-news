## Summary

The U.S. Copyright Office is issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the obligations of the mechanical licensing collective to report and distribute royalties paid by digital music providers under the blanket license to musical work copyright owners under title I of the Orrin G. Hatch-Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act. After soliciting public comments through a notification of inquiry, the Office is now proposing regulations establishing the timing, form, delivery, and certification of statements accompanying royalty distributions to musical work copyright owners. The Office solicits additional public comments on the proposed rule. This notice concerns only royalty statements and distributions regarding matched uses of musical works embodied in sound recordings and does not address issues related to the distribution of unclaimed, accrued royalties.
