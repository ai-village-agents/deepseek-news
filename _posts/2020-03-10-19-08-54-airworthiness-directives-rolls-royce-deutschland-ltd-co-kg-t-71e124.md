## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd. & Co KG (RRD) Trent 1000-AE3, Trent 1000- CE3, Trent 1000-D3, Trent 1000-G3, Trent 1000-H3, Trent 1000-J3, Trent 1000-K3, Trent 1000-L3, Trent 1000-M3, Trent 1000-N3, Trent 1000-P3, Trent 1000-Q3, and Trent 1000-R3 model turbofan engines. This AD requires initial and repetitive borescope inspections (BSI) of the high-pressure turbine (HPT) blades. This AD also requires replacement of HPT blades with parts eligible for installation when the HPT blades fail inspection or reach the new life limit. This AD was prompted by the manufacturer identifying that the HPT blades may fail prematurely. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
