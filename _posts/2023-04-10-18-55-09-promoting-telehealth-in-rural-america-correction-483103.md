## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (Commission) is correcting a final rule that appeared in the Federal Register on March 23, 2023. In the document, amendatory instruction 4 of the rules incorrectly removed the subparagraphs to paragraph (a) when paragraph (a) was revised. This correction is made to amend instruction 4 so that only paragraph (a) introductory text be revised and the subparagraphs remain in place.
