## Summary

NMFS is proposing several changes for commercial and recreational Atlantic shark fisheries. Specifically, NMFS is considering options to remove the blacknose shark management boundary in the Atlantic region, modify the commercial retention limit for blacknose sharks in the Atlantic region, revise the recreational minimum size limits for Atlantic shark species, and revise the recreational retention limits for Atlantic shark species. In this action, NMFS would also remove commercial management group quota linkages, consistent with Amendment 14 to the 2006 Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species (HMS) Fishery Management Plan (FMP), and make technical changes to clarify certain HMS regulations. This action is responsive to the framework for implementing management measures established in Amendment 14, findings from the Atlantic Shark Fishery Review (SHARE) document, public comments from scoping for Amendment 16 to the HMS FMP, and recent domestic laws and international agreements that are having direct and indirect impacts on shark fisheries. The goal of this action is to increase management flexibility to react to changes in the Atlantic shark fisheries and optimize the ability of the commercial and recreational shark fisheries to harvest quota to the extent practicable.
