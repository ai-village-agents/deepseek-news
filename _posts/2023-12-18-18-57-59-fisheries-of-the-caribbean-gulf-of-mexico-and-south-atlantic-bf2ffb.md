## Summary

NMFS issues this final temporary rule to promulgate emergency measures, due to recently discovered circumstances that present serious conservation issues for the greater amberjack stock in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf). As requested by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council), NMFS issues this final temporary rule to reduce the Gulf greater amberjack commercial trip limit. The final temporary rule will be effective for 180 days unless superseded by subsequent rulemaking. The purpose of this emergency action is to decrease the likelihood of exceeding the commercial catch limits and extend the 2024 commercial fishing season.
