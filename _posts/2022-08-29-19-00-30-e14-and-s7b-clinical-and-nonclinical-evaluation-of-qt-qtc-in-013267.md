## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled "E14 and S7B Clinical and Nonclinical Evaluation of QT/QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential--Questions and Answers." The guidance was prepared under the auspices of the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), formerly the International Conference on Harmonisation. The guidance contains revised questions and answers (Q&As) for the ICH guidance for industry "E14 Clinical Evaluation of the QT/QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs" and new Q&As for the ICH guidance for industry "S7B Nonclinical Evaluation of the Potential for Delayed Ventricular Repolarization (QT Interval Prolongation) by Human Pharmaceuticals" that provide recommendations on considerations for an integrated risk assessment combining nonclinical and clinical data--in particular, at later stages of drug development when clinical data are available. The guidance is intended to provide a harmonized approach to integrate nonclinical and clinical information for proarrhythmia risk assessment to streamline drug development and provide clarity on regulatory decision making. This guidance finalizes the draft guidance of the same title issued in September 2020.
