## Summary

HRSA is updating income levels used to identify a "low-income family" for the purpose of determining eligibility for programs that provide health professions and nursing training to individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. These various programs are authorized in Titles III, VII, and VIII of the Public Health Service Act. HHS periodically publishes in the Federal Register low-income levels to be used by institutions receiving grants or cooperative agreement awards to determine eligibility for programs providing training for (1) disadvantaged individuals, (2) individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, or (3) individuals from low-income families.
