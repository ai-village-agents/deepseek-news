## Summary

The Copyright Office is publishing a final rule establishing adjusted fees for its services. The adjusted fees will recover a significant portion of the costs to the Office of registering copyright claims and provide greater cost recovery for certain other services provided by the Office. The new fee schedule reflects some increased and decreased fees, as well as some fees that the Office determined did not require adjustment. For example, under the new fee structure, the online Standard Application registration fee will increase from $55 to $65; the fee to register a group of published or unpublished photographs, however, will remain at $55. In addition to fees for registration and recordation, this final rule establishes adjusted fees for special services and Licensing Division services.
