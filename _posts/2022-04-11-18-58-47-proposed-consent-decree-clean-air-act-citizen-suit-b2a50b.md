## Summary

In accordance with the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA or the Act), notice is given of a proposed consent decree in Sierra Club et al. v. Regan, No. 21-cv-6956 (N.D. Cal, September 8, 2021). On September 8, 2021, Plaintiffs Sierra Club, Environmental Integrity Project, and Natural Resources Defense Council (collectively, Plaintiffs) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Oakland Division. Plaintiffs alleged that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) failed to undertake certain non-discretionary duties in accordance with the Act to timely respond to numerous state implementation plan submissions and to issue findings of failure to submit to numerous other states who had failed to respond to an EPA finding that their state plans were substantially inadequate under the Act. The proposed consent decree would establish deadlines for EPA to act on certain submissions and establish that certain claims in the Complaint are now moot.
