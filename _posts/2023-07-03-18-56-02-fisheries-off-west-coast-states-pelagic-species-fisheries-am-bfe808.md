# Fisheries Off West Coast States; Pelagic Species Fisheries; Amendment 20 to the Coastal Pelagic Species Fishery Management Plan

## Summary

This final rule announces approval of and implements Amendment 20 to the Coastal Pelagic Species (CPS) Fishery Management Plan (FMP). Amendment 20 removes management category terminology from use in the FMP, but does not revise the manner in which the CPS stocks are managed. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) recommended Amendment 20 for clarity and consistency with other Council FMPs. This final rule removes the definition for "Actively Managed Species" and a reference to "monitored stocks" from Federal regulations. Because this action does not change the manner in which CPS stocks are managed, this action is administrative in nature.
