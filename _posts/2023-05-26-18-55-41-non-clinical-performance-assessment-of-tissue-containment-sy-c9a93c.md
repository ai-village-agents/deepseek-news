## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance entitled "Non-Clinical Performance Assessment of Tissue Containment Systems Used During Power Morcellation Procedures." This guidance document provides recommendations that may help manufacturers comply with the special controls related to non-clinical performance data for gynecologic and general laparoscopic power morcellation containment systems ("tissue containment systems"). Tissue containment systems are used to enable isolation and containment of tissue during a power morcellation procedure performed following a laparoscopic procedure for the excision of benign tissue that is not suspected to contain malignancy.
