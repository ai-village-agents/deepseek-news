## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") proposes to establish definitions, a test procedure, and sampling requirements for portable electric spas. Currently, portable electric spas are not subject to DOE test procedures or energy conservation standards. The proposed test method references the relevant industry test standard. DOE is seeking comment from interested parties on the proposals within the notice of proposed rulemaking ("NOPR").
