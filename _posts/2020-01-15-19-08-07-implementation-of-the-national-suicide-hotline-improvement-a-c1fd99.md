## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission proposes to designate 988 as a simple, easy-to-remember, 3-digit dialing code for a national suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline. We propose that all telecommunications carriers and interconnected VoIP providers be required to implement 988 in their networks within 18 months. We seek comment on these proposals and related issues, such as technical barriers to implementation and costs.
