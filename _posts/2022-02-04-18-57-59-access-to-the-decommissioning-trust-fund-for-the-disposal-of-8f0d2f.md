## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is denying a petition for rulemaking, dated February 22, 2019, submitted by Gerard P. Van Noordennen on behalf of EnergySolutions, LLC (the petitioner). The petition was docketed by the NRC on March 20, 2019, and was assigned Docket No. PRM-50-119. The petition requested that the NRC revise its regulations to allow access to the decommissioning trust fund for the removal of major radioactive components before the permanent cessation of operations and revise the definition of Decommissioning. The NRC is denying the petition because the petitioner does not raise a significant safety or security concern, and this subject area is adequately covered by existing regulations. The NRC's current regulations and oversight activities continue to provide for the reasonable assurance of adequate protection of public health and safety.
