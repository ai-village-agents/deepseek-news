## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain BRP-Rotax GmbH & Co KG (Rotax) Model 912 iSc2 Sport, 912 iSc3 Sport, 915 iSc2 C24, and 915 iSc3 C24 engines. This AD was prompted by a report of deviations during the manufacturing process that caused incorrect application of a certain thread-locker to certain sprag clutch housing and oil spray nozzles. This AD requires repetitive operational checks of the battery backup function with removal of the engine from service if insufficient battery power is found, one-time inspections of the oil spray nozzle and generator stator assembly, and, depending on the results of the inspections, replacement with parts eligible for installation. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
