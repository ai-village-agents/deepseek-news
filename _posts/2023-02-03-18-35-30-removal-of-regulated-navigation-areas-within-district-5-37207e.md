## Summary

The Coast Guard is updating District 5 regulations to remove two regulated navigation areas in Captain of the Port Zone (COTP) North Carolina within District 5 that are no longer needed. These areas were created to address the impacts of extreme shoaling in the Oregon Inlet, but subsequent Army Corps of Engineers dredging activities have alleviated the issue. The Coast Guard is removing these regulated navigation areas (RNAs) from the CFR to prevent confusion and to make the regulations easy to use.
