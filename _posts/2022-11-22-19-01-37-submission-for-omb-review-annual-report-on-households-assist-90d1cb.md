## Summary

OCS, Division of Energy Assistance, is requesting a substantial change of the Household Report Office of Management and Budget (OMB) #0970-0060, expiration May 31, 2025). Grant recipients complete the Household Report on an annual basis, completing either the Long Form or the Short Form version of the report. Submission of the completed report is one requirement for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) grant recipients applying for Federal LIHEAP block grant funds. OCS proposes substantive changes, including the addition of reporting requirements for assisted applicants and household member demographic characteristics on the Household Report Long Form and Short Form, and the removal of reporting requirements collecting counts of applicant households by assistance type and poverty interval on the Household Report Long Form.
