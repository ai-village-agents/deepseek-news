## Summary

The Maritime Administration (MARAD) requests applications from eligible candidates for possible participation in the Tanker Security Program (TSP). This request for applications is issued in accordance with certain provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21 NDAA) and the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 (FY22 NDAA). The FY21 NDAA authorized the Secretary of Transportation to establish a fleet of active, commercially viable, militarily useful, privately owned product tank vessels of the United States. The fleet will meet national defense and other security requirements and maintain a United States presence in international commercial shipping. The FY22 NDAA made minor adjustments related to the participation of long-term charters in the TSP. This request for applications provides, among other things, application criteria and a deadline for submitting applications for the enrollment of vessels in the TSP.
