## Summary

This action proposes special conditions for the Airbus A320- 200 Series Model -251N, -252N, -253N, -271N, -272N, -273N (known as A320neo) airplanes and A321-200 Series Model -251NX, -252NX, -253NX, - 271NX, -272NX (known as A321neo) airplanes. The airplanes will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport category airplanes. This design feature is flight attendant seats mounted on movable lavatory doors. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These proposed special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
