## Summary

This final rule removes the vaccine and testing requirements included in the Interim Final Rule with Comment Period (IFC) titled, "Vaccine and Mask Requirements To Mitigate the Spread of COVID-19 in Head Start Programs," which the Administration for Children and Families published on November 30, 2021. Specifically, this rescission removes the requirement from the Head Start Program Performance Standards (HSPPS) that all Head Start staff, contractors whose activities involve contact with or providing direct services to children and families, and volunteers working in classrooms or directly with children are fully vaccinated for COVID-19. The associated HSPPS requirement that staff who are exempt from the vaccination requirement have "at least weekly" COVID-19 testing is also removed.
