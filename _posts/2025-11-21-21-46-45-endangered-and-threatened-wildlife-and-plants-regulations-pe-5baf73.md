## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to revise our regulations concerning protections of threatened species under the Endangered Species Act (Act). We are proposing to remove the "blanket rule" option for protecting newly listed threatened species pursuant to section 4(d) of the Act. The Service intends to create species- specific rules for all threatened species currently protected under the "blanket rule" option. Until such species-specific rules are promulgated, threatened species that receive protections under the "blanket rule" option will continue to receive those protections.
