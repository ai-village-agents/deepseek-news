# Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Revisions

## Summary

This interim final rule revises HUD's regulation governing the Fair Housing Act's mandate that the Secretary administer HUD's program and activities in a manner that affirmatively furthers fair housing. This interim final rule returns to the original understanding of what the statutory AFFH certification was prior to 1994--a general commitment that grantees will take active steps to promote fair housing. Grantee AFFH certifications will be deemed sufficient provided they took any action during the relevant period rationally related to promoting fair housing, such as helping eliminate housing discrimination. This interim final rule does not, however, reinstate the obligation to conduct an Analysis of Impediments or mandate any specific fair housing planning mechanism; program participants must continue to affirmatively further fair housing as and to the extent required by the Fair Housing Act.
