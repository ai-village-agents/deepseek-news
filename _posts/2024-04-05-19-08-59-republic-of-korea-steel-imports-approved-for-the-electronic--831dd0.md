## Summary

This document announces that the export certification requirement for imports of steel products of the Republic of Korea that are subject to an absolute quota will be collected through the Electronic Certification System (eCERT). As a result, all imports of steel of the Republic of Korea that are subject to an absolute quota must have a valid export certificate with a corresponding eCERT transmission at the time of entry for consumption or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption. The transition to eCERT will not change the quota filing process or requirements.
