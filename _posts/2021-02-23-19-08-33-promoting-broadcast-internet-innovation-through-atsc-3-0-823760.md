## Summary

Through this final rule, the Commission fosters the efficient and robust use of broadcast spectrum capacity for the provision of Broadcast internet services consistent with statutory directives. In this document, the Commission concludes that ancillary and supplementary (A&S) fees should be calculated based on the gross revenue received by the broadcaster, without regard to the gross revenue of an unaffiliated third party, such as a spectrum lessee; should retain the existing standard of derogation of broadcast service, but amend the wording of the rules to eliminate the outdated reference to analog television; and should reaffirm that noncommercial educational television broadcast stations (NCEs) may offer Broadcast internet services. The Commission also reinterprets the application to permit noncommercial educational stations (NCEs) to devote the substantial majority of their spectrum not just to free over-the-air television but also ancillary and supplementary services; lowers the ancillary and supplementary service fee for certain NCE services; and clarifies that NCEs may offer limited Broadcast internet services to donors without transforming those donations into feeable ancillary and supplementary service revenue.
