## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing three temporary safety zones on the waters of the Delaware River, in portions of Marcus Hook Range, Anchorage 7, off Marcus Hook, PA, and Anchorage 9, near entrance to Mantua Creek. The safety zones temporarily restrict vessel traffic from transiting or anchoring in portions of the Delaware River while maintenance dredging is being conducted. The safety zones are needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from hazards created by dredging operations. Entry of vessels or persons into these zones is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the COTP or his designated representatives.
