## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve state implementation plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of Colorado to meet certain Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements related to the Denver Metro/North Front Range (DMNFR) area's classification as Marginal nonattainment for the 2015 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). The revisions contain a base year emissions inventory for the nonattainment area and certify that the State's existing Air Pollutant Emissions Notice (APEN) program fulfills the CAA's emission statement rule requirement. The revisions also include a new requirement for annual certification of APEN reported emissions. Unrelated to Colorado's Marginal ozone nonattainment obligations, EPA is also proposing to approve the State's revisions to Regulation 3 concerning an update to the date of incorporation by reference of global warming potentials used in the computation of the carbon dioxide equivalent for comparing emissions from various greenhouse gases (GHGs). EPA is taking this action pursuant to the CAA.
