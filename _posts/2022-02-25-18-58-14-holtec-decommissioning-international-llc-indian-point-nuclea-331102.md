## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing an exemption in response to a request dated November 19, 2021, from Holtec Decommissioning International, LLC (HDI), for Indian Point Nuclear Generating Station Units 1, 2, and 3 or Indian Point Energy Center (IPEC), from the requirement to investigate, trace, and report to the NRC any low-level radioactive waste shipment or part of a shipment for which acknowledgement of receipt is not received by HDI within 20 days after transfer from IPEC. HDI requested that this time period be extended from 20 to 45 days. HDI requested this change to avoid the administrative burden of investigating, tracing, and reporting on shipments that continue to be under requisite controls.
