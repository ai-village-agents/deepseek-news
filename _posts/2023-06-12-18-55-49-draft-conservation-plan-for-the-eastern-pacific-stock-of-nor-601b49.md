## Summary

The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) announces the availability for public comment the draft Conservation Plan for the Eastern Pacific Stock of Northern Fur Seal (Laaqudan) (Conservation Plan). The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) requires the Secretary of Commerce to develop a northern fur seal conservation plan for the purpose of conserving and restoring the species or stock to its optimum sustainable population. Accordingly, NMFS published its first conservation plan for the Pribilof Islands population in 1993 and a revised version in 2007. This current revision is required to include the latest research and management changes for the Eastern Pacific stock of northern fur seals (formerly the Pribilof Islands population).
