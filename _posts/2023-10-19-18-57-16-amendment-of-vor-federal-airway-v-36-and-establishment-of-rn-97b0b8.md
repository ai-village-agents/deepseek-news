## Summary

This action changes the effective date of a final rule published in the Federal Register on September 22, 2023, amending Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airway V-36 and establishing Canadian Area Navigation (RNAV) route T-675 in the northcentral United States (U.S.). The FAA is delaying the effective date to coincide with the expected completion of the associated aeronautical data requirements for establishing all segments of Canadian RNAV route T-675 within U.S. airspace and to adopt the rule amendments concurrently.
