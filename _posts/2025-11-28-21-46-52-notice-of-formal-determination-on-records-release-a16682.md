## Summary

The Civil Rights Cold Case Records Review Board previously reviewed and made formal disclosure determinations on records related to civil rights cold case incident 2024-003-041 in which the Department of Justice proposed postponements. The Department later proposed 6 additional postponements. On October 10, 2025, the Review Board determined that 63 pages in full and 43 pages in part produced by the Department of Justice should be publicly disclosed in the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection. By issuing this notice, the Review Board complies with the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018 that requires the Review Board to publish in the Federal Register its determinations on the disclosure or postponement of records in the Collection no more than 14 days after the date of its decision.
