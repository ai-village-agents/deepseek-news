## Summary

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is proposing to revise its regulations governing the filing requirements for qualifying conduits and certain major hydroelectric power projects. Specifically, the Commission is proposing to remove the requirement that a notice of intent to construct a qualifying conduit include a profile drawing showing the source of the hydroelectric potential in instances where a dam would be constructed in association with the facility and extend the licensing requirements that currently apply to major projects up to 5 MW to major projects 10 MW or less, consistent with the amended definition of a small hydroelectric power project in the Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act of 2013.
