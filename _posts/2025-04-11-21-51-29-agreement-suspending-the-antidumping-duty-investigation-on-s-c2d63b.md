## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) selected two respondents for individual examination, Azucarera San Jose De Abajo S.A. (San Jose) and Santa Rosalia de la Chontalpa, SA de CV, and its affiliates (Santa Rosalia; collectively, Grupo BSM). Commerce preliminarily determines there are no attributable sales to serve as a basis for review of whether San Jose complied with the certain terms of the Agreement Suspending the Antidumping Duty Investigation on Sugar from Mexico, as amended (AD Agreement) during the period of review (POR) from December 1, 2022, through November 30, 2023. We preliminarily determine that Grupo BSM, did not comply with the requirement to eliminate at least 85 percent of the dumping found in the investigation during the POR. Furthermore, we consider Grupo BSM's noncompliant behavior to be serious and in need of remediation, and we will implement certain steps to address its noncompliance. Finally, Commerce preliminarily determines that the AD Agreement met the applicable statutory requirements during the POR.
