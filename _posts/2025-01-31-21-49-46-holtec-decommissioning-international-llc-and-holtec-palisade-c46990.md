## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing for public comment a draft environmental assessment (EA) and draft finding of no significant impact (FONSI) evaluating the environmental impacts from proposed Federal actions related to reauthorizing power operations at the Palisades Nuclear Plant (Palisades). Specifically, the NRC is considering an exemption request, a license transfer request, and license amendment requests (LARs) to support reauthorizing power operation under the NRC license. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Loan Programs Office (LPO), is a cooperating agency on the draft EA. DOE LPO's proposed action is to provide Federal financial support (a loan guarantee) for refueling and resumption of power generation activities at Palisades.
