EPA is finalizing amendments to Crop Group 6: Legume Vegetables; Crop Group 7: Foliage of Legume Vegetables; Crop Group 15: Cereal Grains; and Crop Group 16: Forage, Fodder and Straw of Cereal Grains. EPA is also finalizing amendments to the associated commodity definitions. This is the sixth in a series of planned crop group updates expected to be prepared over the next several years.
