## Summary

This action corrects a final rule published by the FAA in the Federal Register on March 5, 2024, that amended Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal Airways V-78 and V-171 due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Darwin, MN (DWN), VOR/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) navigational aid (NAVAID). In the final rule, the V-171 description inadvertently included the airway segment between the Terre Haute, IN, VORTAC and the Peotone, IL, VORTAC, in error. That airway segment was removed from V-171, effective January 25, 2024, in a separate docket action when the VOR portion of the Danville, IL, VORTAC was decommissioned. This action corrects that error.
