## Summary

The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which amended Title XCIX of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (collectively, the CHIPS Act or Act) established an incentives program to reestablish and sustain U.S. leadership across the semiconductor supply chain. The Department of Commerce, through the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is issuing this final rule to implement conditions in the Act that seek to prevent funding provided through the program from being used to directly or indirectly benefit foreign countries of concern. The rule defines terms related to these conditions, describes the types of activities that are prohibited by those conditions, and sets forth procedures for notifying the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) of non-compliance and the process by which the Secretary will enforce these provisions.
