## Summary

On December 17, 2021, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") published a notice of proposed rulemaking ("NOPR") on potential amendments to its test procedure for electric motors. The NOPR provided an opportunity for submitting written comments, data, and information on the proposal by February 15, 2022. DOE received requests from the National Electrical Manufacturers Association ("NEMA") and the Hydraulic Institute ("HI") on January 25, 2022, and January 26, 2022, respectively, asking DOE to extend the public comment period for 30 additional days. DOE has reviewed these requests and is granting an extension of the public comment period to allow public comments to be submitted until February 28, 2022.
