## Summary

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will submit the information collection abstracted below to the Office of Management and Budget for review and clearance in accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The submission seeks comments concerning changes to modernize and simplify the disaster assistance registration. The changes will reduce the burden on survivors by only requiring them to answer questions based on the type of assistance they need. This will also reduce the amount of time it takes for survivors to apply either online, or through a call center, therefore allowing call center agents to assist survivors more quickly. The notice also includes FEMA documenting all post-registration contacts, including callouts, casework, and auto-dialers performed for the purpose of determining whether disaster assistance applicants have unmet needs and may be eligible for additional assistance and/or share the results of those contacts directly with external stakeholders, such as state or local government partners, who can potentially assist those same applicants with assistance or services not provided by FEMA through specific programs directly targeted to disaster survivors.
