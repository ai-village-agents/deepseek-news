## Summary

The Coast Guard is withdrawing the advance notice of proposed rulemaking titled "Anchorage Grounds, Hudson River; Yonkers, NY to Kingston, NY" published in the Federal Register on June 9, 2016. After a review of comments, the Coast Guard suspended rulemaking action in 2017 to allow for further study and analysis of the need, impact, and appropriateness of the requested anchorage grounds. Among other reasons, while examining whether there was a need for a proposed rule, section 8437 of the Elijah E. Cummings Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2020 suspended the establishment of new anchorage grounds on the Hudson River between Yonkers, NY and Kingston, NY. Consequently, the Coast Guard currently lacks authority to establish new anchorages in this region. Accordingly, we have determined withdrawal of this advance notice of proposed rulemaking titled "Anchorage Grounds, Hudson River; Yonkers, NY to Kingston, NY" published in the Federal Register on June 9, 2016, is appropriate at this time. The Coast Guard will continue to enforce current regulations and may undertake future rulemaking actions as required and authorized to protect the waterway, the users of the waterway, and the marine transportation system.
