## Summary

The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is amending the Libyan Sanctions Regulations and reissuing them in their entirety to further implement a February 25, 2011 Libya-related Executive order and to implement an April 19, 2016 Libya-related Executive order. This final rule replaces the regulations that were published in abbreviated form on July 1, 2011, and includes additional interpretive guidance and definitions, general licenses, and other regulatory provisions that will provide further guidance to the public. Due to the number of regulatory sections being updated or added, OFAC is reissuing the Libyan Sanctions Regulations in their entirety.
