## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A319-112, -115, and -132 airplanes; and Model A320-214, -216, -232, and -233 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that a possible interference was identified between 1M and 2M wiring harnesses and the tapping units, and that the interference could adversely affect the lavatory smoke detection system and/or the passenger oxygen system. This AD requires modifying the 1M and 2M harness routing, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
