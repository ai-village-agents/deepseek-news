## Summary

The Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily determines that imports of hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) components R-32 (difluoromethane), R-125 (pentafluoroethane), and R-143a (1,1,1- trifluoroethane) from the People's Republic of China (China) are circumventing the antidumping duty (AD) order on HFC blends from China. As a result, imports of R-32, R-125, and R-143a from China will be subject to suspension of liquidation effective June 18, 2019. We invite interested parties to comment on this preliminary determination.
