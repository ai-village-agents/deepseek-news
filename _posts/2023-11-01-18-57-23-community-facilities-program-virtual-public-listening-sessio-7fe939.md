## Summary

The Community Facilities Loan and Grant program (Community Facilities) of the Rural Housing Service (RHS or the Agency), a Rural Development agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), is consolidating the existing regulations that govern Community Facility direct loans and grants, fire and rescue and other small community facilities projects; as well as codifying the Tribal College Initiative, and Economic Impact Initiative grant programs that will incorporate all the necessary loan and grant making information into one streamlined final rule. The result will be an up-to-date comprehensive regulation that will be used to administer the programs. Community Facilities is hosting a virtual listening session to obtain stakeholder input on key proposed areas for changes and/or updates to the proposed consolidated Community Facilities Direct Loan and Grant regulation. This session is open to the public.
