## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily determines that imports of unthreaded pins of alloy steel from China are circumventing the antidumping duty (AD) order on alloy and certain carbon steel threaded rod from China and the countervailing duty (CVD) order on carbon and alloy steel threaded rod from China. We invite interested parties to comment on the preliminary determination.
