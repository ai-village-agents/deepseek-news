## Summary

Through this notice, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announces that the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) is extending the designation of Somalia for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 18 months, from March 18, 2020, through September 17, 2021. The extension allows currently eligible TPS beneficiaries to retain TPS through September 17, 2021, so long as they otherwise continue to meet the eligibility requirements for TPS. This notice also sets forth procedures necessary for nationals of Somalia (or aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in Somalia) to re-register for TPS and to apply for Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). USCIS will issue new EADs with a September 17, 2021, expiration date to eligible beneficiaries under Somalia's TPS designation who timely re-register and apply for EADs under this extension.
