## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing for public comment draft regulatory guide (DG), DG-1303, "Application and Testing of Safety-Related Diesel Generators in Nuclear Power." This draft guide is proposed revision 5 of Regularity Guide (RG) 1.9. DG- 1303 provides updated guidance that the staff of the NRC considers acceptable to demonstrate compliance with the NRC regulations for safety-related alternating current (AC) power supplies intended for use as onsite emergency power sources in nuclear power plants. This revision of RG 1.9 would endorse, with supplements and clarifications, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Std 387-2017, "IEEE Standard for Criteria for Diesel Generator Units Applied as Standby Power Supplies for Nuclear Power Generating Stations" and IEEE Std 2420-2019, "IEEE Standard for Combustion Turbine Generator Units Applied as Standby Power Supplies for Nuclear Power Generating Stations." This guidance would help ensure that the standby emergency power supplies are qualified, have sufficient capacity, and have the necessary reliability and availability for design-basis events.
