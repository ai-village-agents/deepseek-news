## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) brings the Commission's 800 MHz rebanding program to a conclusion, eliminates rules that are now unnecessary, and terminates this proceeding. The rebanding process is now essentially complete: Over 2,100 800 MHz licensees have successfully relocated to new channels in the band and the few licensing and administrative matters remaining can be completed outside the rebanding program.
