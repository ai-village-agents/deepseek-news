## Summary

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) is announcing that the Federal Reserve Banks (Reserve Banks) will expand the operating hours for the Fedwirer Funds Service to 22 hours per day, 6 days per week, operating Sunday through Friday, including weekday holidays (22x6).\1\ The Board is also announcing a corresponding expansion of the National Settlement Service's (NSS) operating hours to 21.5 hours per day, 6 days per week, operating Sunday through Friday, including weekday holidays, with NSS closing 30 minutes earlier than the Fedwire Funds Service. The Board expects the Reserve Banks to implement this expansion in 2028 or 2029 to ensure technological, operational, and industry readiness. The decision to expand operating hours is intended to support a wide range of payment activities, as well as the U.S. dollar's key role in global commerce and the international financial system. Further, the planned expansion to 22x6 operating hours will serve as an interim step and provide the necessary foundational capability for the Reserve Banks to expand operating hours up to 22x7x365 in the future. The Board will monitor industry demand and will stand ready to offer an additional expansion up to 22x7x365 no sooner than two years after the Reserve Banks implement 22x6 operations. If the Board does propose to expand operating hours beyond 22x6, it will seek public comment in a separate proposal. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
