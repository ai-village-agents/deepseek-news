## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to determine that the Allegheny County, Pennsylvania nonattainment area (NAA) has attained the 2012 annual fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF> or fine particulate matter) national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) by the December 31, 2021 attainment date applicable to Moderate NAAs. This determination is based upon quality- assured, quality-controlled, and certified ambient air monitoring data for the 2019-2021 period available in EPA's Air Quality Monitoring (AMS) database. The determination is based upon the three-year average of annual mean PM<INF>2.5</INF> concentrations for each eligible monitoring site being less than or equal to the level of the annual NAAQS of 12 micrograms per cubic meter ([micro]g/m\3\). This action is being taken under the Clean Air Act (CAA).
