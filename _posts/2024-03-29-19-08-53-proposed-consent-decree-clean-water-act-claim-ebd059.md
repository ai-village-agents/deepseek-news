## Summary

In accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator's March 18, 2022, memorandum regarding "Consent Decrees and Settlement Agreements to resolve Environmental Claims Against the Agency," notice is hereby given of a proposed consent decree in Sierra Club, et al. v. EPA, et al., No. 3:24-cv-00130 (S.D.W. Va. 2024). On March 18, 2024, the Sierra Club, the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy, Inc., and the West Virginia Rivers Coalition, Inc. (collectively, "Plaintiffs") filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia against EPA alleging that the Agency failed to perform a mandatory duty under the Clean Water Act (CWA) to establish Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) for certain waters located in the Lower Guyandotte River Watershed in West Virginia that are impaired due to ionic toxicity. This complaint followed Plaintiffs' submission to EPA of a Notice of Intent to Sue on March 21, 2023. EPA seeks public input on a proposed consent decree prior to its final decision-making with regard to potential settlement of the litigation.
