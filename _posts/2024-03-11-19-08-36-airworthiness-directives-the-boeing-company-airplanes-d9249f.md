# Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-8, 737-9, and 737-8200 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a non- conforming installation of spoiler wire bundles that led to unintended spoiler motion, including one instance of spoiler hardover. Further investigation identified the potential for a hardover of more than one flight spoiler on the same wing, which can exceed full lateral control capability leading to loss of control of the airplane. This proposed AD would require a one-time inspection of the clearance between the spoiler control wire bundles and the adjacent structure, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
