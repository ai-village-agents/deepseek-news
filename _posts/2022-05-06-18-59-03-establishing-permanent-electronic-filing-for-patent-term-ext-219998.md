## Summary

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO or Office) proposes to amend the Rules of Practice in Patent Cases to require that patent term extension (PTE) applications, interim PTE applications, and any related submissions to the USPTO be submitted electronically via the USPTO patent electronic filing system (EFS-Web or Patent Center). The proposed rule changes would reduce the administrative burden on PTE applicants. They also would further advance the USPTO's information technology (IT) strategy to achieve complete beginning-to-end electronic processing of patent-related submissions, thereby improving administrative efficiency by facilitating electronic file management, optimizing workflow processes, and reducing processing errors.
