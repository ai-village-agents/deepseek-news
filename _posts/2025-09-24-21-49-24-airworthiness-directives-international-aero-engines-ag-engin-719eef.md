## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain International Aero Engines AG (IAE AG) Model V2522-A5, V2524- A5, V2525-D5, V2527-A5, V2527E-A5, V2527M-A5, V2528-D5, V2530-A5, V2531-E5, and V2533-A5 engines. This AD was prompted by a manufacturer investigation that revealed a quality escape following angled ultrasonic inspections (AUSIs) performed on certain high-pressure turbine (HPT) 1st-stage hubs and HPT 2nd-stage hubs. This AD requires removal and replacement of certain HPT 1st-stage hubs and HPT 2nd-stage hubs. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
