## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of cracks found on the trunnion arms of the inboard flap assemblies. This AD requires repetitive inspections for cracking of the trunnion arms of the inboard flap assembly, and applicable corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also prohibits the installation of affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
