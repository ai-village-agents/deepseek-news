## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("Commission" or "CFTC") is announcing an opportunity for public comment on the proposed renewal of a collection of certain information by the agency. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act ("PRA"), Federal agencies are required to publish notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of information, including each proposed extension of an existing collection of information, and to allow 60 days for public comment. This notice solicits comments on the Commission's burden estimates associated with the requirements for swap dealers ("SDs") and major swap participants ("MSPs") to notify counterparties of their right to require segregation of initial margin, and to allow the counterparty to change that election by written notice to the SD or MSP, and to report quarterly to the counterparty that the back office procedures of the SD or MSP relating to margin and collateral requirements are in compliance with the agreement of the counterparties.
