## Summary

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) invites public comment on one currently-approved Information Collection Request (ICR), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number 1652-0056, abstracted below, that we will submit to OMB for an extension in compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected burden. The collection allows TSA to assess the current security practices in the pipeline industry through TSA's Pipeline Corporate Security Review (CSR) program and allows for the continuation of mandatory cybersecurity requirements under the TSA Security Directive (SD) Pipeline--2021-02 series.
