## Summary

On March 31, 2003, the National Science Foundation (NSF) issued a final rule that authorized the collection of meteorites in Antarctica for scientific purposes only. In addition, the regulations provide requirements for appropriate collection, handling, documentation, and curation of Antarctic meteorites to preserve their scientific value. These regulations implement the Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978, as amended by the Antarctic Science, Tourism and Conservation Act of 1996, and Article 7 of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. The NSF is required to publish notice of the availability of Meteorite Collection, Documentation, and Curation Plans received under the Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978. This is the required notice.
