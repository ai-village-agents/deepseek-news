## Summary

The Financial Stability Oversight Council (the "Council"), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, invites members of the public and affected agencies to comment on the continuing information collections listed below, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The Council is soliciting comments concerning its collection of information related to its authority to designate financial market utilities as systemically important. Section 804 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") provides the Council the authority to designate a financial market utility ("FMU") that the Council determines is or is likely to become systemically important because the failure of or a disruption to the functioning of the FMU could create, or increase, the risk of significant liquidity or credit problems spreading among financial institutions or markets and thereby threaten the stability of the United States financial system.
