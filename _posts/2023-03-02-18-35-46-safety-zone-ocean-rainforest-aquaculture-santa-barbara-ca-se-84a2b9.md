## Summary

The U.S. Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for the navigable waters, approximately 5 miles offshore of Santa Barbara, California. This safety zone is needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards created by ongoing aquaculture gear deployment and installation. Entry of persons or vessels into this safety zone is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port Sector Los Angeles--Long Beach (COTP), or their designated representative. The Coast Guard recently issued a safety zone for this area, but additional time is needed to complete the installation.
