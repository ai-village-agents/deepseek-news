## Summary

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) seeks comment on whether and how the required use of dynamic line ratings (DLR) is needed to ensure just and reasonable wholesale rates. The Commission further seeks comment on: Whether the lack of DLR requirements renders current wholesale rates unjust and unreasonable; potential criteria for DLR requirements; the benefits, costs, and challenges of implementing DLRs; the nature of potential DLR requirements; and potential timeframes for implementing DLR requirements.
