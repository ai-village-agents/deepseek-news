## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, Agency, or we) is announcing the availability of a final guidance entitled "Cybersecurity in Medical Devices: Refuse to Accept Policy for Cyber Devices and Related Systems Under section 524B of the FD&C Act of the FD&C Act." FDA generally intends not to issue "refuse to accept" (RTA) decisions for premarket submissions submitted for cyber devices based solely on information required by the new amendments to the FD&C Act for ensuring cybersecurity of devices before October 1, 2023, but instead, work collaboratively with sponsors of such premarket submissions as part of the interactive and/or deficiency review process.
