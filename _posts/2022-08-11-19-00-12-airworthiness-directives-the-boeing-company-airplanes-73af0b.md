## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-700, 737-800, 747-400, 747-8, 767- 400ER, and 777-200 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that there is the potential for electrical current to pass through low pressure (LP) oxygen flex-hoses in the gaseous passenger oxygen system. This AD requires replacing each conductive oxygen flex-hose installed on LP gaseous passenger oxygen systems with a serviceable non- conductive oxygen flex-hose. This AD also prohibits installation of a conductive oxygen flex-hose on LP gaseous passenger oxygen systems. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
