## Summary

NMFS has modified its Letter of Authorization (LOA) issued to the United States Navy (Navy) on July 7, 2022, for the taking of marine mammals incidental to training and testing activities conducted in the Point Mugu Sea Range (PMSR) study area and launch events from San Nicolas Island (SNI) over the course of seven years (2022-2029). Specifically, NMFS has removed certain reporting requirements related to explosives use, to be consistent with other LOAs issued for similar activities conducted by the Navy. The mitigation and mitigation related monitoring measures of the LOA remain unchanged, and the removal of these reporting measures do not change the findings made for the regulations or the original LOA or result in any change in the number of estimated or authorized takes.
