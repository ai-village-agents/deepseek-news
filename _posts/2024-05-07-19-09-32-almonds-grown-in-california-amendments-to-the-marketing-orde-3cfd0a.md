## Summary

This rulemaking amends Marketing Order No. 981, which regulates the handling of almonds grown in California. This final rule modifies the definition of almonds and shelled almonds, establishes a definition for "almond biomass," and changes dates when the Almond Board of California (Board) conducts elections to coincide with assessment collections and when the Board submits volume regulation recommendations to USDA. The amendments modify certain marketing order provisions to facilitate orderly administration of the program. Additionally, the amendments modernize, simplify, or align language with current industry practices and definitions.
