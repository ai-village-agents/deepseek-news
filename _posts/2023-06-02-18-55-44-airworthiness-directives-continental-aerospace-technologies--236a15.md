## Summary

The FAA is revising a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that applied to certain Continental Aerospace Technologies, Inc. (Continental) Model C-125, C145, GO-300, IO-360, IO-470, IO-520, IO- 550, O-300, O-470, TSIO-360, and TSIO-520 series engines with a certain oil filter adapter installed. The NPRM proposed to supersede AD 2022- 04-04. This action revises the NPRM by updating the applicability to include Continental model engines with certain oil filter adapters installed and updating the service information references. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive (AD) to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden by expanding the applicability, the agency is requesting comments on this SNPRM.
