## Summary

The National Credit Union Administration Board (Board) is issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking to codify the elimination of reputation risk from its supervisory program. Among other things, the proposed rule would prohibit the agency from criticizing or taking adverse action against an institution, defined as an entity for which the NCUA makes or will make supervisory determinations or other decisions, either solely or jointly on the basis of reputation risk. The proposed rule would also prohibit the agency from requiring, instructing, or encouraging an institution to close an account, to refrain from providing an account, product, or service, or to modify or terminate any product or service on the basis of a person or entity's political, social, cultural, or religious views or beliefs, constitutionally protected speech, or on the basis of politically disfavored but lawful business activities perceived to present reputation risk.
