## Summary

Pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, the Selective Service System (SSS) is issuing a public notice of its intent to create a Privacy Act System of Records titled, "Enterprise Content Management System". This System of Records notice (SORN) describes the platform that will manage the document workflow and processing automation of the SSS. The focus of the system is to enable document capture, OCR (where applicable), access, visibility and routing for status & completion, document archiving and destruction, and retrieval based upon the document type and workflow required. These data services include data file storage and processing as well as input from a variety of electronic and paper sources. The ECM includes hardware, software applications, data, communications, and personnel. This newly established system will be included in the SSS inventory of record systems.
