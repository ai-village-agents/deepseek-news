## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that the axis index washers on the forward and rear main landing gear door hinges were found inverted in production. This AD requires a one-time detailed inspection of the axis index washers for correct installation, and, depending on findings, replacement of the axis index washers, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
