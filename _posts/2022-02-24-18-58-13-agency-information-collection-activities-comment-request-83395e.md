## Summary

The Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, invites the general public and other Federal Agencies to comment on the proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. Government-wide policy requires all Federal employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19, with exceptions only as required by law. Employees may seek a legal exception to the vaccination requirement due to a disability, using the reasonable accommodation Form. The agency may also ask for other information, as needed. Requests for "medical accommodation" or "medical exceptions" will be treated as requests for a disability accommodation and evaluated and decided under applicable Rehabilitation Act standards for reasonable accommodation absent undue hardship to the agency.
