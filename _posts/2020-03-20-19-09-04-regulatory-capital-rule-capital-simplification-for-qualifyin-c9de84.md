## Summary

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is correcting an interagency final rule that appeared in the Federal Register on November 13, 2019, regarding the final rule titled "Regulatory Capital Rule: Capital Simplification for Qualifying Community Banking Organizations." These corrections are necessary to conform a footnote citation in the FDIC's amendment to its codified appendix for the Interagency Guidelines for Real Estate Lending Policies with the footnote citation in the regulations of the other federal banking agencies that issued that final rule.
