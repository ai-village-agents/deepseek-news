## Summary

The Rural-Business Cooperative Service (the Agency) announces the availability of two individual grants: One single $500,000 grant from the rural transportation funds appropriated for the Rural Business Development Grant (RBDG) program and another single $250,000 grant for Federally Recognized Native American Tribes (FRNATs) (collectively "Programs") from the funds appropriated for the RBDG program. Each grant is to be competitively awarded to an eligible applicant which is a qualified national non-profit organization. One grant is for the provision of technical assistance to rural transportation (RT) projects and the other grant will solely be for the provision of technical assistance to RT projects operated by FRNATs. All applicants are responsible for any expenses incurred in developing their applications.
