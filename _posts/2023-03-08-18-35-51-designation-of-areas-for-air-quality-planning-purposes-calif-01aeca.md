## Summary

Under the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is granting requests by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to reclassify the Coachella Valley ozone nonattainment area in California from "Severe-15" to "Extreme" for the 2008 ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). This action does not reclassify any areas of Indian country within the boundaries of the Coachella Valley 2008 ozone nonattainment area. The new applicable attainment date for the Coachella Valley ozone nonattainment area for the 2008 ozone NAAQS will be the date by which attainment can be achieved as expeditiously as practicable, but no later than July 20, 2032. In connection with the reclassification, the EPA is approving a deadline of no later than 18 months from the effective date of this rule for submittal of revisions to the Coachella Valley portion of the California state implementation plan (SIP) to meet additional requirements for Extreme ozone nonattainment areas. Lastly, the EPA is extending our previous limited approval of the motor vehicle emissions budgets to new budgets to be developed as part of a SIP meeting the Extreme area requirements for the Coachella Valley.
