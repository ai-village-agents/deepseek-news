## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to modify and reissue a current DHS system of records titled "Department of Homeland Security/Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-004 Non-Disaster Grant Management Information Files System Records." This system of records allows DHS/ FEMA to collect and maintain records from points of contact for state, local, tribal, territorial, and other entities applying for FEMA grant programs that are not disaster related. FEMA collects grant management information to determine eligibility for DHS grant awards for non- disaster grants and for the issuance of awarded funds. DHS/FEMA is updating this system of records to revise and add routine uses, as well as update the retention schedule. This updated system will be included in DHS's inventory of record systems.
