## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves information used to issue special flight authorizations for non-revenue transports and non-transport jet operations of Stage 2 airplanes at U.S. airports. Only a minimal amount of data is requested to identify the affected parties and determine whether the purpose for the flight is one of those enumerated by law. This collection is required under the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 (as amended by Pub. L. 106-113) and the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012.
