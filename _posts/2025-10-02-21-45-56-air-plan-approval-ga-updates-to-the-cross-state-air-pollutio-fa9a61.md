## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted through the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (GA EPD) on July 18, 2024, regarding updates to the State's Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) emissions trading programs. The SIP revision incorporates by reference (IBRs) certain amendments EPA has made to the regulations for the Federal CSAPR trading programs for annual emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) and sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) and NO<INF>X</INF> ozone season (from May 1 to September 30), all three of which apply to large electric generating units (EGUs). The SIP revision also updates the definition for "Volatile organic compound." EPA is approving Georgia's July 18, 2024, SIP revision because it is consistent with the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act).
