In accordance with the provisions of the Privacy Act, as amended, this notice announces a new matching program with the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE). Under this matching program, OCSE will provide SSA with quarterly wage (QW) and unemployment insurance (UI) information located in the National Directory of New Hires (NDNH) to allow SSA to determine eligibility of applicants for Extra Help (low-income subsidy assistance) under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003. This agreement assists SSA in determining eligibility of applicants for Extra Help, redetermining eligibility of existing Extra Help beneficiaries during periodic screening, and administering the Extra Help program.
