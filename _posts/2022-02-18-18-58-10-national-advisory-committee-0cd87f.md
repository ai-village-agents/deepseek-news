## Summary

The Census Bureau is giving notice of a virtual meeting of the National Advisory Committee (NAC). The Committee will address strategies for communicating the use of differential privacy for the 2020 Census data products. Additionally, the Committee will provide recommendations for messaging and communication strategies for information data users, of all skill levels, about what differential privacy is, the data protection it provides, the privacy/accuracy tradeoff, and the strengths and limitations of the 2020 Census data products. Last-minute changes to the schedule are possible, which could prevent giving advance public notice of schedule adjustments.
