## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA or Agency) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research's (CBER) Office of Therapeutic Products (OTP) and Center for Drug Evaluation and Research's (CDER) Office of New Drugs are announcing the opportunity for a limited number of development programs to participate in the Support for clinical Trials Advancing Rare disease Therapeutics (START) Pilot Program, with the goal of further accelerating the pace of development of certain CBER- and CDER-regulated products (novel drug and biological products) that are intended to treat a rare disease. Because each Center has identified specific needs concerning regulated products for rare diseases, the eligibility criteria for the pilot differ between CBER and CDER. This pilot would augment the currently available formal meetings between FDA and sponsors by addressing issues related to the development of individual products through more rapid, ad-hoc communication mechanisms. Sponsors, if selected for the pilot, would receive more frequent advice related to such specific issues through additional interactions to facilitate novel drug and biological product program development and generate high quality and reliable data intended to support a Biologics License Application (BLA) or New Drug Application (NDA). This notice outlines the eligibility criteria, what to submit in a request to participate in the pilot, selection criteria, process, and FDA-Sponsor interactions expected to occur for programs participating in the pilot.
