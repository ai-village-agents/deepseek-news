## Summary

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is announcing a series of fees to be collected by USCIS. Recently enacted legislation that provided for reconciliation pursuant to Title II of House Concurrent Resolution 14, titled HR-1, establishes specific fees for various immigration-related forms, benefits, statuses, petitions, applications, and requests administered by multiple government agencies. This notice announces the new fees that are administered by USCIS, a component of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), to whom those fees apply, when the new fees take effect, instructions on their payment, when and if the fees may be waived, and consequences of the failure to pay. This notice is intended to provide the information needed for the public to comply with the new law.
