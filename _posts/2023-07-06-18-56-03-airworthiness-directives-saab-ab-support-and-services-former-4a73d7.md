## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Saab AB, Support and Services Model SAAB 340B airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that the affected airplanes must not be operated at a maximum take-off weight (MTOW) above 29,000 pounds. This AD requires amending the applicable airplane flight manual (AFM) by incorporating a temporary revision (TR) to reduce the MTOW, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
