## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to amend an existing special local regulation for certain waters of the East Passage, Narragansett Bay, RI. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters near East Passage, Narragansett Bay, RI, during a sail boat race. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from entering the special local regulation unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Sector Southeastern New England or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
