## Summary

In this document, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (WTB or Bureau) adopts two final reimbursement claims submission deadlines by which eligible incumbents and other eligible stakeholders are required to submit any outstanding transition-related claims to the C- band Relocation Payment Clearinghouse (RPC) for processing as part of the ongoing transition of the 3.7-4.2 GHz band (C-band). On October 13, 2023, the Bureau issued a Public Notice seeking comment on certain proposals advanced by the RPC, AT&T, Verizon, and SES relating to the conclusion of the C-band transition reimbursement program and wind down of the RPC's operations. After review of the record, WTB adopts: February 5, 2024, as the submission deadline to the RPC for all reimbursement claims for costs incurred and paid by claimants as of December 31, 2023, including all lump sum election claims by incumbent earth station operators; and July 1, 2024, as the submission deadline to the RPC for all reimbursement claims for costs incurred and paid by claimants after December 31, 2023.
