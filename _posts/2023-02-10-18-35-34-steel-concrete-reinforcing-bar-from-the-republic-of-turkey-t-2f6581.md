## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) have determined that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) orders on steel concrete reinforcing bar (rebar) from the Republic of Turkey (Turkey), Taiwan, and Japan, and the countervailing duty (CVD) order on rebar from Turkey would likely lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping as well as net countervailable subsidies and materials injury to an industry in the United States. Therefore, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation of these AD and CVD orders.
