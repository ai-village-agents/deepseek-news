## Summary

This document announces the continuation of effectiveness of a Medicare interim final rule and the extension of the timeline for publication of the final rule. Section 1871(a)(3)(B) of the Social Security Act (the Act) specifies that a Medicare final rule must be published no later than 3 years after the publication date of the proposed or interim final rule, except under exceptional circumstances. In accordance with sections 1871(a)(3)(B) and 1871(a)(3)(C) of the Act, we are providing a notification of continuation for a Medicare interim final rule, announcing the different timeline on which we intend to publish the final rule, and explaining why we were unable to publish the final rule on the regular, required 3-year timeline.
