## Summary

The U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing amendments to the electronic reporting requirements for the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units (also known as the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS)). This proposed action would revise and streamline the electronic data reporting requirements of MATS and increase data transparency by requiring use of one electronic reporting system, instead of two separate systems, and provide enhanced access to MATS data. No new continuous monitoring requirements would be imposed by this proposed action; instead, this action would reduce reporting burden, increase MATS data flow and usage, make it easier for inspectors and auditors to assess compliance, and encourage wider use of continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) for MATS compliance. In addition, this proposed action would extend the current deadline for alternative electronic data submission via portable document format (PDF) files through December 31, 2023.
