## Summary

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, invites the general public to take this opportunity to comment on a currently approved collection with revisions. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice seeks comments concerning the applications for the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) program, the Fire Prevention and Safety (FP&S) Grants program, the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) Grants program, and the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program--COVID-19 Supplemental (AFG- S). These programs focus on enhancing the safety of the public and firefighters with respect to fire and fire-related hazards. The changes proposed will acknowledge the FEMA Grants Outcomes (FEMA GO) system as the new collection instrument for the AFG, AFG-S, SAFER, and FP&S programs. The individual forms will be combined into a question bank to allow the FEMA GO system to fully utilize its technology to simplify the process by reducing unnecessary questions.
