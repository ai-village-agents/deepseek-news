## Summary

The FAA is revising a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-20-05 and AD 2022-09-16, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A318 series; A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, -133, -151N, and -153N; A320 series; and A321 series airplanes. This action revises the NPRM by adding new and revised tasks and limitations that must be incorporated into the existing maintenance or inspection program. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over those in the NPRM, the FAA is reopening the comment period to allow the public the chance to comment on these changes.
