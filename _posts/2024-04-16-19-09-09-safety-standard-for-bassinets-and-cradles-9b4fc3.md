## Summary

In 2013, the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission or CPSC) published a safety standard for bassinets and cradles (bassinets/cradles). By statute, after promulgating a mandatory rule, the Commission must periodically review and revise rules for durable infant or toddler products to ensure that they provide the highest level of safety for such products that is feasible. Accordingly, this proposed rule (NPR) would revise the existing rule for bassinets/cradles to ensure that it addresses identified hazards and that these sleep products for young infants provide the highest level of safety feasible.
