# Importation of Live Dogs for Resale From Regions Where African Swine Fever Exists or Is Reasonably Believed to Exist

## Summary

We are proposing to amend the regulations to establish requirements regarding the importation of live dogs for resale, whether through retail or wholesale channels or fee-based adoption, from regions where African swine fever (ASF) exists or is reasonably believed to exist. These regulations are necessary because dogs imported from ASF-affected countries for resale purposes, along with bedding, represent a potential risk for the introduction of ASF into the United States. This action would address that risk.
