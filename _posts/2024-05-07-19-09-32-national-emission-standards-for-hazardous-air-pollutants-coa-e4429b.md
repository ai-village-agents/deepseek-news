# National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units Review of the Residual Risk and Technology Review

## Summary

This action finalizes amendments to the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) for the Coal- and Oil- Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units (EGUs) source category. These final amendments are the result of the EPA's review of the 2020 Residual Risk and Technology Review (RTR). The changes, which were proposed under the technology review in April 2023, include amending the filterable particulate matter (fPM) surrogate emission standard for non-mercury metal hazardous air pollutants (HAP) for existing coal- fired EGUs, the fPM emission standard compliance demonstration requirements, and the mercury (Hg) emission standard for lignite-fired EGUs. Additionally, the EPA is finalizing a change to the definition of "startup." The EPA did not propose, and is not finalizing, any changes to the 2020 Residual Risk Review.
