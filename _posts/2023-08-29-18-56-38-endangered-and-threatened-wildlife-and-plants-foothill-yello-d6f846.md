## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), determine endangered status for two distinct population segments (DPSs) and threatened status for two DPSs of the foothill yellow-legged frog (Rana boylii), a stream-dwelling amphibian from Oregon and California. After review of the best scientific and commercial information available, we have determined endangered status for the South Sierra and South Coast DPSs and threatened status for the North Feather and Central Coast DPSs of the foothill yellow-legged frog under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. This rule adds the four DPSs to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and extends the Act's protections to these DPSs. We also finalize rules under the authority of section 4(d) of the Act for the North Feather and Central Coast DPSs that provide measures that are necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation of these two DPSs. We have determined that designation of critical habitat for the four DPSs is not determinable at this time.
