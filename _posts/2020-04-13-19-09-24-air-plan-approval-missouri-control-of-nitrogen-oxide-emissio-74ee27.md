## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the State of Missouri for a regulation that establishes nitrogen oxide (NO<INF>X</INF>) control equipment and NO<INF>X</INF> emission levels for Portland cement kilns. This final action will amend the SIP to include adding incorporations by reference, including definitions specific to the rule, revising unnecessarily restrictive language, updating test methods, and making other administrative wording changes. The EPA's approval of these rule revisions is being done in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
