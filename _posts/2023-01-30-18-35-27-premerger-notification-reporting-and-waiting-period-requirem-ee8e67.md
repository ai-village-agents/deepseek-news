## Summary

The Federal Trade Commission ("Commission" or "FTC") is amending the Hart-Scott-Rodino ("HSR") Premerger Notification Rules ("Rules") that require the parties to certain mergers and acquisitions to file reports with the FTC and the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice ("the Assistant Attorney General") (together the "Antitrust Agencies" or "Agencies") and to wait a specified period of time before consummating such transactions. The Commission is amending the Rules to conform to the new filing fee tiers enacted by the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022 ("2022 Amendments"), contained within the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023.
