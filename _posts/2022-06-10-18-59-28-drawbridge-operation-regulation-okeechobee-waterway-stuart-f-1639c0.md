## Summary

The Coast Guard is seeking information and comments on proposing a change to the drawbridge operating regulations for the Florida East Coast (FEC) Railroad Bridge, mile 7.4, and the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge, mile 7.5, across the Okeechobee Waterway (OWW), at Stuart, Florida. In anticipation of passenger rail service across the FEC Railroad Bridge, the Coast Guard recognizes a change to the drawbridge operating schedules may be necessary to meet the reasonable needs of the maritime community and railway traffic. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
