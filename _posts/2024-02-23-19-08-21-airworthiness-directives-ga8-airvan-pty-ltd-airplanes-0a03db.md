## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain GA8 Airvan (Pty) Ltd Model GA8 and GA8-TC320 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of insufficient electrical bonding of the solenoid (relay) box assembly that could result in degraded performance, errors, or intermittent failures of equipment connected to electrical Bus 1, Bus 2, associated electrical control, and protective devices fitted within or attached to the solenoid box. This proposed AD would require inspecting for an existing wire connecting the relay box earth point to the ground power socket, and if one is not present, installing a mechanical connection. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
