## Summary

We, NMFS, announce a 90-day finding on a petition to list the bull kelp (Nereocystis luetkeana) as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and to designate critical habitat concurrent with the listing. We have reviewed the information presented in the petition as well as information readily available in our files and find that the petition does not present substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned actions may be warranted. Therefore, we are denying this petition.
