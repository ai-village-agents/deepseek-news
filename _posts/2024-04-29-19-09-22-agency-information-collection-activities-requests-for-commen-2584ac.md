## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for a new information collection.

The information to be collected will be used to and/or is necessary because satisfaction rating is a metric measured by the Adopt-a-School program for success.
