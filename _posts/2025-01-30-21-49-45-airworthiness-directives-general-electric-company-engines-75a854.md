# Airworthiness Directives; General Electric Company Engines

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain General Electric Company (GE) Model CF6-80E1A2, CF6-80E1A3, CF6-80E1A4, and CF6-80E1A4/B engines. This proposed AD was prompted by a manufacturer investigation that revealed certain high-pressure turbine (HPT) stage 1 and HPT stage 2 disks were manufactured from powder metal material suspected to contain iron inclusion. This proposed AD would require replacement of affected HPT stage 1 and HPT stage 2 disks with parts eligible for installation. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
