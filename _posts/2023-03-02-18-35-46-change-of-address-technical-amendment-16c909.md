## Summary

Before using an electronic signature in an electronic record required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency), a person must submit a letter of non-repudiation to FDA. Letters of non- repudiation are required to certify that a person's electronic signatures are intended to be the legally binding equivalent of traditional handwritten signatures. FDA is amending its regulations to update the address for submission of a certification in paper form and to provide an option for electronic submission. This amendment is to ensure accuracy and clarity in the Agency's regulations. This technical amendment is nonsubstantive.
