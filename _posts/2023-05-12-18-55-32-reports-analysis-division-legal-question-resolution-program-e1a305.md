## Summary

The Federal Election Commission ("Commission") adopted a program in 2011, which was last revised in 2019, providing for a means by which persons may have a legal question considered by the Commission earlier in both the report review process and the audit process. Because the Commission is separately adopting a new audit process, it is revising the policy for the legal question program to narrow its scope to encompass only legal questions arising from requests for corrective action made by the Commission's Reports Analysis Division.
