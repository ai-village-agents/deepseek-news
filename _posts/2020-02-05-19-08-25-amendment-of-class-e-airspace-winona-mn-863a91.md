## Summary

This action amends the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Winona Municipal Airport-Max Conrad Field, Winona, MN. This action is due to an airspace review caused by the decommissioning of the Winona VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) navigation aid, which provided navigation information for the instrument procedures at this airport. The geographic coordinates of the airport are also being updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
