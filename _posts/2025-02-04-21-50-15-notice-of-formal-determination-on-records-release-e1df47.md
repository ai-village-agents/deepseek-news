## Summary

The Civil Rights Cold Case Records Review Board received 201 pages of records from the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) related to four civil rights cold case incidents to which the Review Board assigned the unique identifiers 2024-003-032, 2024-003- 036, 2024-003-056, and 2024-003-059. NARA proposed seven (7) postponements of disclosure in records related to incident 2024-003- 059. NARA did not propose postponements in the other records. On January 24, 2025, the Review Board rejected the proposed postponements and determined that all 201 pages of records should be publicly disclosed in the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection. By issuing this notice, the Review Board complies with section 7(c)(4) of the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018 that requires the Review Board to publish in the Federal Register its determinations on the disclosure or postponement of records in the Collection no more than 14 days after the date of its decision.
