## Summary

The Department previously issued several temporary individual prohibited transaction exemptions (PTEs) that allow certain asset managers related to UBS and CSAG (the UBS QPAMs, CS Affiliated QPAMs, and the CS Related QPAMs, as further defined below) to continue to rely on the exemptive relief provided by Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (PTE) 84-14, notwithstanding five judgments of convictions involving entities within the UBS and CSAG corporate umbrellas, as described below (the Convictions). The most recent individual exemptions are PTE 2020-01 (for UBS) and PTE 2022-01 for (CSAG). Those individual exemptions will no longer be available following the upcoming merger between CSAG and UBS (the Merger). This exemption would allow the UBS QPAMs, CS Affiliated QPAMs and the CS Related QPAMs to continue to rely on PTE 84-14 as of the date of the Merger if certain conditions are met. As described below, this individual exemption is necessary to preserve the ability of the QPAMs to engage in the transactions permitted by PTE 84-14, which would be lost due solely to the impending merger of UBS and Credit Suisse (and not because of a new conviction for either UBS or Credit Suisse or their affiliates). If granted, the exemption will be for one year. This limited duration reflects the lack of information before the Department regarding the effects the Merger will have on the UBS QPAMs and CS Affiliated and Related QPAMs.
