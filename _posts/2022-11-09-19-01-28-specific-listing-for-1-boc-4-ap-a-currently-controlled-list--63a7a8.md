## Summary

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is establishing a specific listing and DEA Chemical Control Number for tert-butyl 4- (phenylamino)piperidine-1-carboxylate (also known as 1-boc-4-AP; and CAS Number: 125541-22-2) and its salts as a list I chemical under the Controlled Substances Act. Although 1-boc-4-AP is not specifically listed as a list I chemical of the Controlled Substances Act with its own unique Chemical Control Number, it has been regulated as a list I chemical in the United States since May 15, 2020, as a carbamate of N- phenylpiperidin-4-amine, a list I chemical. Therefore, DEA is simply amending the list I chemicals list in its regulations to include a separate listing for 1-boc-4-AP, a currently controlled list I chemical.
