## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2024-06-02, which applies to all GE Aviation Czech s.r.o. (GEAC) Model M601D-11, M601E-11, M601E-11A, M601E-11AS, M601E-11S, and M601F engines. AD 2024-06-02 was prompted by a report of a crack on the centrifugal compressor case mount pad weld area caused by a non- conforming weld (lack of welding penetration). AD 2024-06-02 requires a one-time detailed visual inspection (DVI) of the compressor case pad welds for any crack, and replacement of the compressor case if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2024-06-02, the manufacturer determined that the compliance time for the DVI can be extended, and repetitive inspections of the centrifugal compressor case must be accomplished. This proposed AD would require performing repetitive DVIs of the compressor case pad welds for any crack, replacing the compressor case if necessary, and sending certain inspection results to the manufacturer, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
