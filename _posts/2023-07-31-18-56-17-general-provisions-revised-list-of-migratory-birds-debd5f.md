## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), revise the List of Birds protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) by both adding and removing species and changing names to conform to accepted use by the scientific community. Reasons for the changes to the list include adding species based on new taxonomy and new evidence of natural occurrence in the United States or U.S. territories, removing species no longer known to occur within the United States or U.S. territories, and changing names to reflect currently accepted taxonomy and nomenclature. The net increase of 13 species (16 added and 3 removed) brings the total number of species protected by the MBTA to 1,106. We also revise the scientific name of a species subject to specific migratory-bird-permit regulations and revise corresponding entries for several migratory bird species that are also listed on the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife under the Endangered Species Act to reflect currently accepted taxonomy and nomenclature. We are taking this action because an accurate and up-to-date list of species protected by the MBTA is essential for public-notification, regulatory, and law-enforcement purposes and to ensure consistency in the use of common and scientific names across Service regulations.
