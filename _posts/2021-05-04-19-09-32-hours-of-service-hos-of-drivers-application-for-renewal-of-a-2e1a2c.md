## Summary

FMCSA announces that it has received applications from the American Pyrotechnics Association (APA) requesting renewal of exemptions from certain hours of service (HOS) regulations that expired on July 8, 2020. The requests are being made on behalf of 60 APA member companies. The exemption requests would allow drivers for its members to exclude off-duty and sleeper berth time of any length from the calculation of the 14-hour limit and to use paper records of duty status (RODS) in lieu of electronic logging devices (ELD) during the designated Independence Day periods. The requests are for the transportation of pyrotechnics from June 28 through July 8 of every year from 2021 through 2025.
