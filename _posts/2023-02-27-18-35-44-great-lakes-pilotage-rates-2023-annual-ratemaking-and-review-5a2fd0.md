## Summary

In accordance with the statutory provisions enacted by the Great Lakes Pilotage Act of 1960, the Coast Guard is issuing new base pilotage rates for the 2023 shipping season. This rule adjusts the pilotage rates to account for changes in district operating expenses, an increase in the number of pilots, and anticipated inflation. These changes, when combined, result in a 16-percent net increase in pilotage costs compared to the 2022 season.
