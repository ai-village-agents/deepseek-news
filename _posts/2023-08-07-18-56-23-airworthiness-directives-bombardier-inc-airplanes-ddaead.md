## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-12- 20, which applied to certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-2B16 (604 Variant) airplanes. AD 2023-12-20 required replacing certain oxygen system hoses and prohibited installing affected oxygen hoses. Since the FAA issued AD 2023-12-20, the FAA has learned of an error in a required compliance time. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2023-12-20, with a revised compliance time for the replacement. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
