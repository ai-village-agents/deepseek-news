## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-100-1A10 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that the design of the spoiler control system causes certain engine indication and crew alerting system (EICAS) messages to be posted intermittently and repetitively during flight and on the ground, and flightcrews must action the appropriate checklist each time these messages appear. This AD requires revising the Non-Normal Procedures section of the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) associated with the spoiler electronic control unit (SECU) EICAS messages. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
