## Summary

SBA is amending the Privacy Act Systems of Records for the Loan System, SBA 21 ("SOR 21") to clarify that certain persons who have previously defaulted on a Federal loan or Federally-assisted financing resulting in the Federal government sustaining a loss are included in the records that SBA transfers to the Department of Housing and Urban Development for publication in a government-wide computer information system, the Credit Alert Verification Reporting System (previously referred to as the Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System). This notice is in accordance with the Privacy Act requirement that agencies publish their amended Systems of Records in the Federal Register when there is a revision, change or addition to the systems.
