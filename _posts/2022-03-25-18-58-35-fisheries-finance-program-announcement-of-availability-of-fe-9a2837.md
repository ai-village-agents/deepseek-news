## Summary

NMFS announces the availability of long-term direct loans for Western Alaskan Community Development Quota (CDQ) groups through the Community Development Loan program as a component of the Fisheries Finance Program (FFP). The Community Development loans will provide financing for the purchase of all or part of ownership interests in fishing or processing vessels, shoreside fish processing facilities, permits, quota, and cooperative rights in any of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Island fisheries. FFP loans are not issued for purposes that could contribute to over-fishing.
