## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to promulgate new methods and update the tables of approved methods for the Clean Water Act. The Clean Water Act requires the EPA to promulgate test procedures for the analysis of pollutants. Promulgating new methods and updating the tables of approved methods increases the quality and consistency of data collected for the purposes of the Clean Water Act. In this rule, the EPA proposes to add new EPA methods for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, and add methods previously published by voluntary consensus bodies that industries and municipalities would use for reporting under the EPA's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit program. The EPA also proposes to withdraw the seven Aroclor (PCB mixtures) parameters. In addition, the EPA is proposing to simplify the sampling requirements for two volatile organic compounds, and make a series of minor corrections to existing tables of approved methods. This proposed rule does not mandate when a parameter must be monitored or establish a discharge limit.
