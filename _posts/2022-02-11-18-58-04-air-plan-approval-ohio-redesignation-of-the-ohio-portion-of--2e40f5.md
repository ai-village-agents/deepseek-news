## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to find that the Cincinnati, Ohio-Kentucky area (Area) is attaining the 2015 8- hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS or standard) and to approve a request from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) to redesignate the Ohio portion of the Area to attainment for the 2015 ozone NAAQS because the request meets the statutory requirements for redesignation under the Clean Air Act (CAA). The Area includes Butler, Clermont, Hamilton, and Warren Counties in Ohio and Boone, Campbell, and Kenton Counties in Kentucky. OEPA submitted this request on December 21, 2021. EPA is also proposing to approve, as a revision to the Ohio State Implementation Plan (SIP), the state's plan for maintaining the 2015 8-hour ozone standard through 2035 in the Area. Finally, EPA is proposing to approve the state's 2026 and 2035 volatile organic compound (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) Motor Vehicle Emission Budgets (MVEBs) for the Ohio portion of the Area.
