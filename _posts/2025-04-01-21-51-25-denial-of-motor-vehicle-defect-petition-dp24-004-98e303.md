## Summary

This notice sets forth the reasons for the denial of a petition submitted to NHTSA on July 3, 2024, by Eric Hein, Director of the Institute for Safer Trucking (petitioner), requesting that the agency commence an investigation of all van-type (also known as box) semi-trailers due to collisions with passenger vehicles and vulnerable road users (pedestrians, bicyclists, or motorcyclists) resulting in significant injuries or death due to a lack of effective side underride guards (SUGs). On August 26, 2024, NHTSA opened Defect Petition DP24- 004 to evaluate the petitioner's request. After consideration of the petition, NHTSA believes that the issues raised here are best addressed through its recent rulemaking and the ongoing actions under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). Accordingly, the agency has denied the petition.
