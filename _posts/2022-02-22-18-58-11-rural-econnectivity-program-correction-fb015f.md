## Summary

The Rural Utilities Service (RUS) published a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) and solicitation of applications in the Federal Register on October 25, 2021, entitled Rural eConnectivity Program (ReConnect Program), announcing its general policy and application procedures for funding under the ReConnect Program established pursuant to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (which became law on February 15, 2019) which provides loans, grants, and loan/grant combinations to facilitate broadband deployment in rural areas. The purpose of this notice is to inform the public of changes made to the ReConnect program and to correct the October notice. The two changes are extending the application window until 11:59 a.m.. Eastern on March 9, 2022 and potentially increasing total level of funding.
