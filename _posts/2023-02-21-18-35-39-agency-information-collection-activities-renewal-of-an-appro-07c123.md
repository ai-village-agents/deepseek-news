## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FMCSA announces its plan to submit the Information Collection Request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval. The FMCSA requests to renew an ICR titled, "Commercial Driver's License Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse." The Agency's final rule, published December 5, 2016, titled "Commercial Driver's License Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse" (Clearinghouse) established the regulatory requirements for the Clearinghouse. The compliance date of the final rule was January 6, 2020. FMCSA began collecting data as authorized users began registering in the Clearinghouse in September 2019. This ICR renewal is needed to support the continuation of the querying and reporting requirements to address the problem of commercial driver's license (CDL) and commercial learner's permit (CLP) holders who test positive for the use of controlled substances or the misuse of alcohol and then continue to perform safety sensitive functions, including driving a commercial motor vehicle (CMV), without completing the required return-to-duty (RTD) process.
