## Summary

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its findings for the noise compatibility program submitted by LGA, see supplementary information for details. On July 6, 2022 the FAA determined that the revised noise exposure maps submitted by LGA were in compliance with applicable requirements and that the noise compatibility program would be initiating final review for approval or disapproval. On December 15, 2022, the FAA approved the LGA noise compatibility program. The noise compatibility program contained 23 recommended measures, including eight noise abatement measures, three land use measures, and 12 program management measures. Of the measures proposed, 14 were approved, five were approved as voluntary, three were disapproved, and one was determined to have no FAA action. Five of the eight noise abatement procedures proposed at LGA are related to new or revised flight procedures.
