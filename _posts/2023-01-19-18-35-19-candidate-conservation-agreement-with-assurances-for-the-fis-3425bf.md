## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), received two enhancement of survival permit (permit) applications pursuant to the Endangered Species Act (ESA). If granted, the requested permits would authorize take of the fisher (Pekania pennanti), incidental to otherwise lawful activities, if the species becomes federally listed under the ESA. These applications are associated with a template candidate conservation agreement with assurances (CCAA) developed by the Service for the conservation of the fisher. We have also prepared draft environmental action statements documenting our preliminary determination that the permit decisions may be eligible for categorical exclusion under the National Environmental Policy Act. We provide this notice to open a public comment period and invite comments from all interested parties.
