## Summary

This action amends the time of designation for restricted areas R-3008A, R-3008B, R-3008C, and R-3008D; Grand Bay Weapons Range, GA, by expanding the timeframe during which the areas may be activated without prior issuance of a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM). The expansion of the published designated times for these restricted areas reflects their routine actual use. This change better informs the flying public of actual routine use periods of the restricted areas and reduces NOTAM System workload.
