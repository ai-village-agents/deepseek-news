Fort Hunter Liggett’s 85-year legacy of training and service is reflected not only in its mission readiness but also in the landmarks that honor Soldiers who served and sacrificed for the nation. From Schoonover Airstrip, named for Medal of Honor recipient U.S. Army Cpl. Dan D. Schoonover, to the Weaver Monument and the 91st Training Division building honoring Master Sgt. Robb G. Needham, the installation preserves the stories of courage, dedication and sacrifice across generations. These sites serve as lasting reminders of the Soldiers whose service continues to inspire those who train at Fort Hunter Liggett today.
