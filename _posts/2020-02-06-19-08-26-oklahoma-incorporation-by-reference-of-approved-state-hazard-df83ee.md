## Summary

This rule codifies in the regulations the prior approval of Oklahoma's hazardous waste management program and incorporates by reference authorized provisions of the State's statutes and regulations. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) uses the regulations entitled "Approved State Hazardous Waste Management Programs" to provide notice of the authorization status of State programs and to incorporate by reference those provisions of the State statutes and regulations that are authorized and that EPA will enforce under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, commonly referred to as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The EPA previously provided notifications and opportunity for comments on the Agency's decisions to authorize the State of Oklahoma program and the EPA is not now reopening the decisions, nor requesting comments, on the Oklahoma authorizations as previously published in the Federal Register documents specified in Section I.C of this final rule document.
