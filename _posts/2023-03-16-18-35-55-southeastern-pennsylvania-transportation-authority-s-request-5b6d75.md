## Summary

This document provides the public with notice that, on February 22, 2023, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) submitted a request for amendment (RFA) to its FRA- approved Positive Train Control Implementation Plan (PTCIP). The RFA includes a petition seeking approval to discontinue or modify a signal system. On August 17, 2022, FRA approved, in part, SEPTA's RFA to its PTCIP; however, FRA did not provide a decision on SEPTA's request to discontinue or modify a portion of its signal system at that time as FRA must seek public comment on that aspect before issuing a decision.
