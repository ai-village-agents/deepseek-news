The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is announcing a two- day hybrid (in-person and virtual) conference with industry and other experts from academia on Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology (hereinafter, the BCI conference). This document describes the purpose and scope of the BCI conference and the procedures for attending or requesting to speak. In an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) published on October 26, 2021, BIS requested input from the public and industry concerning the potential uses of BCI technology, particularly with respect to its impact on U.S. national security. While the comments submitted in response to the ANPRM increased BIS's understanding of BCI technology, the BCI conference is intended to further both BIS's and the public's understanding of the current status of BCI technology and anticipated future developments in research and applications.
