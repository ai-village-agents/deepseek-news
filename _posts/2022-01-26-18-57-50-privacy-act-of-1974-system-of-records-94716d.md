## Summary

Veterans Information Solution (VIS) is an intranet web-based application that provides a consolidated view of comprehensive eligibility utilization data from across the Veterans Benefit Administration (VBA) and Department of Defense (DoD). VIS provides access to Veteran/Service Member profile, service, rating and award information, Medals and Awards, benefits payments data and other miscellaneous information. VIS is an active application but does not store data and all the systems from which data is retrieved are covered by system of records notices (SORNs). Therefore, there is no need for VIS to have a SORN.
