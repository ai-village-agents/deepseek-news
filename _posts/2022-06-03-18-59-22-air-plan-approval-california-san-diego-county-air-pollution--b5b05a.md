## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the San Diego County Air Pollution Control District's (SDCAPCD or District) portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). This revision concerns a volatile organic compound (VOC) rule covering transfer of organic compounds into mobile transport trucks and a negative declaration for non-Control Techniques Guidelines (CTG) major VOC sources. We are proposing to approve the local rule to regulate these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act) and the negative declaration. We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action. Elsewhere in this Federal Register, we are making an interim final determination to defer CAA sanctions associated with our previous disapproval action concerning the CTG categories addressed by the rule and negative declaration.
