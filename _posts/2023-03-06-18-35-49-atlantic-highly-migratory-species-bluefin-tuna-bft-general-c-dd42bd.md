## Summary

NMFS is proposing to set Atlantic BFT General category RFDs for parts of the 2023 and 2024 fishing years. Specifically, when the General category fishery is open, this proposed rule would set RFDs for every Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday from July 1, 2023 through November 30, 2023 and every Tuesday and Friday from December 1, 2023 through March 31, 2024. On an RFD, Atlantic Tunas General category permitted vessels may not fish for (including catch-and-release or tag-and- release fishing), possess, retain, land, or sell BFT. On an RFD, Highly Migratory Species (HMS) Charter/Headboat permitted vessels with a commercial sale endorsement also are subject to these restrictions that preclude fishing commercially for BFT under the General category restrictions and retention limits, but such vessels may still fish for, possess, retain, or land BFT when fishing recreationally under applicable HMS Angling category rules.
