## Summary

The Rural Utilities Service (RUS), an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), announces the solicitation of applications under the Guarantees for Bonds and Notes Issued for Utility Infrastructure Purposes Program (the 313A Program) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2022. The agency has received $750 million for this purpose in previous years and has a pro-rata share of that amount pursuant to the most recent continuing resolution. The final amount of funding shall be determined by Congressional appropriations. Should additional funding become available this fiscal year, RUS reserves the right to increase the total funds available under this notice. These types of loan guarantees will be made available to qualified applicants to make utility infrastructure loans or to refinance bonds or notes issued for such purposes. This notice is being issued in order to allow applicants sufficient time to leverage financing, prepare and submit their applications, and give the Agency time to process applications within FY 2022. An announcement will be made on the Agency website: https:// www.rd.usda.gov/newsroom/notices-solicitation-applications-nosas regarding any amount received in the FY 2022 appropriations. Successful applications will be selected by the Agency for funding and subsequently awarded. All applicants are responsible for any expenses incurred in developing their applications. The agency welcomes financially feasible proposals which would use funds available under this notice to further finance eligible utilities projects that demonstrably reduce carbon emissions.
