The Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily determines that the signatory, the Government of Mexico (GOM), and the respondent companies selected for individual examination, respectively, Impulsora Azucarera Del Tropico, S.A. de C.V. (Impulsora Del Tropico) and its affiliate and Ingenio Huixtla SA de C.V. (Ingenio Huixtla) and its affiliates are in compliance with the Agreement Suspending the Countervailing Duty Investigation on Sugar from Mexico, as amended (CVD Agreement), except for certain instances of inconsequential non- compliance.

However, Commerce intends to address certain issues identified in this review by discussing these issues with the GOM and Mexican producers/exporters, as appropriate.
