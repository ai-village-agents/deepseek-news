## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled "Pediatric Drug Development: Regulatory Considerations--Complying With the Pediatric Research Equity Act and Qualifying for Pediatric Exclusivity Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act." This draft guidance, when finalized, is intended to provide recommendations to industry on complying with the pediatric study requirements under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), and to describe the process for qualifying for pediatric exclusivity and the protections that pediatric exclusivity offers under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA). Combining discussion of PREA and the BPCA together in regulatory guidance emphasizes the sponsor's need to consider both laws when developing pediatric drugs and biological products.
