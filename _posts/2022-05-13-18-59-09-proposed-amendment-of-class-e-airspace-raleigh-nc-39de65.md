## Summary

This action proposes to amend Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Raleigh-Durham International Airport, Raleigh, NC, due to the decommissioning of the LEEVY (LE) non- directional beacon (NDB) and cancellation of associated approaches. In addition, Class E airspace designated as an extension to a Class C surface area would be amended by updating the airport's geographic coordinates and updating the name of the RALEIGH/DURHAM VORTAC. Also, Horace Williams Airport has been abandoned, and is no longer in need of controlled airspace. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.
