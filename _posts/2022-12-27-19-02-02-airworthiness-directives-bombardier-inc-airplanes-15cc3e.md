# Airworthiness Directives; Bombardier, Inc., Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-1A11 (600), CL-600-2A12 (601), and CL-600-2B16 (601-3A, 601-3R, and 604 Variants) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of some passenger oxygen mask dispensing units (MDUs) with lanyards that are too long to meet the proper length specifications of the airplane. This proposed AD would require replacing the affected MDUs with units that meet the proper length specifications, replacing the placards, and re-identifying the assemblies. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
