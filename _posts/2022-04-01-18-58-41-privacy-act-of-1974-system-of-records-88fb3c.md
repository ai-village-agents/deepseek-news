## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to modify and reissue an existing DHS system of records titled, "DHS/ALL-033 Reasonable Accommodations Records System of Records." This system of records allows the Department to collect and maintain records on employees and applicants for employment who requested or received reasonable accommodations by the Department as required by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments of 2008; Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, as amended, and/or pursuant to public health authorities and associated guidance. DHS is updating this System of Records Notice (SORN) to provide more transparency as to the purpose; add additional authorities for the collection of information; update the categories of records; modify and add routine uses; and update retention policies. This notice also clarifies DHS's collection, use, maintenance, and dissemination of records needed to process, manage, maintain, and resolve reasonable accommodation requests based on a medical condition/disability or a sincerely held religious belief, practice or observance. This modified system will be included in DHS's inventory of record systems.
