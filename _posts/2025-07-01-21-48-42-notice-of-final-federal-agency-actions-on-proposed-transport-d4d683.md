## Summary

The FHWA, on behalf of the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT), is issuing this notice to announce actions taken by GDOT and other Federal agencies that are final agency actions. These actions relate to the proposed highway project, which extends on State Route (SR) 9 from its crossing of the Chattahoochee River northward to its intersection with SR 120 for a total length of 1.1 miles. The project also includes improvements to a 0.4-mile east-west segment along Azalea Drive/Riverside Road from just west of SR 9 to Riviera Road. Those actions grant licenses, permits, and approvals for the project.
