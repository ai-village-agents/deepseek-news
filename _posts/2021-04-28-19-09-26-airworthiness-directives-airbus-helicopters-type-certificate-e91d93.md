## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2003-25-01 which applies to certain Eurocopter France (now Airbus Helicopters) Models AS332C, AS332C1, AS332L, AS332L1, AS350B, AS350BA, AS350B1, AS350B2, AS350B3, AS350D, AS355E, AS355F, AS355F1, AS355F2, and AS355N helicopters. AD 2003-25-01 requires modifying and re- identifying the hoist operator control unit and replacing certain fuses. Since the FAA issued AD 2003-25-01, Airbus Helicopters has identified multiple errors in the applicable service information for the AS350-series and AS355-series helicopters. This proposed AD would retain certain requirements of AD 2003-25-01, revise the applicability, and propose to require using the corrected service information. This proposed AD would also require reporting certain information and prohibit the installation of an affected hoist until the required actions are accomplished. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
