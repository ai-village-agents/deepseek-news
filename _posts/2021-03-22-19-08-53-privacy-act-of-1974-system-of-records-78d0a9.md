## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to establish a new DHS system of records titled, "DHS/Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-015 Fraud Investigations System of Records." This system of records allows DHS/FEMA to collect and maintain records on individuals who are being investigated for or involved in an investigation relating to the misuse of federal disaster funds and/or benefits. This system of records further assists FEMA's Fraud Investigations and Inspections Division (FIID) recordkeeping; tracking and managing fraud inquiries, investigative referrals, and law enforcement requests; and case determinations involving disaster funds and/or benefits fraud, criminal activity, public safety, and national security concerns. Additionally, DHS is issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to exempt this system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act, elsewhere in the Federal Register.
