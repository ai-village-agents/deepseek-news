## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the Farm Service Agency (FSA) is requesting comments from all interested individuals and organizations on a revision and an extension of the information collection associated with online and in-person registration for FSA-hosted events and conferences. The information collection is needed for FSA to obtain information from the respondents who register on the internet to access and make preparation for participation in events, and when necessary, to make payment and reservations to attend any FSA-hosted conferences and events. Additionally, the demographic data collected through this information collection assists FSA in monitoring its outreach and engagement of farmers and ranchers.
