## Summary

The Coast Guard is issuing this final rule to adjust the limits of liability for vessels, deepwater ports, and onshore facilities under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90), as amended, to reflect the increase in the Consumer Price Index since they were last adjusted in 2019. These regulatory inflation increases to the limits of liability are required by OPA 90 and are necessary to preserve the deterrent effect and "polluter pays" principle embodied in the Act. This update promotes the Coast Guard's missions of maritime safety and stewardship.
