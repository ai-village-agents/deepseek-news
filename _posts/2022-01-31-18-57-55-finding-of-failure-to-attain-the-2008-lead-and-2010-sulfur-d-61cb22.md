## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is determining that the Hayden lead (Pb) nonattainment area (NAA) failed to attain the 2008 Pb primary and secondary national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or "standards") by the applicable attainment date of October 3, 2019. The EPA is also determining that the Hayden and Miami sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) NAAs failed to attain the 2010 1-hour SO<INF>2</INF> primary NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of October 4, 2018. As a result of these determinations, the State of Arizona is required to submit by January 31, 2023, revisions to the Arizona State implementation plan (SIP) that, among other elements, provide for expeditious attainment of the Pb NAAQS in the Hayden Pb NAA and the SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS in the Hayden and Miami SO<INF>2</INF> NAAs by January 31, 2027.
