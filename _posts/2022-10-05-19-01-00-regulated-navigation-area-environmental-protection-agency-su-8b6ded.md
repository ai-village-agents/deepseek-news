## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a permanent regulated navigation area (RNA) for all navigable waters within the area of lines drawn from Dune Park downward to the Point Ruston Historic Ferry dock on Commencement Bay, WA. This RNA is necessary to preserve the integrity of protective sediment caps placed in multiple areas within this waterway as part of the remediation process at the Commencement Bay, Nearshore/Tideflats Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Superfund Cleanup Site. This RNA prohibits activities which would disturb the seabed, such as anchoring, dragging, trawling, spudding, or other activities that involve disrupting the integrity of the sediment cap, unless authorized by the Captain of the Port (COTP) Puget Sound or their Designated Representative. The RNA will not affect vessels transiting or navigating within this waterway.
