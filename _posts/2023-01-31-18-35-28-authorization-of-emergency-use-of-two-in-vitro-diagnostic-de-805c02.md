## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the issuance of Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) (the Authorizations) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) in response to an outbreak of mpox. FDA has issued an Authorization for an in vitro diagnostic device as requested by Becton, Dickinson & Company (BD) and DiaCarta, Inc. The Authorizations contain, among other things, conditions on the emergency use of the authorized products. The Authorizations follow the August 9, 2022, determination by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) that there is a public health emergency, or a significant potential for a public health emergency, that affects, or has a significant potential to affect, national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens living abroad, and that involves monkeypox virus. On the basis of such determination, the Secretary of HHS declared, on September 7, 2022, that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detection and/or diagnosis of infection with the monkeypox virus, including in vitro diagnostics that detect and/or diagnose infection with non-variola Orthopoxvirus, pursuant to the FD&C Act, subject to terms of any authorization issued under that section. The Authorizations, which include an explanation of the reasons for issuance, are reprinted in this document.
