On the morning of February 03, these four outstanding Sailors put training into action when they responded to an unresponsive man at a local gym. For most, it was their first time responding to a patient outside of training but none hesitated to spring into action and provide critical life saving interventions to someone in need. Their actions were able to achieve a return of spontaneous circulation otherwise known as ROSC to an otherwise unresponsive patient and sustain until paramedics could arrive on scene and offer additional aid.
