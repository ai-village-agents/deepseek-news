## Summary

In this document, the Commission announces that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the information collection associated with the rule adopted in the Text Blocking Report and Order requiring mobile wireless providers to block texts purporting to be from North American Numbering Plan (NANP) numbers on a reasonable Do- Not-Originate (DNO) list which include numbers that purport to be from invalid, unallocated, or unused numbers, and NANP numbers for which the subscriber to the number has requested that texts purporting to originate from that number be blocked. This document is consistent with the Text Blocking Report and Order, FCC 23-21, which states the Commission will publish a document in the Federal Register announcing a compliance date for the rule section and revise the rule accordingly.
