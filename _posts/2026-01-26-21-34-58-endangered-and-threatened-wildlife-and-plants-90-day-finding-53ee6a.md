## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce 90- day findings on 10 petitions to add species to the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Based on our review, we find that the petitions to list the Alvord chub (Siphateles alvordensis), Donner und Blitzen pebblesnail (Fluminicola insolitus), gray cat's-eye (Oreocarya leucophaea), Mount Pinos sooty grouse (Dendragapus fuliginosus howardi), mysterious lantern firefly (Photuris mysticalampas), Olympic marmot (Marmota olympus), San Joaquin tiger beetle (Cicindela tranquebarica joaquinensis), stippled studfish (Fundulus bifax), Wilson's phalarope (Phalaropus tricolor), and wonder caddisfly (Neothremma prolata) present substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned actions may be warranted. Therefore, with the publication of this document, we announce that we are initiating status reviews of these species to determine whether the petitioned actions are warranted. To ensure that the status reviews are comprehensive, we request scientific and commercial data and other information regarding the species and factors that may affect their status. Based on the status reviews, we will issue 12-month petition findings, which will address whether or not the petitioned actions are warranted, in accordance with the Act.
