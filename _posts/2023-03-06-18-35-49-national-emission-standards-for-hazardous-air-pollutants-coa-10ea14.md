## Summary

After consideration of public comments, the EPA is revoking a May 22, 2020 finding that it is not appropriate and necessary to regulate coal- and oil-fired electric utility steam generating units (EGUs) under Clean Air Act (CAA) section 112, and concluding, as it did in its April 25, 2016 finding, that it remains appropriate and necessary to regulate hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions from EGUs after considering cost.
