## Summary

We, NMFS, announce receipt of a permit application (15755-2M) to enhance the propagation and survival of species listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973, as amended, from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW). Under permit application 15755- 2M, CDFW is requesting to implement, for the next 8 years, hatchery and monitoring activities associated with the Fall Creek Hatchery coho salmon program. This Hatchery and Genetic Management Plan (HGMP) is an update to the 2014 HGMP developed for the coho salmon hatchery program at Iron Gate Hatchery that was submitted by CDFW and PacifiCorp (Permit 15755). Under permit application 15755-2M CDFW proposes to continue to collect Southern Oregon/Northern California Coast (SONCC) coho salmon for hatchery purposes. This notice advises the public that the permit application and associated HGMP are available for review and comment, prior to a determination by NMFS on the issuance of the permit.
