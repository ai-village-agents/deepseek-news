## Summary

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) is issuing this supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (Supplemental NPR) to update its regulation interpreting section 6(b) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA) (6(b) Regulation). On February 26, 2014, the Commission issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in this matter (2014 NPR). The 2014 NPR proposed to modernize the 6(b) Regulation to account for the significant improvements in information technology that have occurred since the regulation's initial adoption in 1983, and streamline the 6(b) Regulation to align more closely with the text of section 6(b), including with respect to protecting information filed by manufacturers, distributors, and retailers in accordance with the requirements of section 15(b) of the CPSA. This Supplemental NPR responds to public comments on the 2014 NPR and proposes additional changes to the 6(b) Regulation to further modernize and align the regulation with the statute.
