## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to deny the exemption request from the Tornado Bus Company (Tornado). Tornado requests an exemption from certain provisions of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) for its drivers who currently hold a Mexican Licencia Federal de Conductor (LFC), and are seeking permanent resident status in the United States through the Department of Homeland Security and have over two years' experience driving in the United States (U.S.) and Mexico. The exemption would cover general entry-level driver training (ELDT) requirements, required knowledge testing for the commercial driver's license (CDL), required skills testing for the CDL, and requirements for knowledge and skills testing to obtain a CDL passenger endorsement. FMCSA analyzed the exemption application and public comments and determined that the application does not demonstrate that the exemption would likely ensure a level of safety equivalent to or greater than would be achieved absent such exemption.
