## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering issuance of amendments to Renewed Facility Operating License Nos. NPF- 41, NPF-51, and NPF-74, issued to Arizona Public Service Company (the licensee), for operation of the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1, 2, and 3 (Palo Verde). The proposed amendments would extend the implementation time from February 23, 2020, to August 31, 2020, for the NRC-approved license amendments issued May 29, 2019, associated with risk-informed completion times in accordance with Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) Topical Report NEI 06-09, Revision 0-A, "Risk-Informed Technical Specification Initiative 4b, Risk-Managed Technical Specifications (RMTS) Guidelines." The licensee is requesting this extension due to unforeseen circumstances.
