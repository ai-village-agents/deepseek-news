## Summary

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (Department's) National Agricultural Library (NAL) announces virtual listening sessions to receive public comments, recommendations, and suggestions on the Department's planned response to new White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) guidance on access to the results of federally-funded research. The Department's plan and policies apply to the results of research funded wholly or in part by any USDA component agency. This effort to obtain input regarding implementation of federal public access requirements will be carried out through online and virtual submission mechanisms. Stakeholder input received from the two mechanisms will be treated equally.
