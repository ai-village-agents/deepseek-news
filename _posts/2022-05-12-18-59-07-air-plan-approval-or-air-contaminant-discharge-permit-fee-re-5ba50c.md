## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a revision to the Oregon State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted on November 5, 2020. The revision establishes new fees to be paid by stationary sources of air contaminants that submit notices of intent to construct. The revision also adds a new basic air contaminant discharge permit category to allow certain minor sources, that would otherwise be required to obtain a general, simple, or standard permit, the option to qualify for a basic permit.
