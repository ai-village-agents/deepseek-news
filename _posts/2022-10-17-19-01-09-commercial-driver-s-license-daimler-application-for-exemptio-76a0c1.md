## Summary

FMCSA announces that Daimler Truck North America LLC (Daimler) has requested an exemption for one commercial motor vehicle (CMV) driver from the requirement to hold a United States commercial driver's license (CDL). Daimler requests an exemption for Dr. Andreas Gorbach, Executive Vice President and Board of Management Member for Daimler. Dr. Gorbach holds a valid German CDL. Daimler believes the requirements for a German commercial license ensure that operation under the exemption will likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to or greater than the level that would be obtained in the absence of the exemption. FMCSA requests public comment on the applicant's request for exemption.
