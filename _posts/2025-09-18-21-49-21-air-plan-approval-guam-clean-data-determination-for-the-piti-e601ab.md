## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action on a clean data determination (CDD) for the Piti-Cabras, Guam sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) nonattainment area ("Piti-Cabras area") based on our determination that the area has attained the 2010 1-hour SO<INF>2</INF> National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS, "standard," or "2010 SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS"). In designated nonattainment areas where air quality data demonstrate that a NAAQS has been attained, the EPA interprets certain requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA) as no longer applicable for so long as air quality continues to meet the standard. Under this Clean Data Policy, the EPA may issue a determination of attainment, known as a CDD, that a nonattainment area is attaining the relevant NAAQS. This CDD suspends the obligation to submit certain attainment planning requirements for the Piti-Cabras area for as long as the area continues to attain the 2010 SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS or until the area is formally redesignated. This CDD does not constitute redesignation of the area to attainment. This action is being taken under the CAA.
