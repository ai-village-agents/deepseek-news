## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Embraer S.A. Model ERJ 190-300 and -400 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of friction marks on the engine fire extinguishing system tube, in the region of the aft fairing of the left-hand (LH) pylon. This AD requires rework of the retainer of the LH pylon access panel, inspection and replacement, as applicable, of the LH engine fire extinguishing system tube, and installation of a support, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
