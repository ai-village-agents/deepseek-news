## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission" or the "SEC") is proposing to amend the rules under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Investment Company Act") and under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the "Advisers Act") that define the terms "small business" and "small organization" for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (the "RFA") to increase the asset-based thresholds used in those definitions. The Commission also is proposing a mechanism for periodic future inflation adjustments of the asset- based thresholds used in these definitions. The Commission further is proposing amendments to Form ADV and the rule providing continuing hardship exemptions from filing electronically for investment advisers in connection with the proposed amendments.
