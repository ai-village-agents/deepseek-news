## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-14-09, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; Model A319 series airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, - 216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, - 211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2018-14-09 requires repetitive inspections for cracking of the fastener holes in certain fuselage frames, and depending on airplane configuration, provides an optional terminating action to the repetitive inspections. Since the FAA issued AD 2018-14-09, it was determined that additional actions are necessary beyond those required by AD 2018-14-09. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2018-14-09 and would require modified compliance times, as well as further inspections and optional terminating actions for certain airplanes, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
