## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is denying a request for a hearing submitted by Bernardo Garmendia, also known as Bernardo Germendia, (Garmendia) and is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) permanently debarring Garmendia from providing services in any capacity to a person that has an approved or pending drug product application. FDA bases this order on a finding that Garmendia was convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct relating to the development or approval, including the process for development or approval, of any drug product under the FD&C Act. FDA provided notice to Garmendia of the proposed debarment and an opportunity to request a hearing within the timeframe prescribed by regulation. Garmendia submitted a request for hearing but failed to file with the Agency information and analyses sufficient to create a basis for a hearing.
