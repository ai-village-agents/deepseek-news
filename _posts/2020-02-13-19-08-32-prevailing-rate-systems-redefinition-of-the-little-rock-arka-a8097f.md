## Summary

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing a proposed rule that would redefine the geographic boundaries of the Little Rock, Arkansas, and Tulsa, Oklahoma, appropriated fund Federal Wage System (FWS) wage areas. The proposed rule would redefine the Fort Chaffee portion of Franklin County, AR, to the Tulsa wage area. This change is based on a recent consensus recommendation of the Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee (FPRAC).
