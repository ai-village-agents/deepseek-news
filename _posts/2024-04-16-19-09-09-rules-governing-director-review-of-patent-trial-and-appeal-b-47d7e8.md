## Summary

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO or Office) proposes new rules to govern the process for the review of Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB or Board) decisions in America Invents Act (AIA) proceedings by the Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (Director). Specifically, the USPTO proposes these rules in light of stakeholder feedback received in response to a request for comments (RFC). The proposed rules promote the accuracy, consistency, and integrity of PTAB decision-making in Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011 (AIA) proceedings.
