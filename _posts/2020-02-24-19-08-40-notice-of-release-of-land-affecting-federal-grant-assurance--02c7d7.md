## Summary

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is considering a proposal and invites public comment to change a portion of the airport from aeronautical use to non-aeronautical use at Hayward Executive Airport (HWD), Hayward, Alameda County, California. The proposal consists of two parcels, containing a total of 3.18 acres of airport land, located southwest of Taxiway Z, between Taxiways Z and C. These parcels were originally acquired from the federal government as surplus land, via quitclaim deed issued by the War Assets Administration on April 16, 1947. Land adjacent to the parcels was previously released for non-aeronautical revenue generation, for use as a regional fire training facility. The additional two parcels will be leased for non-aeronautical revenue generation, and incorporated into the regional fire training facility. The use of the land for a fire training facility represents a compatible land use that will not interfere with the airport or its operation, thereby protecting the interests of civil aviation. The airport will be compensated for the fair market value of the land.
