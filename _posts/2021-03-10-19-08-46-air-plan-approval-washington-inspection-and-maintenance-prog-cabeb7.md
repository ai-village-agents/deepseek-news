## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is correcting a final rule that appeared in the Federal Register on February 18, 2021, and that will become effective on March 22, 2021. The EPA finalized removal of the Inspection and Maintenance program from the active control measure portion of Washington's State Implementation Plan. This action corrects inadvertent typographical errors in the Federal Register. The corrections described in this action do not affect the substantive requirements of the final rule implementing section 110 of the Clean Air Act.
