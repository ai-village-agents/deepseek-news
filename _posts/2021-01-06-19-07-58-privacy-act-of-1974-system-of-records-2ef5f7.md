## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the DoD is modifying and reissuing a current system of records titled, "Defense Repository for Common Enterprise Data (DRCED)," DUSDC 01. This system of records was originally established by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) to collect and maintain records on various individuals, including active and retired Military Service personnel, their dependents, DoD civilian personnel, and other DoD- affiliated individuals, to support the DoD's defense business enterprise by using technology to synchronize and normalize data to improve affordability, performance, reporting, and mission readiness. This system of records notice (SORN) is being updated to support additional information systems being established within the DoD using the same categories of data for the same purposes. The system number is changing from DUSDC 01 to DoD 0004, to reflect its status as a DoD-wide system of records. The DoD is also modifying the system location, system managers, authority for maintenance of the system, purpose of the system, individuals covered by the system, record source categories, and notification procedures. Additionally, the DoD is issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to exempt this system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act, in today's issue of the Federal Register.
