## Summary

The invention listed below is directed to a T cell receptor (TCR) that specifically targets the Kita-Kyushu Lung Cancer Antigen 1 (KK-LC-1). This TCR may be used to develop novel immunotherapies against several common and aggressive epithelial cancers. It may also be possible to use portions of the KK-LC-1 TCR in chimeric proteins for cancer therapy and/or for antigen detection assays. This technology was discovered and is being developed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The NCI is currently seeking a licensee and/or collaborator to further develop this technology.
