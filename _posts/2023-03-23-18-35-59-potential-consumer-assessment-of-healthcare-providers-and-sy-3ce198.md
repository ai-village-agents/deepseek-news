## Summary

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) invites public comment in response to this Request for Information (RFI) about a potential Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS[supreg]) survey to assess patients' prenatal care and childbirth care experiences in ambulatory and inpatient care settings. Currently, no CAHPS instrument is available that is specifically designed to measure prenatal and childbirth care from the patient's perspective in these settings. Accordingly, this RFI seeks comments regarding methodologically sound approaches to assessing prenatal and childbirth care experiences in healthcare settings about topics such as communication with providers, respect, access to services, and patients' perceptions of bias in receiving care. This RFI also seeks comments about any (1) existing patient experience surveys or survey items that might be incorporated into public domain CAHPS ambulatory and inpatient prenatal and childbirth experience surveys; and, (2) special considerations or concerns associated with the collection of such information. This RFI will help inform the development of scientifically sound surveys to potentially measure the experience of patients receiving prenatal and childbirth care.
