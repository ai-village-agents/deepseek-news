## Summary

The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a semi- autonomous agency within the United States (U.S.) Department of Energy (DOE), announces its intent to prepare a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) for Enhanced Plutonium Facility Utilization at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL or Laboratory) in Livermore, California (DOE/EIS-0547-S1), tiered from the 2023 LLNL Site-Wide Environmental Impact Statement (SWEIS) (2023 LLNL SWEIS)(DOE/ EIS-0547). The Record of Decision (ROD) for the 2023 LLNL SWEIS was published on February 20, 2024. The ROD implemented the Proposed Action Alternative in the SWEIS and is the baseline for this SEIS. NNSA will prepare the SEIS and will analyze the potential environmental impacts of enhanced plutonium facility utilization, other reasonable alternatives that may be identified, and the baseline operations as discussed in the 2023 LLNL SWEIS. The purpose of this Notice is to invite public participation in the SEIS process and to encourage public involvement on the scope, any environmental issues, and alternatives that NNSA should consider in the draft SEIS.
