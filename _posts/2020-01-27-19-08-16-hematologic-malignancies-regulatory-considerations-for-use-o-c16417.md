## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled "Hematologic Malignancies: Regulatory Considerations for Use of Minimal Residual Disease in Development of Drug and Biological Products for Treatment." This guidance is intended to help sponsors planning to use minimal residual disease (MRD) as a biomarker in clinical trials conducted under an investigational new drug application (IND) or to support marketing approval of drugs and biological products for treating specific hematologic malignancies. An analysis of marketing applications showed inconsistent quality of MRD data. Based on this analysis and discussion at various public workshops on MRD, FDA identified a need to provide guidance on the use of MRD as a biomarker in regulatory submissions. This guidance finalizes the draft guidance of the same title issued on October 16, 2018.
