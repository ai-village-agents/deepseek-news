The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the District of Columbia (DC, the District)'s title V operating permits program, submitted on behalf of the District by the Department of Energy and Environment (DOEE). The revision updated title V operating permit fees collected by DOEE in order to ensure that the title V operating program will continue to be adequately funded. The revision also reorganized some sections in Chapter 3 with no substantive change in content. This action is being taken under section 502 of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
