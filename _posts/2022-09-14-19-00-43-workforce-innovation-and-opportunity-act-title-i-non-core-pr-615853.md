## Summary

The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) established six primary indicators of performance for certain WIOA- authorized programs. Currently, the regulations contain definitions for five of the six performance indicators. In the final rule implementing WIOA, the U.S. Departments of Labor and Education (the Departments) indicated that they would initially implement the sixth indicator of performance--effectiveness in serving employers--in the form of a pilot program to test the feasibility and rigor of three proposed approaches. With the pilot completed, the Departments are engaging in a rulemaking under RIN 1205-AC01 to incorporate a standard definition of the performance indicator for effectiveness in serving employers into the implementing regulations for the six WIOA core programs. In this related rulemaking, the Department of Labor (DOL or the Department) is proposing to incorporate the same definition of the effectiveness in serving employers performance indicator into regulations for title I non-core programs: the Indian and Native American (INA) programs, the Job Corps program, the YouthBuild programs, and the National Farmworker Jobs Program (NFJP).
