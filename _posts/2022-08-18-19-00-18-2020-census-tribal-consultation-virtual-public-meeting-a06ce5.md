## Summary

The Census Bureau will conduct a tribal consultation on the second and final 2010 Demonstration Data Product for the Demographic and Housing Characteristics File (DHC) on September 19, 2022, via national webinar. Feedback on this demonstration data product will help to determine the final parameter and settings for the 2020 DHC. The tribal consultation meeting reflects the Census Bureau's continuous commitment to strengthen nation-to-nation relationships with federally recognized tribes. The Census Bureau's procedures for outreach, notice, and consultation ensure involvement of tribes to the extent practicable and permitted by law before making decisions or implementing policies, rules, or programs that affect federally recognized tribal governments. These meetings are open to citizens of federally recognized tribes by invitation. The Census Bureau conducted a tribal listening session on Thursday, August 18, 2022, to prepare tribes for the September virtual tribal consultation and sent materials to the tribes to help with their analysis of the demonstration data product. The Census Bureau provided questions in preparation for the virtual tribal consultation focused on the DHC. In that regard, the Census Bureau is asking tribal governments to identify potentially problematic results from the application of disclosure avoidance to the 2010 demonstration data. Helpful feedback would include identification of tables and geographies that are acceptable and unacceptable. The purpose of the virtual tribal consultation is to hear tribes' recommendations.
