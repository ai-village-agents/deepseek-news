## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, have received an application from Prosperity Wind LLC (applicant), for an incidental take permit (ITP) under the Endangered Species Act, for its Prosperity Wind Project (project). If approved, the ITP would be for a 6-year period and would authorize the incidental take of two endangered species, the Indiana bat and the northern long-eared bat, and one species proposed as endangered, the tricolored bat. The applicant has prepared a proposed habitat conservation plan (HCP) in support of the application. We request public comment on the application, which includes the applicant's HCP, and on the Service's preliminary determination that the proposed permitting action may be eligible for a categorical exclusion pursuant to the Council on Environmental Quality's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations, the Department of the Interior's (DOI) NEPA regulations, and the DOI Departmental Manual. To make this preliminary determination, we prepared a draft environmental action statement and low-effect screening form, both of which are also available for public review. We invite comment from the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies.
