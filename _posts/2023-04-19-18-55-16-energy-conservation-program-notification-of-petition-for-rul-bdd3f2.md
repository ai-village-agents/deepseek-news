## Summary

On January 12, 2023, the Department of Energy ("DOE") received a petition from the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers ("AHAM") to consider amendments to the conventional cooking products test procedure to allow a calculation in place of certain testing provisions for conventional cooking tops, clarify the definition of the term specialty cooking zone, clarify the equipment used to measure electric coil heating element diameter, and stay the effectiveness of any mandatory use of the test procedure. Through this notification, DOE seeks comment on the petition, as well as any data or information that could be used in DOE's determination whether to grant the petition.
