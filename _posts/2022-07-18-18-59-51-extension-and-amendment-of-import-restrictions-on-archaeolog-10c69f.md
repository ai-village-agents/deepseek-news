## Summary

This document amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regulations to reflect an extension and amendment of import restrictions on Pre-Classical and Classical archaeological objects, and Byzantine and Post-Byzantine ecclesiastical and ritual ethnological materials of the Republic of Cyprus. To fulfill the terms of the new agreement, titled "Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Cyprus Concerning the Imposition of Import Restrictions on Categories of Archaeological and Ethnological Material of the Republic of Cyprus", the Designated List, which was last described in CBP-Dec. 12-13, is amended in this document to reflect additional categories of archaeological material from an extended date range from the end of the Classical Period to A.D. 1770 and additional categories of ethnological material including architectural material, documents and manuscripts, traditional clothing, and emblems of the state.
