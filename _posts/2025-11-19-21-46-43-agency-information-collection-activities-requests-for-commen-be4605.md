## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites the public to make comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on June 24, 2025. The collection involves submission of an AC Form 8050-5, Dealer's Aircraft Registration Certificate Application, by companies or individuals to obtain a Dealer's Aircraft Registration Certificate, which allows operation of an aircraft in lieu of obtaining a permanent aircraft registration certificate. The information collection is necessary for a dealer to operate an aircraft without a permanent aircraft registration certificate.
