## Summary

This document amends U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regulations by revising the list of user fee airports. User fee airports are airports that have been approved by CBP to receive, for a fee, the customs services of CBP officers for processing aircraft, passengers, and cargo entering the United States, but do not qualify for designation as international or landing rights airports. Specifically, this technical amendment reflects the designation of user fee status for four additional airports: Coeur d'Alene Airport in Hayden, Idaho; Ithaca Tompkins Regional Airport in Ithaca, New York; University of Illinois-Willard Airport in Savoy, Illinois; and Sheboygan County Memorial Airport in Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin. This document also amends CBP regulations by removing the designation of user fee status for two airports: Ardmore Industrial Airpark, in Ardmore, Oklahoma, and Decatur Airport in Decatur, Illinois.
