## Summary

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is publishing this final rule amending the regulations regarding DEA Form 106, used by DEA registrants to formally report thefts or significant losses of controlled substances, to require that all such forms be submitted electronically, and to clarify the time frame registrants have to complete the necessary documentation. This final rule does not change the requirement that registrants preliminarily notify the DEA Field Division Office in their area, in writing, of the theft or significant loss of any controlled substances within one business day of discovering such loss or theft. Paper copies of DEA Form 106 simply will no longer be accepted once the final rule becomes effective.
