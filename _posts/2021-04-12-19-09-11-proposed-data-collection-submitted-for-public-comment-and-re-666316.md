## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled TEMPORARY HALT IN RESIDENTIAL EVICTIONS TO PREVENT THE FURTHER SPREAD OF COVID-19. The information collection originally pertained to the September 4, 2020 CDC Order of the same name that temporarily halts residential evictions of covered persons for nonpayment of rent from September 4, 2020, through December 31, 2020. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, statutorily extended CDC's Order until January 31, 2021. On January 29, 2021, the CDC Director renewed the Order until March 31, 2021. As of March 31, the Order is further extended until June 30, 2021. The Declaration in this information collection request will serve as an attestation by a tenant, lessee, or resident that they meet the criteria therein, to prevent an eviction proceeding per the Order issued by the CDC.
