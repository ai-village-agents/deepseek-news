## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or "Agency") proposes to approve portions of two state implementation plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of California to meet Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act") requirements for the 2006 fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or "standards") in the San Joaquin Valley (SJV) Serious nonattainment area. Specifically, the EPA proposes to approve those portions of the "2018 Plan for the 1997, 2006, and 2012 PM<INF>2.5</INF> Standards" and the "San Joaquin Valley Supplement to the 2016 State Strategy for the State Implementation Plan" that pertain to the 2006 PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS and address CAA requirements for Serious PM<INF>2.5</INF> nonattainment areas. The EPA also proposes to approve inter-pollutant trading ratios for use in transportation conformity analyses for the 2006 PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS. As part of this action, the EPA proposes to grant an extension of the Serious area attainment date for the 2006 PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS in the San Joaquin Valley from December 31, 2019, to December 31, 2024 based on a proposed determination that the State has satisfied the statutory criteria for this extension. We may, however, reconsider this proposal or deny California's request for extension of the attainment date if, based on new information or public comments, we find that the State has not satisfied the statutory criteria for this extension.
