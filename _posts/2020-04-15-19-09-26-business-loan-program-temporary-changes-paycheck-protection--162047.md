## Summary

Elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is publishing an interim final rule (the Initial Rule) announcing the implementation of sections 1102 and 1106 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act or the Act). Section 1102 of the Act temporarily adds a new program, titled the "Paycheck Protection Program," to the SBA's 7(a) Loan Program. Section 1106 of the Act provides for forgiveness of up to the full principal amount of qualifying loans guaranteed under the Paycheck Protection Program. The Paycheck Protection Program and loan forgiveness are intended to provide economic relief to small businesses nationwide adversely impacted by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19). This interim final rule supplements the Initial Rule with additional guidance regarding the application of certain affiliate rules applicable to SBA's implementation of sections 1102 and 1106 of the Act and requests public comment.
