## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 757-200, -200CB, and -200PF series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of cracks found at the main deck cargo door forward and aft hinge attachment holes. This proposed AD would require a maintenance records check for repairs at the forward and aft hinge areas of the main deck cargo door cutout; repetitive open-hole high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections for cracks in the unrepaired areas of the bear strap, skin, doubler, and upper sill chord at the main deck cargo door forward and aft hinge attachment holes; and corrective actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
