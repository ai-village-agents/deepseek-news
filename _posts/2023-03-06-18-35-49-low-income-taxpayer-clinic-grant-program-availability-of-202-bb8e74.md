## Summary

This document contains a notice that the IRS has provided a supplemental grant opportunity in www.grants.gov for organizations interested in applying for a Low Income Taxpayer Clinic (LITC) matching supplemental grant. The budget and the period of performance for the supplemental grant will be July 1, 2023-December 31, 2023. The application period runs from March 7, 2023, through April 18, 2023. Due to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, the LITC Program Office has more funding for fiscal year 2023, and the maximum amount of an award an organization can receive for year 2023 has been increased from $100,000 to $200,000. Organizations currently receiving an LITC grant for 2023 are also eligible for an increase in funding up to $200,000 (including any funds already awarded); however, those organizations do not need to apply in response to this notice and instead will be contacted directly by the LITC Program Office. For all other organizations applying for a supplemental grant for the remainder of 2023, the following process applies.
