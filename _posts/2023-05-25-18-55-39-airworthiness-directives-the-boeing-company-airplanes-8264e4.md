## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-26-08 which applies to The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines. AD 2020-26- 08 requires repetitive inspections of the inner fixed structure (IFS) forward upper fire seal and thermal insulation blankets in the forward upper area of the thrust reverser (TR) for damage and applicable on- condition actions. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-26-08, it was determined a new upper splitter fairing assembly is needed to prevent the damage to the fire seal and thermal insulation blanket. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions specified in AD 2020- 26-08 and would require determining if an affected part number of the upper splitter fairing assembly is installed on the engine, replacing an affected upper splitter fairing assembly part number with a new upper splitter fairing assembly part number, inspecting the IFS forward upper fire seal and thermal insulation blanket for any damage, and applicable on-condition actions. This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
