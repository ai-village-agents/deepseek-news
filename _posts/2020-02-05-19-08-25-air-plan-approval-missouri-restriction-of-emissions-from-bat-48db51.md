## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a Missouri State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision received on March 7, 2019. The submission revises a Missouri regulation that establishes emission limits for batch-type charcoal kilns based on operational parameters to reduce emissions of particulate matter (PM<INF>10</INF>), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and carbon monoxide (CO). Specifically, the revisions to the rule add definitions specific to the rule, update references to test methods, remove unnecessary words, remove an obsolete requirement which applied only during the phase-in period of the rule that ended December 31, 2005, clarify a provision for an alternative operating temperature, and make other minor edits. These revisions are administrative in nature and do not impact the stringency of the SIP or air quality. Approval of these revisions will ensure consistency between State and federally-approved rules.
