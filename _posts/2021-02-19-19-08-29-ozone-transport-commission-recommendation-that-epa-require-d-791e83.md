## Summary

On January 15, 2021, EPA issued a Federal Register notice of public hearing and supplemental information regarding a recommendation submitted by the Ozone Transport Commission (OTC) to address ongoing ozone pollution in the northeastern United States. The OTC has recommended that EPA require Pennsylvania to revise its state implementation plan (SIP) to include additional control measures that would establish daily limits on emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) from coal-fired electricity generating units (EGUs) with already-installed selective catalytic reduction (SCR) or selective noncatalytic reduction (SNCR) controls. This document extends the comment period for 30 days, from March 8, 2021 to April 7, 2021.
