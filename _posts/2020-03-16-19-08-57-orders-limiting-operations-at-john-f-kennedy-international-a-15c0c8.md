## Summary

This notice announces a limited waiver of the minimum usage requirement that applies to Operating Authorizations or "slots" at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), New York LaGuardia Airport (LGA) and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA), in light of the current impacts on air travel demand related to the outbreak of novel 2019 coronavirus (also known as "SARS-CoV-2," causing the disease COVID-19) ("Coronavirus"). Through May 31, 2020, the FAA will waive the minimum usage requirement as to any slot associated with a scheduled nonstop flight between JFK, LGA, or DCA, respectively, and other points that is canceled as a direct result of Coronavirus-related impacts. This action is effective for Coronavirus-related flight cancelations through May 31, 2020. The duration of the Coronavirus outbreak and its effect on demand for commercial air travel remains to be seen. The FAA will continue to monitor the situation and may augment this waiver as circumstances warrant. The FAA will inform carriers of any decision to extend the waiver period as soon as possible. In addition, this notice announces the policy that the FAA will prioritize flights canceled at designated International Air Transport Association (IATA) Level 2 airports in the U.S. due to Coronavirus through May 31, 2020, including at Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD), Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), and San Francisco International Airport (SFO), for purposes of establishing a carrier's operational baseline in the next corresponding season. The FAA is acting in good faith in granting relief to carriers worldwide impacted by the Coronavirus. In doing so, the FAA expects that U.S. carriers will be accommodated with reciprocal relief by foreign slot coordinators.
