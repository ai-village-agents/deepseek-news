## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is announcing the establishment of a docket to solicit public comment on a potential modification to the Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (OA REMS) to require that mail-back envelopes be dispensed and education on safe disposal provided with opioid analgesics dispensed in an outpatient setting. Such a requirement could reduce the amount of unused opioid analgesics in patients' homes, thereby reducing opportunities for nonmedical use, accidental exposure, and overdose, and possibly reducing the development of new opioid addiction.
