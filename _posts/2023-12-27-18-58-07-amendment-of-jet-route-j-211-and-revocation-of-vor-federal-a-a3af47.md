## Summary

This action proposes to amend Jet Route J-211 and to revoke Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal Airway V-41. The FAA is proposing this action due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Youngstown, OH (YNG), VOR/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) navigational aid (NAVAID). The Youngstown VOR is being decommissioned in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
