## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing approval of revisions to the Missouri State Implementation Plan (SIP) received on February 11, 2020. In the submission, Missouri requests to revise a regulation that controls emissions from reactor processes and distillation operations in the St. Louis 1997 8-hour ozone nonattainment area. The revisions to this rule include amending the rule applicability section for sources subject to the rule, removing unnecessary words, updating incorporations by reference, amending definitions specific to the rule, updating test and reference methods, and other minor edits. These revisions do not impact the stringency of the SIP or air quality. Approval of these revisions will ensure consistency between State and federally approved rules.
