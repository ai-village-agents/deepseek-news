## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG Model Trent 1000-AE3, Trent 1000- CE3, Trent 1000-D3, Trent 1000-G3, Trent 1000-H3, Trent 1000-J3, Trent 1000-K3, Trent 1000-L3, Trent 1000-M3, Trent 1000-N3, Trent 1000-P3, Trent 1000-Q3, Trent 1000-R3, Trent 7000-72, and Trent 7000-72C engines. This AD was prompted by reports of cracked intermediate pressure compressor (IPC) shaft assembly front air seals. This AD requires an inspection of the affected IPC shaft assembly for cracking and, depending on the results of the inspection, repetitive inspections or replacement of the IPC shaft assembly front air seals, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
