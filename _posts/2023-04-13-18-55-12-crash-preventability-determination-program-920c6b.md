## Summary

To address industry concerns about all crashes being used in the Agency's Safety Measurement System (SMS), since May 2020 FMCSA has been operating the Crash Preventability Determination Program (CPDP). This program reviews 16 specific crash types and modifies information in the SMS to distinguish not preventable crashes. The existing program was an expansion of the Agency's previous demonstration program that reviewed eight specific crash types. Through the incorporation of this information into SMS, FMCSA is better positioned to identify unsafe carrier and driver behaviors and prioritize carriers for interventions, by excluding not preventable crashes when calculating a motor carrier's Crash Indicator Behavior Analysis Safety Improvement Category measure and percentile Based on the Agency's experiences with the crash types and its reviews of crash eligibility, FMCSA proposes modifying existing crash types to broaden eligibility, removing the distinction between direct and indirect strikes, and differentiating some types for improved reporting and use of the data to identify ways to reduce crashes involving non-motorists, in alignment with the Department of Transportation's National Roadway Safety Strategies at www.transportation.gov/NRSS. In addition, FMCSA proposes that four new crash types be included in the program. FMCSA seeks comments on these proposed changes. FMCSA will respond to comments it receives on the proposal and announce the start of the updated CPDP through a subsequent Federal Register notice.
