## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the Tuolumne County Air Pollution Control District's (TCAPCD or "District") portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). This revision governs the District's issuance of permits for stationary sources, and focuses on the preconstruction review and permitting of major sources and major modifications under part D of title I of the Clean Air Act (CAA or "the Act"). We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
