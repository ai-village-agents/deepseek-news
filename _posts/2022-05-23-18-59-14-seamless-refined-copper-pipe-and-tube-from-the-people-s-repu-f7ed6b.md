## Summary

As a result of the determinations by the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) orders on seamless refined copper pipe and tube from the People's Republic of China (China) and Mexico would likely lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping and material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is publishing this notice of continuation of the orders.
