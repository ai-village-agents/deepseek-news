## Summary

Under the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving the limited maintenance plans (LMPs) submitted by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) for the Canton-Massillon (Stark County), Cleveland-Akron-Lorain (Cuyahoga, Lake, Lorain, Medina, Portage, and Summit Counties) and Steubenville- Weirton Ohio-West Virginia (Jefferson County) maintenance areas. The plans address the second 10-year maintenance periods for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 2.5 micrometers (PM<INF>2.5</INF>). EPA is approving Ohio's LMP submissions for Canton-Massillon, Cleveland-Akron-Lorain, and Steubenville-Weirton because they provide for the maintenance of the 2006 PM<INF>2.5</INF> national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) through the end of the second 10-year portion of the maintenance periods. EPA finds adequate and is approving the LMPs as meeting the appropriate transportation conformity requirements. EPA proposed to approve this action on July 5, 2023, and received no adverse comments.
