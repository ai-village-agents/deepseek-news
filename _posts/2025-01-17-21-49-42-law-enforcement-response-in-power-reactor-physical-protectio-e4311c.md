## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing a notice of proposed interpretation of regulatory requirements to clarify that a power reactor applicant or licensee may, when designing or updating its physical protection program, incorporate law enforcement response into its site physical protection program through the implementation of a site-specific Security Bounding Time. This proposed interpretation would provide flexibility to applicants and licensees by allowing them to consider the assistance of law enforcement responders as part of the physical protection program. The NRC is requesting comment on the proposed interpretation and will hold a public meeting during the public comment period to address questions regarding the proposed interpretation and to facilitate public comments.
