## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 757 airplanes. This AD was prompted by significant changes, including new or more restrictive requirements, made to the airworthiness limitations (AWLs) related to fuel tank ignition prevention and the nitrogen generation system. This AD requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
