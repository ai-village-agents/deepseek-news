## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is rescinding a discrete number of regulations regarding agency rules of practice and procedure for general hearing management, formal adjudications, and administrative tort claims because they are either inconsistent with statutory requirements or duplicative of statutory requirements and other binding regulations. The NRC is not soliciting public comment on these changes because the changes are limited to agency rules of procedure and practice that do not affect the substantive rights and responsibilities of outside parties.
