## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of corrosion on one or more of the eight lower fitting assemblies and adjacent lavatory components on certain lavatories. This proposed AD would require a detailed inspection of the lower fitting assemblies and the centerline partition threshold of the lavatories for corrosion, recording on the modification record placard, and applicable on-condition actions. This proposed AD would also require revising the existing maintenance program to incorporate a detailed inspection of the lavatory vertical side forward fittings for corrosion or damage. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
