## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that longitudinal sealing tape in the forward and aft cargo compartments had migrated from its original position, which could affect the fire extinguishing system efficiency in the cargo compartments. This AD requires repetitive detailed inspection of the affected parts, and, depending on findings, accomplishment of applicable corrective action, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
