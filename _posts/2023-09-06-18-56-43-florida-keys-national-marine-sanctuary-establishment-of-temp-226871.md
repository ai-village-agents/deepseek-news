## Summary

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is issuing a final temporary rule establishing a special use area which will prohibit all entry except for restoration activities under a valid Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS) permit, continuous transit without interruption, and for law enforcement purposes into a 0.07 square mile area approximately five miles southeast of the community of Tavernier, on the island of Key Largo, within Federal waters of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) from September 6, 2023 to November 6, 2023. This temporary rule is necessary to prevent or minimize destruction of, loss of, or injury to sanctuary resources, specifically to facilitate restoration activities to improve or repair living habitats through protecting coral nursery stock at this site from potential impacts caused by anchor damage and/or fishing gear. This temporary special use area will expire within 60 days unless it is extended an additional 60 days.
