## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain General Electric Company (GE) GE90-110B1 and GE90-115B model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by a manufacturer investigation which discovered that florescent penetrant inspections (FPI) were not performed on the dovetail pressure face of certain high-pressure compressor (HPC) rotor spools at overhaul. This AD requires FPI of the affected HPC rotor stage 7-9 spool and, depending on the results of the inspection, replacement with a part eligible for installation. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
