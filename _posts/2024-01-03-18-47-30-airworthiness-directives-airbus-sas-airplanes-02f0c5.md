## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-24- 12, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 airplanes. AD 2020-24-12 required replacing certain center wing box (CWB) fasteners with fasteners having improved friction efficiency. This AD was prompted by reports that certain CWB fasteners had rotated inside the fastener holes due to insufficient friction for the application, and by the determination that additional work is necessary to ensure the correct application of the fuel vapor barrier structure paint on the outside of the CWB. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2020-24-12; and requires the additional work; as specified in European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
