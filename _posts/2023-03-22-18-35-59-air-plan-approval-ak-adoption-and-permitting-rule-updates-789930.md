## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving revisions to the Alaska State Implementation Plan submitted on May 16, 2022, and August 11, 2022. The revisions update Alaska's adoption by reference date for Federal regulations relied upon for implementation of the air program, including permitting requirements and air pollution test methods. The revisions also add procedures for electronic submission of documents for air permits and other authorizations, update air permitting and emission fees, add additional clarifying language to the fee provisions, and specify emissions inventory reporting requirements. The EPA has determined that the submitted revisions are consistent with Clean Air Act requirements.
