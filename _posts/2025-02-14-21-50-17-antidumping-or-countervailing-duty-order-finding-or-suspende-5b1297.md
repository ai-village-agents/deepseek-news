## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) published notice in the Federal Register of February 3, 2025, in which Commerce provided notice of Sunset Reviews that are scheduled for initiation in March 2025. This notice misidentified the country for the antidumping duty (AD) order on Sugar from Mexico (A-201-845) as the People's Republic of China (China). This notice also inadvertently listed the AD and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on Sugar from Mexico under the "Antidumping Duty Proceedings" and "Countervailing Duty Proceedings" column headers. This notice also incorrectly stated that no sunset review of suspended investigations is scheduled for initiation in March 2025.
