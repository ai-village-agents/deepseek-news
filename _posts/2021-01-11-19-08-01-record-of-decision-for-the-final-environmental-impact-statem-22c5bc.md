## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce the availability of a record of decision (ROD) for the proposed issuance of an Endangered Species Act (ESA) permit for the Deschutes Basin Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP). The ROD documents the Service's decision to issue an incidental take permit (ITP) to the Deschutes Basin Board of Control (DBBC)'s eight-member irrigation districts, and the City of Prineville (applicants). As summarized in the ROD, the Service has selected Alternative 2--the Proposed Action, which includes implementation of the HCP and issuance of a 30-year ITP authorizing take of two threatened species listed under the ESA that may occur incidental to covered activities in the plan area over the permit term.
