## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-01-09, which applies to certain Stemme AG Model Stemme S 10-VT and Model Stemme S 12 gliders. AD 2022-01-09 requires removing the affected freewheel clutch from service and prohibits the installation of affected parts. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-01-09, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) superseded its mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) to amend the definition of an affected part. This proposed AD would retain the requirements of AD 2022-01-09 for removing the affected freewheel clutch from service and continue to prohibit the installation of an affected part, and would amend the definition of an affected part and clarify the part installation prohibition. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
