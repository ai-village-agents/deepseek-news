## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing Revision 2 to Regulatory Guide (RG), 1.61, "Damping Values for Seismic Design of Nuclear Power Plants." This RG provides guidance on damping values that the NRC staff finds acceptable for use in the seismic response analysis of seismic Category I nuclear power plant structures, systems, and components. The specified damping values are intended for elastic dynamic seismic analysis where energy dissipation is accounted for by viscous damping.
