## Summary

The Rural Housing Service, Rural Business-Cooperative Service, and Rural Utilities Service, agencies in the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development Mission area, are issuing a final rule to implement the exclusion of certain populations from the definition of "Rural area." The rule updates the definition of "Rural area" for every Rural Development program using the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (CONAct) definition to conform to the revision to the statutory definition in the 2018 Farm Bill.
