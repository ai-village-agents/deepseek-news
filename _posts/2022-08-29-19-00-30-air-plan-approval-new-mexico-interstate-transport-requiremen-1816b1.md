## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of New Mexico, through the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED), for the purpose of addressing the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act") "good neighbor" interstate transport (prongs 1 and 2) infrastructure SIP requirements for the 2010 1-hour Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<INF>2</INF>) National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). Specifically, the EPA is approving New Mexico's June 25, 2021, SIP revision that address prongs 1 and 2 to ensure that air emissions in the State do not significantly contribute to nonattainment or interfere with the maintenance of the 2010 1-hour NO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS in any other state. The EPA is approving this action pursuant to section 110 and part D of the CAA and the EPA's regulations.
