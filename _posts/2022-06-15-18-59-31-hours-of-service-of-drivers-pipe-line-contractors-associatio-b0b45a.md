## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to deny the exemption request from the Pipe Line Contractors Association (PLCA). The PLCA sought an exemption from certain hours-of-service (HOS) regulations for drivers of a variety of commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) employed by its member companies. The PLCA specifically sought an exemption from (1) the requirement of the short-haul exception that drivers return to the work reporting location from which they started the day; (2) the requirement that drivers use electronic logging devices (ELDs) if they must complete a record of duty status (RODS) on more than 8 days in any 30- day period; and (3) the prohibition on driving after having been on duty for 70 hours in 8 consecutive days. The PLCA also requested that CMV drivers used exclusively in the construction and servicing of pipelines be allowed the same HOS exceptions currently available for oilfield operations. FMCSA analyzed the exemption application and public comments, and determined that the application lacked evidence that would ensure a level of safety equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent such exemption.
