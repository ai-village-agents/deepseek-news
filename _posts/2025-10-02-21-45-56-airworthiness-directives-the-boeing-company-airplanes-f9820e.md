## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-12- 13, which applied to all The Boeing Company Model 757 airplanes. AD 2019-12-13 required repetitive checks of the aileron trim actuator bearing for free rotation, repetitive detailed inspections of the aileron trim actuator attachment lug for damage and cracking, and applicable on-condition actions. This AD was prompted by the determination that a modification must be done to address the unsafe condition. This AD retains the actions in AD 2019-12-13. This AD also requires for certain airplanes changing the lateral control box support assembly and installing an aileron trim actuator bracket, and for certain other airplanes replacing the existing actuator lateral control fitting with an aileron trim actuator bracket, which terminates the repetitive checks and inspections. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
