## Summary

The Assistant Regional Administrator for Sustainable Fisheries, Greater Atlantic Region, NMFS, has made a preliminary determination that an application submitted by the Cape Cod Commercial Fishermen's Alliance to revise an existing Exempted Fishing Permit contains all of the required information and warrants further consideration. The revised Exempted Fishing Permit would allow two commercial fishing vessels participating in an electronic monitoring program to fish with benthic longline gear in portions of the Cashes Ledge Closure Area. Regulations under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act require publication of this notice to provide interested parties the opportunity to comment on applications for proposed Exempted Fishing Permits.
