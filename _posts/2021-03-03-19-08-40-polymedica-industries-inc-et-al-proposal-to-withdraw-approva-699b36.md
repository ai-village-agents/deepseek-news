The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA or Agency) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) is proposing to withdraw approval of three new drug applications (NDAs) and is announcing an opportunity for the NDA holders to request a hearing on this proposal. The basis for the proposal is that the NDA holders have repeatedly failed to file required annual reports for those NDAs.
