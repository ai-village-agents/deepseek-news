## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FMCSA announces its plan to submit the Information Collection Request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review and approval and invites public comment. This ICR relates to the planned "Study of Commercial Motor Vehicle Crash Causation," mandated by Congress in the Infrastructure and Investment Jobs Act (IIJA). To plan and execute this study, FMCSA must collect information from the States and local jurisdictions to understand their interest or ability to participate in the study. FMCSA will collect information on existing crash data collection processes, systems, and resources and commercial motor vehicle (CMV) enforcement funding mechanisms and sources.
