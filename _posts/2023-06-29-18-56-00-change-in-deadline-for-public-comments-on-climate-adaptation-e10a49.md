## Summary

On May 2, 2023, the International Trade Administration (ITA) and the U.S. Agency Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) published in the Federal Register a request for public comment on climate adaptation and resilience-related technologies and services to enhance the U.S. government's understanding of opportunities and challenges for U.S. exporters in these sectors. ITA and USTDA have determined that an extension of the comment period until July 28, 2023, is appropriate. Comments previously submitted need not be resubmitted and will be fully considered.
