## Summary

NMFS proposes to approve and implement measures included in Amendment 21 to the Atlantic Mackerel, Squid, and Butterfish Fishery Management Plan, as submitted by the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council. This action would integrate Atlantic chub mackerel as a stock in the fishery under the Atlantic Mackerel, Squid, and Butterfish Fishery Management Plan. This amendment would identify goals and objectives for managing Atlantic chub mackerel; specify status determination criteria; designate essential fish habitat; establish a specifications process; set annual catch limits for 2020-2022; and implement accountability measures, possession limits, permitting and reporting requirements, and other administrative measures for Atlantic chub mackerel caught from Maine through North Carolina.
