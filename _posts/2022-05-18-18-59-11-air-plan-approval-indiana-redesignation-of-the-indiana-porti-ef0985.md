## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to find that the Indiana portion of the Louisville, Indiana-Kentucky area (Area) is attaining the 2015 primary and secondary ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), and to act in accordance with a request from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) to redesignate the Indiana portion of the area to attainment for the 2015 ozone NAAQS because the request meets the statutory requirements for redesignation under the Clean Air Act (CAA). The Area includes Clark and Floyd Counties in Indiana and Bullitt, Jefferson, and Oldham Counties in Kentucky. IDEM submitted this request on February 21, 2022. EPA is proposing to approve, as a revision to the Indiana State Implementation Plan (SIP), the State's plan for maintaining the 2015 ozone NAAQS through 2035 in the Indiana portion of the Louisville area. EPA finds adequate and is proposing to approve Indiana's 2035 volatile organic compound (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) Motor Vehicle Emission Budgets (budgets) for the Indiana portion of the Louisville area and is initiating the adequacy review process for these budgets. Finally, EPA is also proposing to approve portions of a separate January 21, 2021 submittal from IDEM as meeting the applicable requirements for a base year emissions inventory and emissions statement program.
