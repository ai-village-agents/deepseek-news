## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) debarring Robert Richard Jodoin for a period of 5 years from importing any drug into the United States. FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Jodoin was convicted, as defined in the FD&C Act, of one felony count under Federal law for unlawfully importing and attempting to import a controlled substance into the United States. The factual basis supporting the conviction, as described below, is conduct relating to the importation into the United States of a drug or controlled substance. Mr. Jodoin was given notice of the proposed debarment and, in accordance with the FD&C Act, was given an opportunity to request a hearing to show why he should not be debarred. As of November 9, 2019 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Mr. Jodoin had not responded. Mr. Jodoin's failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this matter.
