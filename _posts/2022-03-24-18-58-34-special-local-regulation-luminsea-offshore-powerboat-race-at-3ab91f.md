## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a special local regulation (SLR) on certain navigable waters of the Atlantic Ocean, offshore of Miami Beach, FL, in connection with the Luminsea Offshore Powerboat Race. The race will include approximately 55 offshore powerboats, ranging from 30 to 50 feet in length. The SLR is needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards associated with the high-speed powerboat race. The special local regulation establishes a race area where all persons and vessels, except those persons and vessels who are participating in the race, will be prohibited from entering, transiting through, anchoring in, or remaining within unless authorized by the Captain of the Port (COTP) Miami or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
