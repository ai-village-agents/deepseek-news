## Summary

This final rule amends NHTSA's regulations regarding exemptions to the make inoperative prohibition to accommodate disabilities to include new exemptions relating to the Federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSS) for roof crush resistance, rear visibility, and air bags. The air bag provision permits rental car companies to make inoperative a knee bolster air bag, on a temporary basis, to permit the temporary installation of hand controls to accommodate persons with physical disabilities seeking to rent the vehicle. We have drafted this rule to facilitate the mobility of drivers and passengers with physical disabilities in a manner that balances safety and accessibility. This rulemaking responds to a petition for rulemaking from the National Mobility Equipment Dealers Association and from Bruno Independent Living Aids, Inc., and to an inquiry from Enterprise Holdings Co.
