## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd. & Co KG Trent 1000-A2, Trent 1000- AE2, Trent 1000-C2, Trent 1000-CE2, Trent 1000-D2, Trent 1000-E2, Trent 1000-G2, Trent 1000-H2, Trent 1000-J2, Trent 1000-K2, and Trent 1000-L2 model turbofan engines. This proposed AD was prompted by the manufacturer revising the engine Time Limits Manual (TLM) life limits of certain critical rotating parts and direct accumulation counting (DAC) data files. This proposed AD would require operators to revise the airworthiness limitation section (ALS) of their approved maintenance program by incorporating the revised tasks of the applicable TLM for each affected engine model. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
