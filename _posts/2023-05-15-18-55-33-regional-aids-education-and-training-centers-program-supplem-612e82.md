## Summary

HRSA will provide supplemental funding to UMass, a current Regional AETC Program award recipient, for a 1-year period of performance and 1-year budget period to support a program designed to train internal and family medicine residents to specialize in HIV treatment and care management. This training program is critically needed, as it will help increase the number of primary HIV care providers available to diagnose, treat, and medically manage people with HIV and address urgent needs stemming from the HIV care workforce shortage.
