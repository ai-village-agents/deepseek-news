## Summary

On January 20, 2021, President Biden issued a memorandum to the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) directing the Secretary to reinstate Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) for eligible Liberians, and to provide for continued work authorization through June 30, 2022. Eligible Liberian nationals (and persons without nationality who last habitually resided in Liberia) covered under DED as of January 10, 2021 may remain in the United States through June 30, 2022. This notice extends through June 30, 2022 employment authorization for Liberians covered under DED and also automatically extends DED-related Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) for those who already have an EAD with a printed expiration date of March 30, 2020 or January 10, 2021. The reinstatement of DED for Liberians is intended to allow additional time for eligible Liberians to apply for adjustment of status on or before December 20, 2021 under the extension of the Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness (LRIF) provision in section 901 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. Liberians who apply for adjustment of status under LRIF may immediately apply for employment authorization consistent with that provision.
