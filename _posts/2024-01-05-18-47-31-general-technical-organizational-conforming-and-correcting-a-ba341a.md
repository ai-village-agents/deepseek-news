## Summary

In a final rule published in the Federal Register on November 17, 2023, FMCSA amended its regulations by making technical corrections throughout the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs). The final rule had an incorrect paragraph number in the instruction for an amendment and, in an amendment replacing a term, erroneously failed to replace the possessive form of the term. The Agency corrects these errors.
