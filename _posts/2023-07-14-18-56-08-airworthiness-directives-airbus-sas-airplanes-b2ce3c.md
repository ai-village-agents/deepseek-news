## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-18-09, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A319-111, -112, - 113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133; A320-211, -212, -214, -216, - 231, -232, -233, -251N, and -271N; and A321-111, -112, -131, -211, - 212, -213, -231, -232, -251N, and -253N airplanes. AD 2022-18-09 continues to require the actions in AD 2019-26-01 and AD 2021-23-15, and adds airplanes to the applicability. Since the FAA issued AD 2022- 18-09, it was determined that additional airplanes and galleys are subject to the unsafe condition, and a compliance time for certain airplanes should be extended. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2022-18-09 and would require expanding the applicability, obtaining and following additional instructions for certain modified airplanes, and extending the compliance time for certain airplanes, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
