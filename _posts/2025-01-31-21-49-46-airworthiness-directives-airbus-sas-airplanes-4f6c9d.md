## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, -133, - 151N, and -153N airplanes; A320 series airplanes; and A321-211, -212, - 213, -231, -232, -251N, -252N, -253N, -271N, -272N, -251NX, -252NX, - 253NX, -271NX, and -272NX airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that a damage-tolerance and fatigue reassessment of nose landing gear (NLG) repairs is necessary for certain parts fitted on airplanes approved for operation in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). This AD requires repair and replacement of all affected parts, and introduces restrictions for the installation of affected parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
