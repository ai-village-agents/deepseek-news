## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing a 60- day public comment period on the draft revision of the Technical Guidance for Assessing Environmental Justice in Regulatory Analysis (EJ Technical Guidance). The EJ Technical Guidance was first published in 2016. The EPA is updating it to reflect the state of the science; new peer-reviewed agency guidance; and new terminology, priorities, and direction, including Executive Order 14096. The purpose of this guidance is to outline analytic expectations and discuss technical approaches and methods that can be used by agency analysts to evaluate EJ concerns for regulatory actions. This technical guidance builds on the EPA's experience in evaluating environmental justice concerns within the rulemaking analytic process and underscores the EPA's ongoing commitment to ensuring the just treatment and meaningful involvement of all people with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies.
