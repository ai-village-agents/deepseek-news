## Summary

NMFS implements an accountability measure (AM) for commercial Spanish mackerel in the northern zone of the Atlantic exclusive economic zone (EEZ). NMFS projects that the commercial quota for Spanish mackerel in the northern zone of the Atlantic EEZ has been reached. Therefore, NMFS closes the northern zone for commercial harvest of Spanish mackerel to protect the Spanish mackerel resource in the Atlantic.
