## Summary

This notice announces that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has forwarded the Information Collection Request (ICR), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number 1652-0056, abstracted below, to OMB for review and approval of a revision of the currently approved collection under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected burden. This collection combines TSA's voluntary Pipeline Corporate Security Review (PCSR) program with the mandatory requirements under the TSA Security Directive (SD) Pipeline-2021-02 series. The collection allows TSA to assess the current security practices in the pipeline industry through TSA's PCSR program, which is part of the larger domain awareness, prevention, and protection program supporting TSA's and the Department of Homeland Security's missions. The collection also allows for the continued institution of mandatory cybersecurity requirements under the TSA SD Pipeline-2021-02 series. The updated ICR reflects changes to collection requirements based on TSA's update to the SD Pipline-2021-02 series, released on July 21, 2022.
