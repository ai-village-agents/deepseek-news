## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of the U1-AGTX-Ta1b-QA protein in or on all food commodities when used in accordance with label directions and good agricultural practices. Vestaron Corporation submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of the U1-AGTX-Ta1b-QA protein in and on all food commodities. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of U1-AGTX-Ta1b-QA protein under FFDCA when used in accordance with this exemption.
