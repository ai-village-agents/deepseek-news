## Summary

This rule streamlines defense trade and facilitates cooperation among our allies while reducing the regulatory burden for exporters, in support of the President's Executive Order 14268 of April 9, 2025, "Reforming Foreign Defense Sales to Improve Speed and Accountability". In this rule the Department of State (the Department) finalizes, with changes, the interim final rule published on August 20, 2024. The interim final rule made several amendments to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), pursuant to section 38(l) of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), to facilitate defense trade and cooperation among Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, including through a new exemption to the licensing requirements of the ITAR. The Department is also now responding to public comments received on the interim final rule.
