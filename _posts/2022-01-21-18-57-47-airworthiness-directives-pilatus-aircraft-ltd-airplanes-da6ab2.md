## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Pilatus Aircraft Ltd. (Pilatus) Model PC-24 airplanes. This AD was prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI describes the unsafe condition as insufficient performance of the fuel drain system that could lead to fire and damage of the airplane. This AD requires modifying the fuel drain pipe routing and installing a drain mast. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
