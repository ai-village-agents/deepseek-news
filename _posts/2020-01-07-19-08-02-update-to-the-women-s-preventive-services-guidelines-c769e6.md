## Summary

On December 17, 2019, HRSA approved an update to the HRSA- supported Women's Preventive Services Guidelines (Guidelines) that addresses health needs specific to women. The Guidelines are based on clinical recommendations from the Women's Preventive Services Initiative. Preventive care and screenings for women provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by HRSA are required to be covered without cost-sharing by non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance issuers offering non-grandfathered group or individual health insurance coverage. This 2019 update adds one additional service--Screening for Anxiety--to the HRSA-supported Women's Preventive Services Guidelines to the 11 preventive services that were last updated in 2017. The 11 services included in the 2017 update are: Breast Cancer Screening for Average Risk Women, Breastfeeding Services and Supplies, Screening for Cervical Cancer, Contraception, Screening for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus, Screening for Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection, Screening for Interpersonal and Domestic Violence, Counseling for Sexually Transmitted Infections, Well-Woman Preventive Visits, Screening for Diabetes Mellitus after Pregnancy, and Screening for Urinary Incontinence. This notice serves as an announcement of the decision to update the guidelines as listed below. Please see https:// www.hrsa.gov/womens-guidelines/index.html for additional information.
