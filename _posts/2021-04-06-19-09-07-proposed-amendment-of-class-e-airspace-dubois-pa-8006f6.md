## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Dubois Regional Airport, Dubois, PA. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of an airspace review caused by the decommissioning of the Clarion VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) navigation aids as part of the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program. The name for the Penn Highlands Healthcare-Dubois Heliport would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
