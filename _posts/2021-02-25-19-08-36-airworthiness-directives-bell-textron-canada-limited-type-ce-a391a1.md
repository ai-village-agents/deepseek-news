## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bell Textron Canada Limited (type certificate previously held by Bell Helicopter Textron Canada Limited) Model 429 helicopters. This AD was prompted by the introduction of a new life limit for the centrifugal force bearing (CFB). This AD requires determining the accumulated retirement index number (RIN) and removing each affected CFB from service before it accumulates 8,000 total RIN. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
