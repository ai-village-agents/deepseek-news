## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to change the operating schedule that governs the Welch Causeway (SR 699) Bridge, mile 122.8 at Madeira Beach, Florida. A request was made by the City of Madeira Beach, FL to place the drawbridge on a daily operating schedule to alleviate vehicle congestion due to on demand bridge openings. This change may be necessary to balance the needs of all modes of transportion due to the economic growth in the vicinity of the bridge. The Coast Guard is seeking comments from the public regarding these proposed changes.
