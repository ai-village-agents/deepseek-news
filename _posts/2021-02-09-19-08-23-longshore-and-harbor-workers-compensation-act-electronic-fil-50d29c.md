## Summary

On December 14, 2020, the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) published a direct final rule in the Federal Register revising regulations governing electronic filing and settlements, and establishing new procedures for assessing and adjudicating penalties under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA). Consistent with the Presidential directive as expressed in the memorandum of January 20, 2021, from the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff, entitled "Regulatory Freeze Pending Review," OWCP is withdrawing the direct final rule.
