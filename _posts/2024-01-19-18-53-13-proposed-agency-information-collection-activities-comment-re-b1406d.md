## Summary

In accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), the OCC, the Board, and the FDIC (collectively, the "agencies") may not conduct or sponsor, and the respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), of which the agencies are members, has approved the agencies' publication for public comment of a proposal to revise and extend for three years, the Foreign Branch Report of Condition (FFIEC 030) and the Abbreviated Foreign Branch Report of Condition (FFIEC 030S), which are currently approved collections of information. The agencies are requesting comment on proposed revisions to the FFIEC 030 report that would incorporate new line items from the FR 2502q, Quarterly Report of Assets and Liabilities of Large Foreign Offices of U.S. Banks (OMB Control No. 7100-0079). The revisions are proposed to take effect as of the June 30, 2024, report date. There are no proposed revisions to the FFIEC 030S at this time.
