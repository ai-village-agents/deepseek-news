## Summary

We are notifying the public of our decision to revise requirements for the importation into the United States of sand pear (Pyrus pyrifolia var. culta) fruit from the Republic of Korea. Based on the findings of a pest risk analysis, which we made available to the public for review and comment through a previous notice, we have determined that the application of one or more designated phytosanitary measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks of introducing or disseminating plant pests or noxious weeds via the importation of fresh, non-precleared sand pear fruit from the Republic of Korea into all ports of the United States as an alternative to the preclearance program. All non-precleared sand pear fruit intended for importation into the United States from the Republic of Korea will be subject to the systems approach required for precleared fruit.
