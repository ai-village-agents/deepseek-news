# Atlantic Highly Migratory Species; Gear Considerations

## Summary

NMFS announces the availability of a scoping document to consider changes to gear regulations and requirements in fisheries targeting Atlantic highly migratory species (HMS). While management measures implemented since 1999 have helped achieve fishery management and conservation goals, the combination of over two decades of gear- specific measures may have had unanticipated consequences. Changes in species distribution, fishing gears, fishing techniques, market conditions, and fishing interests may warrant a reexamination of some gear-specific management measures to see if they are still meeting applicable goals. NMFS requests comments on the options presented in the scoping document as well as additional ideas that may warrant consideration.
