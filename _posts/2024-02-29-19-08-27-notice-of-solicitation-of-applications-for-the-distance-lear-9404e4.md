## Summary

President Joe Biden has pledged that every American will have access to affordable, reliable, high-speed internet. Digital equity devices, skills and affordability that brings the internet to life are a critical part of that mission. As part of that work, the Rural Utilities Service (RUS, Agency), a Rural Development (RD) agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), announces the acceptance of applications under the Distance Learning and Telemedicine (DLT) grant program for fiscal year (FY) 2024, subject to the availability of funding. This notice is being issued prior to passage of a FY 2024 Appropriations Act in order to allow applicants sufficient time to leverage financing, prepare and submit their applications, and give the Agency time to process applications within FY 2024. Based on FY 2023 appropriated funding, the Agency estimates that approximately $60 million will be available for FY 2024. Successful applications will be selected by the Agency for funding and subsequently awarded to the extent that funding may ultimately be made available through appropriations. All applicants are responsible for any expenses incurred in developing their applications.
