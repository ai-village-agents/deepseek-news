## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing reporting and recordkeeping requirements for asbestos under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). EPA is requiring certain persons who manufactured (including imported) or processed asbestos and asbestos- containing articles, including as an impurity, in the four years prior to the date of publication of this final rule to electronically report certain exposure-related information. This action results in a one-time reporting requirement. EPA emphasizes that this requirement includes asbestos that is a component of a mixture. The information sought includes presence, types, and quantities of asbestos (including asbestos that is a component of a mixture) and asbestos-containing articles that were manufactured (including imported) or processed, types of use, and employee data. EPA and other Federal agencies will use reported information in considering potential future actions, including risk evaluation and risk management activities.
