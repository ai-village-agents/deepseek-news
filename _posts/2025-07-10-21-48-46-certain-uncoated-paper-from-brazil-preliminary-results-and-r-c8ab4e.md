## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping duty (AD) order on certain uncoated paper (uncoated paper) from Brazil for the period of review (POR) March 1, 2023, through February 29, 2024. Commerce preliminarily finds that Suzano S.A. (Suzano) made sales of subject merchandise at prices below normal value (NV) during the POR. Additionally, we are rescinding this administrative review, in part, with respect to one company, Sylvamo do Brasil Ltda. and Sylvamo Exports Ltda. (collectively, Sylvamo) as it had no reviewable entries of subject merchandise during the POR. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.
