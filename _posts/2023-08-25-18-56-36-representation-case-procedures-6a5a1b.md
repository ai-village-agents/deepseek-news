# Representation-Case Procedures

## Summary

The National Labor Relations Board has decided to issue this final rule for the purpose of carrying out the National Labor Relations Act, which protects the exercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or other mutual aid or protection. While retaining the essentials of existing representation case procedures, this rule substantially rescinds the amendments made by a rule the Board promulgated in 2019 (which has been the subject of ongoing litigation) and thereby substantially returns representation case procedures to those that existed following the Board's promulgation of a rule concerning representation case procedures in 2014 (which was uniformly upheld by the federal courts). By doing so, this rule effectuates what the Board deems to be appropriate policy choices that enhance the fair, efficient, and expeditious resolution of representation cases.
