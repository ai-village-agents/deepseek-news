## Summary

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), Department of Justice (DOJ), will submit the following information collection request to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The information collection (IC) OMB 1140-0040 (Application for Amended Federal Firearms License--ATF F 5300.38) is being revised due to material changes to the form, such as added verbiage, added fill spaces for select questions, check box removal and revised contact information. There is also an increase in the annual cost burden due to the postal rate change since the last renewal in 2019. The proposed information collection is also being published to obtain comments from the public and affected agencies.
