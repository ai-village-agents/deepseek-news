## Summary

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO or Office) is amending the rules of practice in patent cases and the rules regarding the representation of others before the USPTO by creating a separate design patent practitioner bar whereby admitted design patent practitioners would practice in design patent proceedings only. Prior to this rulemaking, there was only one patent bar that applied to those who practice in patent matters before the Office, including in utility, plant, and design patents. The creation of a design patent practitioner bar does not impact the ability of those already registered to practice in any patent matters before the USPTO to continue to practice in any patent matters, including design patent matters, before the Office. Furthermore, it does not impact the ability of applicants for registration who meet the criteria to practice in all patent matters from qualifying for and upon passing the current registration exam, practicing in any patent matters before the Office, including design patent matters. Expanding the admission criteria of the patent bar encourages broader participation and keeps up with the ever-evolving technology and related teachings that qualify someone to practice before the USPTO. The Manual of Patent Examining Procedure will be updated in accordance with this final rule in due course.
