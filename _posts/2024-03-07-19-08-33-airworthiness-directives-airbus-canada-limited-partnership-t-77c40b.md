# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Canada Limited Partnership (Type Certificate Previously Held by C Series Aircraft Limited Partnership (CSALP); Bombardier, Inc.) Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500- 1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of multiple in-service failures of engine feed check valves, which have resulted in fuel imbalance conditions in flight. This proposed AD would require repetitive replacement of the left- and right-side engine feed check valves with new engine feed check valves, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
