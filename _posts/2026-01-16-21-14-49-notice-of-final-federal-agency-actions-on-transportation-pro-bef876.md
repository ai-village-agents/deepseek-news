## Summary

This notice announces actions taken by the FHWA, on behalf of the Nebraska Department of Transportation, that are final. The action(s) relate to the Lincoln West Beltway Project, located in Lancaster County, Nebraska. The project is a subcomponent of a larger project called the "U.S. 77 Lincoln--South Expressway West and East Bypass of Lincoln, Lancaster County, Nebraska". Those actions grant licenses, permits, and approvals for the project. This project converts at-grade intersections along US-77 in the City of Lincoln, NE at Pioneers Boulevard and Warlick Boulevard/West Denton Road to full access interchanges. Access to US-77 at the intersections of Old Cheney Road and Yankee Hill Road will be removed. The FHWA's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Record of Decision (ROD) and subsequent NEPA Re-evaluation provide details on the Selected Alternative for the proposed improvements.
