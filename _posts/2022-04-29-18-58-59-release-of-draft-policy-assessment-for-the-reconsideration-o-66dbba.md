## Summary

On or about April 28, 2022, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is making available to the public a draft document titled, Policy Assessment for the Reconsideration of the Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards, External Review Draft (Draft PA). This draft document was prepared as a part of the current reconsideration of the 2020 final decision on the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for ozone (O<INF>3</INF>). When final, the PA is intended to "bridge the gap" between the scientific and technical information assessed in the 2020 Integrated Science Assessment for Ozone and Related Photochemical Oxidants (2020 ISA), as well as any air quality, exposure and risk analyses available in the reconsideration, and the judgments required of the Administrator. The primary and secondary O<INF>3</INF> NAAQS are set to protect the public health and the public welfare from O<INF>3</INF> and other photochemical oxidants in ambient air.
