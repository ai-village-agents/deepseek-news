## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves the member of the public that may submit an Alternative Methods of Compliance (AMOC) request to the FAA by using the Airworthiness Directives Development (ADD) External website. The information to be collected will be used to support publicly disseminated information to the FAA and/or is necessary because this information supports the Department of Transpiration's strategic goal to promote the public health and safety by working toward eliminating transportation-related deaths and injuries.
