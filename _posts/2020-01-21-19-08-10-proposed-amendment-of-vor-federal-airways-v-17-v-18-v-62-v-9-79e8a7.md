## Summary

This action proposes to amend six VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways, V-17, V-18, V-62, V-94, V-163, and V-568, in the vicinity of Glen Rose, TX. The modifications are necessary due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Glen Rose, TX, VOR/ Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) navigation aid (NAVAID), which provides navigation guidance for portions of the affected air traffic service (ATS) routes. The Glen Rose VOR is being decommissioned as part of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
