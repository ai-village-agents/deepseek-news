## Summary

The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), maintains controls on the export, reexport and transfer (in-country) of dual-use items and less sensitive military items pursuant to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Certain instruments for the automated synthesis of peptides (automated peptide synthesizers) have been identified by BIS as a Section 1758 emerging and foundational technology. In this rule, BIS proposes controls for these automated peptide synthesizers. BIS is seeking public comments on the proposed controls, detailed below.
