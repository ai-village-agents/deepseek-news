## Summary

The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) is amending the procedures for Submission of Gaming Ordinance or Resolution under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. The amendment revises the regulations controlling the submission and approval requirements of tribal gaming ordinances or resolutions and amendments thereof. Notably, the rule: authorizes the submission of documents in electronic or physical form; clarifies that the submission requirements apply to amendments of ordinances or resolutions; eliminates the requirement that an Indian tribe provide copies of all gaming regulations with its submission and instead requires a tribe to submit gaming regulations only upon request; initiates the 90-day deadline for the NIGC Chair ruling upon receipt of a complete submission; requires tribes that subsequently amend a gaming ordinance pending before the Chair to provide an authentic resolution withdrawing the pending submission and resubmitting the revised submission; and eliminates the requirement that the NIGC Chair publish a tribe's entire gaming ordinance in the Federal Register, requiring notice of approval to be published with the Chair's approval letter instead. In addition, the NIGC has made other non-substantive revisions, such as citation to cross references, minor grammatical revisions, and formatting changes.
