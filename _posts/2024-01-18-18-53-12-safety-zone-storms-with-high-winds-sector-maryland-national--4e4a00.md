## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a safety zone for the navigable waters of the Sector Maryland-National Capital Region Captain of the Port (COTP) Zone, to be enforced whenever hurricanes, tropical storms, and other storms with high winds are expected. This action is taken to ensure the safety of these waters. It would establish actions to be completed by industry and vessels within the Zone, both in anticipation of hurricanes, tropical storms, and other severe high wind weather events threatening the State of Maryland, and after landfall.
