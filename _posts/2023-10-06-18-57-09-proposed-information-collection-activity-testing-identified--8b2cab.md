## Summary

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation (OPRE) launched the Testing Identified Elements for Success in Fatherhood Programs (Fatherhood TIES) project in 2022. Using a mix of research methods, this study will identify and test the "core components" of fatherhood programs in any effort to identify which core components are most effective at improving the lives of fathers who participate in fatherhood programs and their children. The study will ultimately include an implementation and an impact study.
