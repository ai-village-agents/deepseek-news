## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Tennessee through the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC), through a letter dated June 1, 2021. The SIP submittal proposes to revise SIP requirements regarding the installation, maintenance, and termination of ambient air sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) monitors near large industrial SO<INF>2</INF> emitting sources in the State. EPA is proposing to approve these changes to the Tennessee Air Pollution Control Regulations (TAPCR) related to the control of SO<INF>2</INF> emissions into the SIP because they are consistent with the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act).
