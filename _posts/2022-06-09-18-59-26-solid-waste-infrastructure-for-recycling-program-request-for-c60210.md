## Summary

EPA's Office of Land and Emergency Management (OLEM) is developing and implementing several new programs as directed by the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), also referred to as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This action provides the public with the opportunity to share information to inform the development of the Solid Waste Infrastructure for Recycling (SWIFR) grant program, which will fund improvements to local post-consumer materials management including municipal recycling programs and assist local waste management authorities in making improvements to local waste management systems. OLEM is seeking information from a broad array of stakeholders about needed improvements to solid waste management systems (e.g., waste reduction, collection, sorting, processing, and end-markets for reuse and recycling), including but not limited to industry, researchers, academia, state, tribal, and local governments including U.S. territories and the District of Columbia, other federal agencies, community groups, non-governmental organizations, the public, and international organizations.
