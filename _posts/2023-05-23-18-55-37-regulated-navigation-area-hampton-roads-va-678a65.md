## Summary

The Coast Guard is amending the Chesapeake Bay entrance and Hampton Roads, VA and adjacent waters--Regulated Navigation Area. Officially codified in 2003, the need for this review and update of the Regulated Navigation Area has been prompted by changes in the organizational structure, responsibilities and shipboard requirements over the last 20 years. The Coast Guard is removing outdated or redundant language and requirements, including those related to port security. This action will provide administrative changes and amend vessel reporting requirements operating within the Regulated Navigation Area during Maritime Security Level 1.
