## Summary

The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) Part A and B funding formulas are defined by the Public Health Service (PHS) Act and rely on the living HIV/AIDS cases reported to and confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Advancements in HIV surveillance have improved the mapping of the epidemic, leading to better care strategies. Since 2017, CDC has shifted to using the most recent addresses of people with HIV for reporting, raising questions about whether RWHAP funds follow clients or remain in the jurisdiction of diagnosis. HRSA has analyzed the effects of this updated methodology on formula funding and is now seeking public feedback on proposed changes to better direct resources to where clients currently live and receive care.
