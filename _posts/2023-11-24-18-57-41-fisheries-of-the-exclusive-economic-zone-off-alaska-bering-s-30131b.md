## Summary

NMFS issues this final rule to implement Amendment 123 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) Management Area (BSAI FMP). This final rule amends the regulations governing limits on Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) (halibut) prohibited species catch (PSC) to link the halibut PSC limit for the Amendment 80 commercial groundfish trawl fleet in the BSAI groundfish fisheries to halibut abundance. This final rule is necessary to comply with the obligation in the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act) that FMPs minimize bycatch to the extent practicable. It is also consistent with the Magnuson-Stevens Act's National Standards. This final rule is expected to minimize halibut mortality, and it may result in additional harvest opportunities in the commercial halibut fishery, as well as to the subsistence and recreational fisheries. This final rule is intended to promote the goals and objectives of the Magnuson- Stevens Act, other applicable laws, and Amendment 123 to the BSAI FMP.
