## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of New Mexico, through New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) dated June 25, 2021, for the purpose of addressing the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act") "good neighbor" interstate transport (prongs 1 and 2) infrastructure SIP requirements for the 2010 1-hour Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<INF>2</INF>) National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). The CAA requires that each state adopt and submit a SIP for the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of each NAAQS promulgated by the EPA, commonly referred to as an "infrastructure SIP." Specifically, the EPA is proposing to approve New Mexico's June 25, 2021, SIP revision addressing prongs 1 and 2 to ensure that air emissions in the State do not significantly contribute to nonattainment or interfere with maintenance of the 2010 1-hour NO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS in any other state. The EPA is proposing to approve this action pursuant to section 110 and part D of the CAA and the EPA's regulations.
