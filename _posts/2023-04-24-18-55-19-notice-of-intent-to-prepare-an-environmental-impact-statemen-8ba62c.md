## Summary

In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (NEPA), and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, as amended (FLPMA), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Carson City District Office intends to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to consider the effects of the proposed Libra Solar Project and by this notice is announcing the beginning of the scoping period to solicit public comments and identify issues, and is providing the planning criteria for public review. Through this notice the BLM is also announcing the segregation of public lands included in the right- of-way application for the Libra Solar Project from appropriation under the public land laws, including the Mining Law, but not the Mineral Leasing or Material Sales Acts, for a period of two (2) years from the date of publication of this notice, subject to valid existing rights. This segregation is to facilitate the orderly administration of the public lands while the BLM considers potential solar development on the described parcel.
