## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District (SJVUAPCD or "District") portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) concerning a rule submitted to address section 185 of the Clean Air Act (CAA or the "Act") with respect to the revoked 1997 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS or "standard"). We are proposing action on this local rule that was submitted as an equivalent alternative to a statutory section 185 program. We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
