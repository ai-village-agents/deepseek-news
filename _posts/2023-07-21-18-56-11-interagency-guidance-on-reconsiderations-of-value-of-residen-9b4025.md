## Summary

The Board, CFPB, FDIC, NCUA, and OCC (together, the agencies) are issuing proposed guidance that would highlight risks associated with deficient residential real estate valuations and describe how financial institutions may incorporate reconsiderations of value (ROV) processes and controls into established risk management functions. The proposed guidance would also highlight examples of policies and procedures that a financial institution may choose to establish to help identify, address, and mitigate the risk of discrimination impacting residential real estate valuations.
