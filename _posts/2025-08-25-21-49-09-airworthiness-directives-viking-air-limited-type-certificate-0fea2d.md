## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-23- 08, which applied to all Viking Air Limited (Viking) Model DHC-3 airplanes. AD 2022-23-08 required a visual inspection of the stabilizer actuator to confirm that the stabilizer actuator lock ring is present, correctly seated in the groove in the upper housing, and engaged in the clamp nut, applicable corrective actions, application of a torque seal, and sending the inspection results to the FAA. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-23-08, Transport Canada, which is the aviation authority for Canada, issued mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) to address the unsafe condition identified as a missing stabilizer actuator lock ring. This AD requires repetitively inspecting the stabilizer actuator to confirm that the stabilizer actuator lock ring is present, correctly seated in the groove in the upper housing, and engaged in the clamp nut; taking applicable corrective actions; applying a witness mark (torque seal); and installing a secondary retention feature as terminating action for the repetitive inspections. This AD also prohibits installing any stabilizer actuator unless it is a serviceable part. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
