## Summary

On January 15, 2020, HUD published a proposed rule in the Federal Register inviting public comment on amendments to HUD's Fair Housing Act design and construction regulations. The January 15, 2020, proposed rule set March 16, 2020, as the comment due date. Because the proposed rule referred to documents that were not readily available, HUD is extending the public comment period for an additional 30-day period and making the referenced documents available through its website as described in this document.
