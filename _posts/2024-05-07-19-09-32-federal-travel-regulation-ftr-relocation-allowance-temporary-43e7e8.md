## Summary

The United States (U.S.) General Services Administration (GSA) is issuing a final rule amending the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) with respect to temporary quarters subsistence expenses (TQSE) allowances. Changes include implementing a third TQSE methodology, redefining the current TQSE methods, lowering the percentage multipliers for calculating TQSE maximum daily amounts, and prohibiting adjustments to TQSE percentage multipliers for househunting days. The final rule also exempts temporary quarters (TQ) located in Presidentially-Declared Disaster areas from the "reasonable proximity" requirement and allows agencies to authorize TQSE at the applicable locality per diem allowance or authorize actual expenses on an individual basis. This rule establishes an exception to authorizing actual expenses on an individual basis by which agencies can issue a blanket actual expense authorization for employees authorized to occupy TQ in Presidentially-Declared Disaster areas. The final rule will also update and clarify some TQSE sections and rearrange them into a more sequential order.
