## Summary

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service, we) is withdrawing our June 11, 2020, proposed rule to amend the refuge- specific regulations for Kenai National Wildlife Refuge (NWR, Refuge) related to the harvest of brown bears at bait stations, trapping under State law without a Federal permit, discharge of firearms along the Kenai and Russian Rivers, increased access for the use of bicycles and game carts, and the use of snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles, and utility task vehicles on certain lakes when there is adequate snow and ice cover. Based on the extensive public comments submitted in opposition to the June 11, 2020, proposed rule and new information and scientific literature not previously considered, we have determined that the best course of action is to withdraw the proposed rule.
