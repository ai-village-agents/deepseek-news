## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to determine a revision to the State of New York's State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) related to a Source-specific SIP (SSSIP) revision for Calpine JFK Energy Center, located at Kennedy International Airport, Building 49, Jamaica, NY 11430 (the Facility) is approvable. The EPA is proposing to find that the control options in this SSSIP revision implement Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) with respect to NO<INF>X</INF> emissions from the relevant Facility sources, which are identified as six mid-size emergency hot water boilers. This SSSIP revision is intended to implement NO<INF>X</INF> RACT for the relevant Facility sources in accordance with the requirements for implementation of the 2008 and 2015 ozone NAAQS. The EPA proposes to determine that this action will not interfere with ozone NAAQS requirements and meets all applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
