## Summary

The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) received notice that the vendor contracted to provide printing services to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) experienced staffing and equipment issues that resulted in a significant delay in the printing and mailing of benefit letters. To protect the interests of Veterans and other claimants affected by this delay, VBA is instituting temporary guidance extending a grace period on responses to time-sensitive letter notifications.
