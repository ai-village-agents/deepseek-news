## Summary

As part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, FinCEN invites comments on the proposed renewal, without change, of a currently approved information collection found in existing Bank Secrecy Act regulations. Specifically, the regulations require casinos to secure and maintain a record of the name, permanent address, and social security number of each person who deposits funds or opens an account at the casino, or to whom the casino extends a line of credit. The regulations also require that casinos retain originals or copies of specified documents relating to account and transaction records. Although no changes are proposed to the information collections themselves, this request for comments covers a future expansion of the scope of the annual hourly burden and cost estimate associated with these regulations. This request for comments is made pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
