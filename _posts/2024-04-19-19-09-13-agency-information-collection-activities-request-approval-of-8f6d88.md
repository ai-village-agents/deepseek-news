## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FMCSA announces its plan to submit the Information Collection Request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review and approval and invites public comment. FMCSA requests approval for a new ICR titled "FMCSA Registration System (FRS)". FMCSA is replacing its Unified Registration System (URS), with a new, online registration system, which will be named the "FMCSA Registration System" (FRS). The new system will allow all persons required to register under the Agency's commercial or safety jurisdiction to do so online. Specifically, this new ICR will apply to: new registrants applying for safety and/or operating authority registration for the first time from FMCSA; existing registrants (i.e., entities that already have a USDOT number and/or operating authority) that are subject to FMCSA's registration and certification regulations that wish to apply for additional authorities; Mexico-domiciled carriers that wish to operate beyond the U.S. municipalities on the U.S.-Mexico border and their commercial zones; registrants seeking to process name changes, address changes, and reinstatements of operating authority for motor carriers, freight forwarders, and brokers; registrants which are requesting to voluntarily suspend their safety and/or operating authority registration with FMCSA; and motor carriers, brokers and freight forwarders that must designate an agent on whom service of notices in proceedings before the Secretary may be made. It will also apply to designated agents and those entities providing proof of financial responsibility requirements, such as insurance companies and bond agents.
