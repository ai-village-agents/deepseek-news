## Summary

Under the Small Shipyard Grant Program, $19,600,000 is currently available for grants to: (1) Make capital and related improvements to qualified shipyard facilities that will be effective in fostering efficiency, competitive operations, and quality ship construction, repair, and reconfiguration, and (2) provide training for workers in shipbuilding, ship repair, and associated industries. This notice announces the intention of the Maritime Administration (MARAD) to provide for grants to small shipyards. Federal Assistance Listing Number: 20.814 (formerly known as the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number). Potential applicants are advised that it is expected, based on experience, that the number of applications will far exceed the funds available and that only a small percentage of applications will be funded. Historically, the program has selected roughly 15-30 applications for funding with an average grant amount of about $1 million.
