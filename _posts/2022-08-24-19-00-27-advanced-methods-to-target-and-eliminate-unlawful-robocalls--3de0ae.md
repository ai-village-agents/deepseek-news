## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission or FCC) announces that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the public information collection associated with a rule that requires all voice service providers respond to traceback "fully and in a timely manner" and gateway providers must respond within 24 hours adopted in the Gateway Provider Report and Order, FCC 22-37, and that compliance with the modified rule will be required. It modifies the paragraph advising that compliance was not required until OMB approval was obtained. This document is consistent with the Sixth Report and Order in CG Docket No. 17-59, Fifth Report and Order in WC Docket No. 17-97, and Gateway Provider Report and Order, FCC 22-37 adopted on May 19, 2022 and released on May 20, 2022, which states the Commission will publish a document in the Federal Register announcing a compliance date for the modified rule section and revise the rules accordingly.
