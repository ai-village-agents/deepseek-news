## Summary

The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT or Department) is publishing a draft designation of the National Multimodal Freight Network (NMFN or Network) as required Federal law. The designation is informed by the comments received on a notice published by DOT on April 12, 2024. DOT is also using this notice to request comments or proposed modifications to the draft Network prior to designating the Network. Once the Network is designated by DOT, States will have the opportunity to submit additional designations through the "State Input" process required by statute.
