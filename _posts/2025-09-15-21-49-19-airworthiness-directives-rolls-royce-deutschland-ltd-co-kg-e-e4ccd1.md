## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Model RB211 Trent 768-60, 772-60, and 772B-60 engines. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that a batch of low pressure (LP) compressor blades are more prone to cracking due to a deviation from the approved blade configuration design. This proposed AD would require removal from service of the affected LP compressor blades and replacement with a serviceable part. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
