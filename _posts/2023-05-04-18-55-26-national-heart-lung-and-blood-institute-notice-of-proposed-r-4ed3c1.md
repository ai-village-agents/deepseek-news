## Summary

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) will host a public hearing to enable discussion of the Institute's proposal to reorganize the Division of Lung Disease (DLD). The proposed reorganization aims to ensure effective oversight, alignment of expertise, and translation of knowledge within and across research areas in the lung disease field. It establishes a new branch structure that will strategically position leadership over DLD programs, balance workload, and enhance depth/ succession planning for ingrained operational sustainability. There will be no impact on the National Center on Sleep Disorders Research as a result of the restructuring. The online forums will allow members of the public to review the reorganization proposals and submit comments.
