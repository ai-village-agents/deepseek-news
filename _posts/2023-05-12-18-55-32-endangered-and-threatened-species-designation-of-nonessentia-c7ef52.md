## Summary

We, NMFS, propose a rule to designate and authorize the release of nonessential experimental populations (NEPs or experimental populations) of Sacramento River (SR) winter-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and Central Valley (CV) spring-run Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) in the McCloud and Upper Sacramento Rivers upstream of Shasta Dam (the NEP Area), California, and, under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), establish a limited set of take exceptions for the experimental populations. Successful reintroduction of populations within the species' historical ranges would contribute to viability and further conservation of these species. The issuance of limited protective regulations for the conservation of these species would provide regulatory assurances to the people in the Upper Sacramento River and McCloud River watersheds. This proposed rule also announces the availability for comment of a draft environmental assessment (EA) analyzing the environmental impacts of this proposed experimental population designation and the associated take exceptions.
