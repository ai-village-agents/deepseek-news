## Summary

The U.S. Copyright Office is proposing to amend its regulation governing the group registration option for newsletter issues. The proposed rule eliminates the requirement that newsletters must be published at least two days each week to qualify for a group registration. This will let a broader range of newsletter publishers register a month of issues, without imposing an administrative burden on the Office. In addition, the proposed rule updates the address where complimentary subscriptions should be sent for purposes of satisfying the mandatory deposit requirement for newsletters and other serials.
