## Summary

The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has notified EPA that is has adopted amendments to its Commercial Harbor Craft (CHC) regulation. By letter dated January 31, 2023, CARB asked that EPA authorize these amendments pursuant to section 209(e) of the Clean Air Act (CAA). On March 17, 2023, EPA announced an opportunity for public hearing and request for public comment on this request. In that Notice, EPA announced that it would only hold a virtual public hearing if a request for hearing was submitted and that the written comment period would close on May 1, 2023. EPA also announced that it would extend the written comment closure date in the event a virtual public hearing was requested and held. EPA has received multiple requests for a virtual public hearing, so therefore EPA is announcing the date of the virtual public hearing and the new comment deadline for CARB's request.\1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
