# Airworthiness Directives; Bombardier, Inc., Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-1A10 and BD-700-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports that the nose wheel steering selector valve (SSV) can be slow to deactivate under low temperature conditions. This proposed AD would require replacing the affected SSV with a re-designed SSV that has an improved response time. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
