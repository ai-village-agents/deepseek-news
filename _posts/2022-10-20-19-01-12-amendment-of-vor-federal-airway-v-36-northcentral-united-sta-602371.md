## Summary

This action amends VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airway V-36 by establishing an airway segment within United States (U.S.) airspace over Lake Superior. The new V-36 airway segment replaces a similar segment that was inadvertently removed in a previous rulemaking action supporting NAV CANADA's Navigational Aid (NAVAID) Modernization Program. This action also supports cross border airway connectivity with NAV CANADA's V-36 airway between the Thunder Bay, ON, Canada, VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) and the Wawa, ON, Canada, VOR/DME NAVAIDs.
