## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is soliciting public comments and suggestions about the petition process for exemptions regarding pesticides from registration and other requirements under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), where the pesticides are determined to be of a character unnecessary to be subject to regulation under FIFRA. The Agency is considering streamlining the petition process and revisions to how the Agency evaluates the potential minimum risk active and inert substances, factors used in classes of exemptions, state implementation of the minimum risk program and the need for any future exemptions or modifications to current exemptions. EPA is also requesting comment on whether the Agency should consider amending existing exemptions or adding new classes of pesticidal substances for exemption, such as peat when used in septic filtration systems.
