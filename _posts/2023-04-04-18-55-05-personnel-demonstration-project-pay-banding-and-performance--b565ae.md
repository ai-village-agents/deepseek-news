## Summary

The Civil Service Reform Act, authorizes the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to conduct demonstration projects that experiment with new and different human resources management concepts to determine whether changes in policies or procedures would result in improved Federal human resources management. On December 21, 2007, OPM published a document in the Federal Register announcing final approval of a demonstration project plan for the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a separately organized agency within the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). This notice constitutes OPM's approval of a modification of NNSA's final project plan to change performance rating levels and a related change to the performance rating level pay shares.
