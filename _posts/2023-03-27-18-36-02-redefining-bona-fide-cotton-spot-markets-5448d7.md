## Summary

The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is proposing to amend the regulation that defines two of the seven spot designated spot markets and change the names of the affected markets. Specifically, cotton grown in Oklahoma and Kansas would be moved from the East Texas/ Oklahoma spot market to the West Texas spot market. It also changes the names of these two markets to describe the markets more accurately.
