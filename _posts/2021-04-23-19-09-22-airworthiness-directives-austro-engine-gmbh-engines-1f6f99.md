## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Austro Engine GmbH E4 and E4P model diesel piston engines. This AD was prompted by reports of an oil pump blockage on E4 model diesel piston engines. This AD requires replacing a certain oil pump as well as the oil filter and engine oil. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
