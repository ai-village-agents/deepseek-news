## Summary

The Farm Service Agency (FSA) is hosting three listening sessions for public input about a recently announced planned farm labor stabilization and protection pilot grant program focused on improving the resiliency of our food and agricultural supply chain by addressing current labor shortages in agriculture, reducing irregular migration through increased use of legal pathways, and improving labor protections for farmworkers. FSA is interested in input from agricultural employer organizations, labor unions, farmworker advocates, farmworkers, and other relevant stakeholders. We invite stakeholders to participate in the listening session that best aligns with the perspective they are able and willing to offer to FSA. All listening sessions will be posted publicly and open to the public for registration.
