## Summary

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District (USACE) intends to prepare a Draft Supplemental Joint Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report (EIS/EIR) for the 2007 Folsom Dam Safety and Flood Damage Reduction EIS/EIR (2007 EIS/EIR) and the 2017 Folsom Dam Raise Project Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report (2017 SEIS/EIR). USACE will serve as lead National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) agency and the Central Valley Flood Protection Board (CVFPB) will serve as lead agency for compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The Folsom Dam Safety and Flood Damage Reduction Project (hereafter referred to as the Project) was originally authorized in the 2004 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act (EWDAA) and was later reauthorized in the 2007 Water Resources Development Act (WRDA). The Project is authorized for four components: (1) Emergency spillway gate modifications. (2) Raising the right and left wings of the main dam, Mormon Island Auxiliary Dam (MIAD), and the reservoir Dikes 1 through 8 by 3.5 feet. (3) Temperature control shutter automation and reconfiguration. (4) Downstream ecosystem restoration of Bushy Lake and Woodlake. This Draft Supplemental Joint EIS/EIR will address components of the authorized Project not previously addressed in the 2017 Folsom Dam Raise Project Final SEIS/EIR. Specifically, these components include construction of a new Dike 3, use of onsite borrow and multiple disposal locations including MIAD West and South and potential off-site locations, use of a rock crushing plant at MIAD East, use of on-site concrete batch plants for the Right Wing Dam and Left Wing Dam, and a detailed comprehensive plan for mitigation and restoration upon completion of construction. The flood risk management components of the Project will enhance the utilization of the existing surcharge flood storage space (temporary water storage space utilized during low- frequency flood events), and will increase the surcharge flood storage capacity of the reservoir.
