## Summary

NMFS adjusts the 2025 baseline quotas for U.S. North Atlantic albacore tuna (northern albacore) and North and South Atlantic swordfish quotas based on 2024 underharvest and applicable international quota transfers. NMFS also adjusts the 2025 Atlantic bluefin tuna category subquotas based on 2024 overharvest. These temporary adjustments apply throughout the 2025 fishing year and are effective through December 31, 2025 (for portions of the 2025 fishing year that are already completed, they are considered to apply retrospectively). These actions are necessary to implement the 2025 quotas consistent with the recommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) as required by the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (ATCA), and to achieve domestic management objectives under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act). Full annual baseline allocations will be available to U.S. harvesters starting January 1, 2026. Note that NMFS intends to take separate action as soon as possible in 2026 to modify the baseline Atlantic bluefin tuna quota consistent with the quota agreed to at the 2025 ICCAT annual meeting.
