## Summary

DoD is issuing a final rule amending the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to allow for the efficient and accurate identification of contracts subject to excise tax withholding. DoD is also amending the DFARS to prohibit use of the Governmentwide commercial purchase card as a method of payment when the tax on certain foreign procurements applies. These changes will promote the efficient administration of the excise tax.
