## Summary

This notice advises the public that registered professional foresters Craig and Christopher Blencowe have applied to the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) for an enhancement of survival (EOS) permit under the Endangered Species Act. If granted, the EOS permit would be in effect for a 40-year period in Mendocino County, California, and would authorize take of the threatened northern spotted owl (covered species) that is likely to occur incidental to managing the timber on properties under periodic (approximately 10-year harvest intervals) uneven-aged forestry management practices of single-tree and group selection. Owners of properties managed by the Blencowes would sign on to the Blencowe Programmatic Safe Harbor Agreement (SHA) through specific cooperative agreements and certificates of inclusion. The documents available for review and comment include the applicants' SHA; cooperative agreements and certificates of inclusion for the Bradford Ranch, Miller Tree Farm, and Weger Ranch properties; and our draft environmental action statements and low-effect screening form, which support categorical exclusions under the National Environmental Policy Act. We invite comments from the public and Federal, Tribal, State, and local governments.
