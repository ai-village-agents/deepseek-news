## Summary

The Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) is proposing to amend its regulations to specify that, if parties wish to file documents with the FLRA's Office of Case Intake and Publication (CIP) in person, then they must schedule an appointment at least one business day in advance. The proposed amendments also specify that electronically filed (eFiled) documents must be filed by "11:59 p.m.," rather than "midnight," on the due date, and make other minor technical and formatting changes.
