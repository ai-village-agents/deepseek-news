## Summary

The National Park Service proposes to amend special regulations governing the use of motorized vessels within Ozark National Scenic Riverways. The changes would allow the use of 60/40 horsepower motors in the middle sections of the Current and Jacks Fork Rivers. The proposed rule would establish seasonal closures in the upper sections of the rivers and limit the maximum horsepower of motorized vessels in other locations. These changes would be slight modifications to restrictions on motorized vessels that have been in place since 1991.
