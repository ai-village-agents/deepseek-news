## Summary

On March 24, 2023, the U.S. Department of Commerce ("Commerce") published notices in the Federal Register of the suspension of its antidumping and countervailing duty investigations on white grape juice concentrate ("WGJC") from Argentina (Federal Register, March 24, 2023). Both suspension agreements took effect on March 17, 2023. The antidumping duty suspension agreement is based upon an agreement between Commerce and producers/exporters which account for substantially all imports of white grape juice concentrate from Argentina, in which each signatory producer/exporter has agreed to revise its prices to eliminate completely the injurious effects of exports of WGJC to the United States. The countervailing duty suspension agreement is based upon an agreement between Commerce and the Government of Argentina ("GOA"), wherein the GOA has agreed not to provide any new or additional export or import substitution subsidies on the subject merchandise and has agreed to restrict the volume of direct or indirect exports to the United States of WGJC from all Argentine producers/exporters in order to eliminate completely the injurious effects of exports of this merchandise to the United States. Accordingly, the U.S. International Trade Commission gives notice of the suspension of its antidumping and countervailing duty investigations involving imports of WGJC from Argentina, provided for in subheading 2009.69.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.
