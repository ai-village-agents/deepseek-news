## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2016-26-05 and AD 2019-21-02, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A330-200, A330-200 Freighter, and A330-300 series airplanes. AD 2016-26-05 and AD 2019-21-02 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. This AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary, and that new airplanes have been added to the applicability. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2019-21-02, and also requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate additional new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
