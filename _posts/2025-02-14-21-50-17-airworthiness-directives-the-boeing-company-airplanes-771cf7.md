## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 747-400, 747-400F, 747-8F, and 747-8 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that, during potable water servicing, there were multiple engine indicating and crew alerting system messages. The cause was the separation of a fitting and steel water supply tube above an electronics equipment cooling air filter, behind the forward cargo compartment left sidewall. This AD requires, depending on configuration, installing at certain locations: conduits on exposed potable water supply lines, envelope assemblies over all exposed potable water line fittings and exposed potable water supply lines, a slitted spray shield, a two-piece deflector shield around the equipment cooling system (ECS) air inlet, and/or a shroud on exposed potable water supply lines. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
