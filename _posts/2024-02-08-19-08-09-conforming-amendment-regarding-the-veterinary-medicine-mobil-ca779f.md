## Summary

The Veterinary Medicine Mobility Act of 2014 (VMMA), which became law on August 1, 2014, amended the Controlled Substances Act to address separate registration requirements for veterinarians. The VMMA allows a veterinarian to transport and dispense controlled substances in the usual course of veterinary practice at a site other than the veterinarian's registered principal place of business or professional practice without obtaining a separate registration, subject to certain limitations. The Drug Enforcement Administration is amending its regulations to codify the VMMA. This rule merely conforms DEA regulations to statutory amendments of the Controlled Substances Act that have already taken effect and makes no substantive change to existing legal requirements.
