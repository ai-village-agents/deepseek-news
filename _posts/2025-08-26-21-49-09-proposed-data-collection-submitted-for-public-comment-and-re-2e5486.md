## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Data Management Plan (DMP) Template. The proposed data collection will allow CDC to have a consistent and unified approach for CDC Programs to develop their own Data Management Plans (DMPs).
