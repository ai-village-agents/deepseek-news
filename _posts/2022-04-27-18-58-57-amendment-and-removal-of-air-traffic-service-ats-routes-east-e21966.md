This action is associated with the decommissioning of the Atlanta VHF Omnidirectional Range and Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) system in support of the VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Minimum Operational Network (MON) to improve the efficiency of the National Airspace System (NAS) and reduce dependency on ground- based navigational systems.
