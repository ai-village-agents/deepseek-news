# Airworthiness Directives; Leonardo S.p.A. Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Leonardo S.p.A. Model AB139 and AW139 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of interference found in the overhead panel area between the electrical cables and adjacent connectors. This proposed AD would require repetitively inspecting the overhead panel and, depending on the results, repairing or replacing the damaged wires. This proposed AD would also require modifying the overhead panel on certain helicopters. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
