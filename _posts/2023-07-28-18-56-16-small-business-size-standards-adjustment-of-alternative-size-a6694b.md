## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA or Agency) proposes to amend its Small Business Size Regulations to increase the alternative size standard for its 7(a) Business and Certified Development Company (CDC/504) Loan Programs (collectively "Business Loan Programs") by 34.46% to account for inflation that has occurred since the size standard's establishment in 2010. The inflation adjustment would increase the size standard's level for tangible net worth to $20 million and for net income to $6.5 million. SBA also is adjusting for inflation the applicable statutory limits for contract size under the Surety Bond Guarantee (SBG) Program. The adjustment would increase the contract limit to $9 million and to $14 million for Federal contracts if a Federal contracting officer certifies that such a guarantee is necessary.
