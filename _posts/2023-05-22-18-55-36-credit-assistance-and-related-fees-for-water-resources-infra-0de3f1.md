## Summary

This final rule implements a new credit assistance program administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps). Consistent with the funding provided under Subtitle C of Title V of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA), often referred to as the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014 (WIFIA), credit assistance is available for safety projects to maintain, upgrade, and repair dams identified in the National Inventory of Dams with a primary owner type of state, local government, public utility, or private. This final rule establishes the process by which the Corps will administer such credit assistance, including the assessment of fees, and also sets forth the policies and procedures that the Corps will use for receiving, evaluating, approving applications, and servicing and monitoring direct loans and loan guarantees.
