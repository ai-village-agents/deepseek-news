## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-08-02, which applies to all Safran Helicopter Engines, S.A. (Safran) Arriel 2D and Arriel 2E model turboshaft engines. AD 2021-08- 02 requires replacing certain critical parts before reaching their published in-service life limits, performing scheduled maintenance tasks before reaching their published periodicity, and performing unscheduled maintenance tasks when the engine meets certain conditions. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-08-02, Safran has revised the airworthiness limitation section (ALS) of the existing maintenance and overhaul manuals, introducing new and more restrictive instructions and maintenance tasks. This proposed AD would require revisions to the ALS of the operator's existing approved aircraft maintenance program (AMP), as applicable, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
