## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER series airplanes, and certain Model 737-8 and -9 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of uncommanded escape slide deployments in the passenger compartment, caused by too much tension in the inflation cable and the movement of the escape slide assembly in the escape slide compartment. This AD requires inspecting all escape slide assemblies to identify affected parts, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
