## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for a new information collection. The collection involves data and report submissions by State, local and tribal participants in the UAS BEYOND program, and by industry participants in the Partnership for Safety Plan (PSP) program. UAS BEYOND and PSP participants will also conduct qualitative, non- statistical surveys of the general public. The information to be collected will be used to inform FAA policy and decision-making regarding integrating UAS into the National Airspace System.
