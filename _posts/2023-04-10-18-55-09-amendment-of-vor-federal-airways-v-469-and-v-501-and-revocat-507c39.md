## Summary

This action proposes to amend Very High Frequency (VHF) Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-469 and V-501, and revoke V-474. The FAA is proposing this action due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the St. Thomas, PA (THS), VOR/ Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) navigational aid (NAVAID). The St. Thomas VOR is being decommissioned in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
