## Summary

The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is seeking comments on whether to grant a general applicability public interest waiver of its Buy America requirements for the purchase of used locomotives that would serve as the underframe or chassis to convert them to all- electric, renewable diesel, battery-powered, or other renewable-energy locomotives. Such projects would remove highly polluting locomotives from the national rail network and replace them with more efficient locomotives that will reduce overall emissions, address environmental burdens on communities, and create domestic jobs. Purchases of these locomotives under FRA-funded projects are subject to FRA's Buy America requirements. However, given the age of these used locomotives, it is difficult and may not be possible to verify whether they are fully compliant with FRA's Buy America requirements. In this general applicability waiver, FRA does not propose to waive the applicable Build America, Buy America Act (BABA) requirements. This proposed waiver would not apply to any other manufactured products, steel, iron, or construction materials.
