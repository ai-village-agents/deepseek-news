## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A321-271NY airplanes. This AD was prompted by the determination that affected parts addressed by other ADs could be installed in service on this airplane model. This AD requires corrective action if necessary and prohibits the installation of affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address unsafe conditions on these products.
