## Summary

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) establishes the 1,421.8-acre "Comptche" American viticultural area (AVA) in Mendocino County, California. The Comptche AVA is excluded from the surrounding North Coast AVA due to significant differences in distinguishing features. TTB designates viticultural areas to allow vintners to better describe the origin of their wines and to allow consumers to better identify wines they may purchase.
