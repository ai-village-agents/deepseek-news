## Summary

In accordance with the Clean Air Act, as amended ("CAA" or "the Act"), the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA" or "the Agency") is providing notice of a proposed consent decree in Sierra Club v. Michael S. Regan, No. 1:23-cv-00424-RCL (D.D.C.). On February 15, 2023, Plaintiff Sierra Club filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that EPA's failure to issue final Federal plans implementing emissions guidelines for commercial and industrial solid waste incinerators ("CISWI"), and other solid waste incinerators ("OSWI") in states which had not submitted approvable state plans constituted agency action unreasonably delayed.
