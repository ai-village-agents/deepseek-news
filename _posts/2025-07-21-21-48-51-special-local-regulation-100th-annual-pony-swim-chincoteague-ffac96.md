## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary Special Local Regulation on the waters around Assateague, Chincoteague, and Wallops Islands, on Virginia's Eastern Shore. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters from potential hazards during the week of the 100th Annual Pony Roundup, Swim & Auction. All non-participants would be intermittently prohibited from entering, transiting through, anchoring in, or remaining within the regulated area without permission from the Captain of the Port or a designated representative.
