## Summary

The U.S. Department of Labor (Department or DOL) is issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that, if finalized, would require States to use State merit staff to provide Wagner-Peyser Act Employment Service (ES) services. If finalized, this proposal would extend the merit-staffing requirement to those States that previously had been operating different staffing models. The proposed changes would create a uniform standard of ES services provision for all States and align the use of State merit staff for ES services with the requirement that States administer the Unemployment Insurance (UI) programs with State merit staff. The Department is additionally proposing revisions to the ES regulations to strengthen the provision of services to migrant and seasonal farmworkers (MSFWs) and to enhance the protections afforded by the Monitor Advocate System and the Employment Service and Employment- Related Law Complaint System (Complaint System).
