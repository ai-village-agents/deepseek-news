## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace at Greenville, IL, and Vandalia, IL. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of airspace reviews conducted due to the decommissioning of the Vandalia very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimum Operating Network (MON) Program. The geographic coordinates of the airports would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database. This action will bring the airspace into compliance with FAA orders to support instrument flight rule (IFR) operations.
