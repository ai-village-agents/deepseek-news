## Summary

USAID's Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (USAID/BHA) proposes to survey all members of its workforce to assess and gauge its processes for developing and improving a more cohesive BHA culture. This survey is also sent to institutional support contractors (ISCs), which are part of the USAID workforce but are members of the public for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA). USAID/BHA invites the general public and other Federal agencies to take this opportunity to comment on the following new information collection as it relates to ISCs, as required by the PRA. The purpose of this notice is to allow 60 days for public comment preceding submission of the collection to OMB.
