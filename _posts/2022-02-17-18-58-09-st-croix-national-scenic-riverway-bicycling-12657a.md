## Summary

The National Park Service amends the special regulations for St. Croix National Scenic Riverway to allow bicycle use on a 0.25-mile connector trail across National Park Service land near Cable, Wisconsin. The new trail will provide direct access to the Riverway and new recreational opportunities within the Riverway and on the Chequamegon Area Mountain Bike Association trail network in Bayfield County, Wisconsin. National Park Service regulations require promulgation of a special regulation to designate new trails for bicycle use off park roads and outside of developed areas.
