## Summary

Pursuant to its statutory authority to conduct intellectual property programs, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO or Office) is launching a pilot program to promote and incentivize brand owners who offer products and services that help address humanitarian issues utilizing a federally registered trademark. The pilot program will be conducted as an awards competition. For the inaugural program, the humanitarian theme will be the environment. Participating trademark owners will submit program applications describing how the provision of their goods or services, in connection with a trademark registered by the USPTO, has addressed a humanitarian environmental problem impacting people or the planet.
