## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of New Hampshire on March 11, 2019. This revision establishes sulfur content limitations for fuels. In addition, the State requested withdrawal from the SIP of the existing sulfur limitations regulation, which will be superseded by the State's revised sulfur limitations regulation. The intended effect of this action is to approve the State's March 11, 2019 submittal into the New Hampshire SIP and remove from the SIP the superseded sulfur in fuels limitations. This action is being taken under the Clean Air Act.
