## Summary

This order partially revokes 8 Public Land Orders (PLOs) insofar as they affect approximately 812,956.96 acres of public lands reserved for study and classification, as appropriate, by the Department of the Interior. This order opens these lands specifically to allow for allotment selection by eligible Alaska Native Vietnam-era Veterans and possible conveyance under the Alaska Native Vietnam-era Veterans Land Allotment Program (Allotment Program) established by the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act of 2019 (Dingell Act). The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) analyzed partial revocation of these PLOs and opening of the affected lands for allotment selections and possible conveyances in the Alaska Native Vietnam-era Veterans Land Allotment Program Environmental Assessment (Allotment Program EA) and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) signed on April 21, 2022.
