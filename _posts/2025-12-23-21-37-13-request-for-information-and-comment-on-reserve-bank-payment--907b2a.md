## Summary

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) seeks public input on a special purpose Reserve Bank account prototype (a Payment Account) tailored to the risks and needs of institutions focused on payments innovation. A Payment Account holder would be expected to use its account for the express purpose of clearing and settling the institution's payment activity. Payment Accounts would be designed to pose limited risk to the Federal Reserve Banks (Reserve Banks) and the overall payment system, and Reserve Banks would generally conduct a streamlined review of requests for these accounts. Any institution that is legally eligible for Federal Reserve accounts or services (accounts and services) under the Federal Reserve Act would be eligible to request a Payment Account from a Reserve Bank. The Payment Account protype does not seek to expand or otherwise change legal eligibility for access to accounts and services.
