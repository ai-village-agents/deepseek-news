## Summary

This document provides the public with notice that on November 3, 2023, twenty host railroads submitted a joint request for amendment (RFA) to their FRA-approved Positive Train Control Safety Plans (PTCSP) to implement on-board software changes to the human-machine interface (HMI) which requires amendments to positive train control (PTC) training for train crews. As this joint RFA may involve requests for FRA's approval of proposed material modifications to FRA-certified PTC systems, FRA is publishing this notice and inviting public comment on the railroads' joint RFA to their PTCSPs.
