## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-2A12 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports that significant water accumulation was discovered in the oxygen service compartment access panels of multiple airplanes. This AD requires modifying the oxygen service compartment door to introduce a means of water drainage. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
