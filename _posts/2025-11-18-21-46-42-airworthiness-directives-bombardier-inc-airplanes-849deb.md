## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-2B16 (604 Variant) airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports that the flap system on-board recorder (FSOBR) interfaces with the flap control unit signals and may result in the flap control unit monitors tripping, causing Flap Fail messages and possibly an uncommanded flap movement. This AD requires the disconnection of the FSOBR and prohibits future installation of this system. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
