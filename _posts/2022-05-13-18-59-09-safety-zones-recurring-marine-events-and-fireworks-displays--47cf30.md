## Summary

The Coast Guard is amending its safety zones established for recurring marine events and fireworks displays that take place within the Fifth Coast Guard District area of responsibility. This action is necessary to address minor revisions to the listing of events that informs the public of regularly scheduled fireworks displays that require additional safety measures provided by regulations. Through this final rule, the current list of recurring marine events requiring safety zones will be updated with two additional events that take place in the Sector Virginia area of responsibility. This regulation prohibits persons and vessels from being in the safety zones unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Virginia or a designated representative.
