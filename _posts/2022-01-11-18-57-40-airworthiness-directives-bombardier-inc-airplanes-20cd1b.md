## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-100-1A10 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a discovery that a lockwire may not have been installed on the side stay actuator pin nut of the main landing gear (MLG). This AD requires inspecting the left-hand and right-hand MLG side stay actuator assembly pin nut for the presence of a lockwire, and installing a lockwire if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
