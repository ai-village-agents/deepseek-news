## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Piper Aircraft, Inc., (Piper) Model PA-46-600TP airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by testing that showed that the wing splice assembly could fail before the assembly reaches its established life limit. This proposed AD would require revising the Airworthiness Limitations section of the existing maintenance manual (MM) or instructions for continued airworthiness to reduce the life limit of the wing splice assembly. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
