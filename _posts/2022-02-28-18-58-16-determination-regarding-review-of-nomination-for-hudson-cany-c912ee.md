## Summary

In January 2022, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) requested written comments to facilitate the five-year review of the nomination for Hudson Canyon National Marine Sanctuary (NMS). NOAA requested relevant and new information pertaining to its 11 sanctuary nomination evaluation criteria. In particular, NOAA sought any additional details about the area's natural or cultural resources, emerging threats to these resources, and evolving management efforts or human uses in the proposed area (e.g., wind energy proposals). After reviewing the information gathered through the public process and completing an internal analysis of readily-available and relevant information on the proposed area, NOAA has determined the Hudson Canyon NMS nomination will remain on the inventory until at least February 23, 2027.
