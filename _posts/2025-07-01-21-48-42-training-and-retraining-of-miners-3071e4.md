## Summary

MSHA proposes to revise its regulations to eliminate provisions that allow District Managers to require changes in, or additions to, training programs. The current regulations appear to violate statutory authority; the Appointments Clause, by vesting significant regulatory authority in District Managers; and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), by skipping notice and comment related to undesignated and unpredictable requirements.
