## Summary

This final rule amends HUD's regulations to implement changes to the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) tenant-based program and the Project-Based Voucher (PBV) program made by the Housing Opportunity Through Modernization Act of 2016 (HOTMA). HOTMA made several amendments to the HCV and PBV programs, including establishing a statutory definition of public housing agency (PHA)-owned housing, and amending several elements of both programs. In response to public comments, HUD has also included additional regulatory changes in this final rule that are intended to reduce the burden on public housing agencies, by either modifying requirements or simplifying and clarifying existing regulatory language.
