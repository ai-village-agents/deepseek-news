## Summary

This action establishes United States Area Navigation (RNAV) Routes T-340, T-342, T-344, and T-346 in the Hawaiian Islands. These RNAV routes facilitate the movement of aircraft among the Hawaiian Islands and increase operational efficiencies to RNAV Standard Instrument Departures (SID) and RNAV Standard Terminal Arrival Routes (STAR), which enhances the air traffic capacity of the Hawaiian airports.
