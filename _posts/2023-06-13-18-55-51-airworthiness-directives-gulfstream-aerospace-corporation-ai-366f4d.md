## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation Model GVII-G500 and GVII-G600 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of two landing incidents in which the alpha limiter engaged in the landing flare in unstable air, resulting in high rate of descent landings and damage to the airplanes. This AD requires updating the flight control computer (FCC) software. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
