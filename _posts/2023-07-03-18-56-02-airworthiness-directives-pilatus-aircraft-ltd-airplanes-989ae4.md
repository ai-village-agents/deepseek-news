## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Pilatus Aircraft Ltd. (Pilatus) Model PC-24 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that an incorrect wiring arrangement was detected around the weather radar system. This AD requires modifying the weather radar redundant wiring, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference (IBR). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
