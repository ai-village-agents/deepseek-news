## Summary

NMFS has evaluated plans for three hatchery programs rearing and releasing Chinook, coho, and pink salmon in the Dungeness River basin, submitted by the Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe and Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) as co-managers pursuant to the limitation on take prohibitions for actions conducted under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The plans describe hatchery programs operated by the co-managers. This document serves to notify the public of the availability of an Evaluation and Recommended Determination Document (ERD) in which NMFS, by delegated authority from the Secretary of Commerce, has determined that implementing and enforcing these hatchery and genetics management plans (HGMPs) will not appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery nor modify or destroy critical habitat of Puget Sound Chinook salmon or Puget Sound steelhead.
