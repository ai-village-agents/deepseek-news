# FCC Empowers Short-Range Radars in the 60 GHz Band

## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) revises its rules to provide new opportunities for unlicensed field disturbance sensor (FDS) devices (e.g., radars) to operate in the 57-71 GHz band (60 GHz band) while still ensuring coexistence with other unlicensed technologies in the band. The Commission's decision is a significant step in the continuing expansion and evolution of its rules and will supercharge the development and deployment of new and innovative radar operations--including valuable safety applications that detect unattended children in vehicles and which previously could only be permitted through a waiver of the rules.
