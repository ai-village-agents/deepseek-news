## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing a direct final rule to revise a requirement for contracting officers. The requirement updates special contracting methods, transferring the approval authority for certain contracting actions from the Service Center Manager (SCM) to the Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA). This change reflects an internal reorganization of EPA's contracting functions and aims to enhance efficiency and streamline decision-making within the Agency. Because this amendment only affects EPA contracting officers, we expect no adverse impact on the public and are proceeding with a direct final rule.
