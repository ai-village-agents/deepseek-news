## Summary

The Board is inviting public comment on the models used to conduct the Board's supervisory stress test, changes to those models to be implemented in the 2026 stress test, and proposed changes to enhance the transparency and public accountability of the Board's stress testing framework (the proposal). The proposal would amend the Policy Statement on the Scenario Design Framework for Stress Testing, including to implement guides for additional scenario variables, and the Stress Testing Policy Statement. The proposal would also codify an enhanced disclosure process under which the Board would annually publish comprehensive documentation on the stress test models, invite public comment on any material changes that the Board seeks to make to those models, and annually publish the stress test scenarios for comment. Lastly, the proposal would make changes to the FR Y-14A/Q/M to remove items that are no longer needed to conduct the supervisory stress test and to collect additional data to support the stress test models and improve risk capture.
