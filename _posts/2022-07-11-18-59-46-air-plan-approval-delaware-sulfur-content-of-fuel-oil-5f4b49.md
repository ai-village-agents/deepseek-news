## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Delaware. The revision pertains to the reduction of the maximum allowable sulfur content limit for distillate fuels, from a current limit of 3000 parts per million (ppm) (0.3% by weight) to 15 ppm (0.0015% by weight) and residential fuels from a current limit of 1.0% by weight to 0.5% by weight. This revision also adds requirements for sampling and testing along with certification and recordkeeping. Additionally, start up, shut down and malfunction provisions that were previously included in the Delaware SIP have been removed in this revision. EPA has determined that such removal corrects a deficiency identified in the June 12, 2015, SIP call issued to Delaware. EPA is approving the revision to the Delaware SIP in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
