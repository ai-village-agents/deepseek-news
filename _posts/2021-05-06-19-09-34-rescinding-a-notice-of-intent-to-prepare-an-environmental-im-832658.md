## Summary

The FHWA, in cooperation with the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) and the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT), is issuing this Notice to advise the public that we are rescinding the 1999 Notice of Intent (NOI) to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for a previous proposal to rehabilitate, reconstruct, or replace the Shore Road Bridge (a.k.a. Pelham Park bridge) over the Hutchinson River Project (the Project), in Bronx County, New York [New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) Project Identification Number (PIN) X760.75]. We are rescinding the NOI because a substantial amount of time has passed since its publication and previously identified funding had been realocated to more urgent projects after September 11, 2001.
