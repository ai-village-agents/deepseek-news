## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is taking direct final action to revise the Agency's Privacy Act regulations to exempt a modified system of records, EPA-83, the Personnel Security System (PSS) 2.0, from certain requirements of the Privacy Act because of the data sensitivity contained within an insider threat inquiry. A lack of protection of these data could jeopardize the insider threat inquiry or additional investigations if warranted.
