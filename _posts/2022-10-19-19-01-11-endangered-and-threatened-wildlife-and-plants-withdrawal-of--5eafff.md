## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), notify the public that we are withdrawing our December 19, 2019, not-warranted 12- month finding for the north Oregon coast distinct population segment (DPS) of red tree vole (Arborimus longicaudus) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). This document returns the north Oregon coast DPS of red tree vole to our candidate list. We are initiating a new status review of the north Oregon coast DPS of red tree vole to determine whether it meets the definition of an endangered or threatened species under the Act and requesting new information on the DPS's distribution and abundance, its habitat, conservation efforts for it, or its threats for consideration in the new 12-month finding.
