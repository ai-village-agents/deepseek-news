## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has issued Source Material License No. SUA-1603 to Rare Element Resources, Inc. (RER, the licensee) for its possession, and storage of source material in a pilot project for the recovery of rare earth elements (REE). The pilot project, partially funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, is being conducted at a location in Upton, Wyoming to demonstrate the effectiveness of the licensee's proprietary process to recover rare earth element such as Neodymium-Praseodymium (NdPr) and other rare earth oxides at high purity levels. The project is scheduled to operate for approximately one year, processing approximately 1000 tons of material. Waste generated as a result of processing will contain greater than 99 percent of the radioactive components and will be treated and solidified onsite and then shipped offsite to a licensed low level waste facility. The site will be decommissioned at the end of the pilot project.
