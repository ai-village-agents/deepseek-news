# Airworthiness Directives; Safran Helicopter Engines, S.A. (Type Certificate Previously Held by Turbomeca, S.A.) Engines

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Safran Helicopter Engines, S.A. (Safran) Model ARRIUS 2F and ARRIUS 2R engines. This proposed AD was prompted by a manufacturer investigation that revealed certain high-pressure (HP) turbine blades may contain non-compliant porosity rates due to a change in the manufacturing process. This proposed AD would require replacement of affected HP turbine blades, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
