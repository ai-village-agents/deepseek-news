## Summary

This final rule updates the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) numbers for paper and paper-based packaging products in the Paper and Paper-Based Packaging Promotion, Research, and Information Order (Order). In addition, this action adds new language that allows assessment collection to continue even if HTS numbers change in the future. The Paper and Packaging Board (Board) administers the Order with oversight by the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS).
