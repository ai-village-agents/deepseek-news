## Summary

NMFS implements an accountability measure (AM) for the lane snapper commercial and recreational sectors in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) for the 2022 fishing year through this temporary rule. NMFS has projected that the 2022 stock annual catch limit (ACL) for Gulf lane snapper has been reached. Therefore, NMFS closes the commercial and recreational sectors for Gulf lane snapper on November 15, 2022, and they will remain closed through the end of the current fishing year on December 31, 2022. These closures are necessary to protect the Gulf lane snapper resource.
