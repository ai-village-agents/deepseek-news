## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC, Commission, or Agency) proposes to modify an existing system of records, FCC/OMD-24, Physical Access Control System (PACS), subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. This action is necessary to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act to publish in the Federal Register notice of the existence and character of records maintained by the agency. The Commission uses this system to maintain records on those individuals to whom the FCC has issued credentials. This modification makes various necessary changes and updates, including formatting changes required by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-108 since its previous publication, the addition of three new routine uses, and the revision of five existing routine uses.
