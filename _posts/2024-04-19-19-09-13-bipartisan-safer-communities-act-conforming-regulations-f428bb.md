## Summary

The Department of Justice ("Department") is amending Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives ("ATF") regulations to implement firearms-related definitions and requirements established by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act ("BSCA") and the NICS Denial Notification Act ("NDNA"). These statutes went into effect on June 25, 2022, and October 1, 2022, respectively. It is necessary to make conforming changes to ensure that ATF's regulations are current and consistent with the applicable statutes. For this reason, this direct final rule incorporates many of the BSCA and NDNA provisions that are applicable to ATF.
