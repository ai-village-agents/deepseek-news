## Summary

On January 6, 2021, HUD published a notice in the Federal Register entitled, "Allocations, Common Application, Waivers, and Alternative Requirements for Disaster Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery Grantees; Second Allocation." The notice incorrectly stated that under a separate Federal Register notice, HUD will allocate $185,730,000 for mitigation activities. The correct amount is $186,781,000. Today's notice corrects the notice published on January 6, 2021.
