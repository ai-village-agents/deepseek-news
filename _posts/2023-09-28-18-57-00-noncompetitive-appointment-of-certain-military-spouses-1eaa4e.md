## Summary

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing interim regulations to implement the changes authorized by the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 on the noncompetitive appointment authority for certain military spouses. These changes extend certain temporary provisions and remove the reporting requirements that were imposed by the NDAA for FY 2019. These changes will continue to enhance the recruitment and hiring of military spouses for permanent Federal positions in the competitive service.
