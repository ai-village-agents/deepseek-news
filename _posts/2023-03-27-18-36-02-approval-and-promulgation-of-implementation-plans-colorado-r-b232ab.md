## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving the majority of revisions to Regulation Number 3 of the Code of Colorado Regulations (CCR) submitted to the EPA by the State of Colorado on March 22, 2021. The revisions that the EPA is finalizing approval on include updated references to other sections of the CCR that were moved to a new location, as well as changes to Regulation 3 to reflect digitalization of public notice and comment procedures. The EPA is not finalizing approval of revisions that reflect changes made by Colorado to update dates of incorporation by reference (IBR) of sections of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) for the reasons outlined in section I of the preamble of this final rule. The EPA is taking this action pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA).
