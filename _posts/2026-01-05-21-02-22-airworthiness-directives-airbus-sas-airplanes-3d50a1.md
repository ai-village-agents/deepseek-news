## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A330-200, A330-200 Freighter, A330-300, A330-800, A330-900, A340-200, A340-300, A340-500, and A340-600 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by reported occurrences of forward passenger/crew doors jamming during slide deployment. This AD requires repetitive detailed inspections and, depending on findings, corrective action(s). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
