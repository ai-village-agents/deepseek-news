# Airworthiness Directives; Leonardo S.p.a. Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Leonardo S.p.a. (Leonardo) Model AW189 helicopters. This AD requires various repetitive inspections of the main rotor (MR) damper. This AD was prompted by reports of in-service MR damper failures and the development of an improved MR damper. This condition, if not corrected, could lead to loss of the lead-lag damping function of the MR blade, possibly resulting in damage to adjacent critical rotor components and subsequent loss control of the helicopter. The actions of this AD are intended to address the unsafe condition on these products.
