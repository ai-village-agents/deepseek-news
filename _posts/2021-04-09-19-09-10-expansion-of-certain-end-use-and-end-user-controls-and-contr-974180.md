## Summary

On January 15, 2021, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) published an interim final rule establishing end-use and end-user controls, as well as controls on specific activities of U.S. persons, with respect to certain military-intelligence end uses and end users. These new controls were made effective on March 16, 2021. In this interim final rule, BIS is making technical corrections and conforming changes to certain provisions of the Export Administration Regulations to address inadvertent errors introduced by the January 15, 2021 rule. This interim final rule also adds Burma to the list of countries subject to military-intelligence-related controls that were added by the prior rule. This action strengthens sanctions on Burma that were imposed on March 8, 2021 in response to a February 1, 2021 military coup.
