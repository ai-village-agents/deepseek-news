## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Transportation (DOT) proposes to establish a new system of records (hereafter referred to as "Notice") titled, "Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration DOT/FAA 857 Accidents, Incidents and Investigations." This system of records supports the FAA's mission of aviation safety by investigating and sharing accident and incident information with stakeholders, including the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The information maintained in this system includes several kinds of records such as toxicology reports, autopsy reports, incident and accident reports (including small Unmanned Aircraft System (small UAS) accident reports), maintenance records, responses to regulatory and statutory non-compliance determinations, data request logs, medical case reviews, and other records that support FAA accidents, incidents and investigations. Other information included are toxicology records regarding investigations of accidents or incidents for other modes of transportation and special requests from transportation entities from foreign governments.
