# Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-15- 01, which applied to certain The Boeing Company Model 777 airplanes. AD 2017-15-01 required replacing the existing mode control panel (MCP) with a new MCP having a different part number. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2017-15-01, expands the applicability to include certain other airplanes, and adds a new requirement for certain airplanes to identify and replace the affected parts. This AD was prompted by a determination that the affected parts may be installed on airplanes outside of the original applicability of AD 2017-15-01. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
