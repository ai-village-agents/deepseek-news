## Summary

The DoD requests comments on proposed changes to the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2019 ed.) (MCM). The proposed changes implement certain provisions of the National Defense Authorization Acts for Fiscal Years 2018, 2019, and 2020 and concern (1) the rules of procedure and evidence applicable in trials by courts- martial; and (2) the punitive articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The approval authority for these changes is the President. These proposed changes have not been coordinated within the DoD under DoD Directive 5500.01, "Preparing, Processing and Coordinating Legislation, Executive Orders, Proclamations, Views Letters, and Testimony," June 15, 2007, and do not constitute the official position of the DoD, the Military Departments, or any other Government agency.
