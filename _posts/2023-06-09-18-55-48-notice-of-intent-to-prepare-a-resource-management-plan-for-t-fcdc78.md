## Summary

In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (NEPA), the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, as amended (FLPMA), Presidential Proclamations entitled "Establishment of the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument" (June 9, 2000) and "Boundary Enlargement of the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument" (January 12, 2017), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Oregon/Washington (OR/WA) and California (CA) State Offices intend to revise a resource management plan (RMP) with an associated environmental impact statement (EIS) for the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument (Monument). With this notice, the BLM announces the beginning of a 60-day public scoping period to solicit public comments and identify issues, provide the planning criteria for public review, and issue a call for nominations for areas of critical environmental concern (ACECs). This RMP revision would replace the existing 2008 Monument RMP.
