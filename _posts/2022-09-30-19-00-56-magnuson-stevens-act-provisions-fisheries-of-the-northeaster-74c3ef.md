## Summary

This rulemaking proposes to add the Omega net mesh measurement gauge as a permissible device for net mesh measurement and correct regulatory references to gear restrictions. This action is required to allow the use of the Omega gauge as another method for measuring and enforcing net mesh size. Adoption of the Omega gauge, a handheld electronic device, is intended to improve the efficiency, safety, and cost-effectiveness of enforcement boardings at-sea.
