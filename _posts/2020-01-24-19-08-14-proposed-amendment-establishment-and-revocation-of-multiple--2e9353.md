## Summary

This action proposes to amend six VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways, V-2, V-77, V-138, V-218, V-246 and V-398; establish two low altitude Area Navigation (RNAV) routes, T-348 and T- 389; and remove one VOR Federal airway, V-411, in the vicinity of Waukon, IA. The Air Traffic Service (ATS) route modifications are necessary due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Waukon, IA, VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) navigation aid (NAVAID). The NAVAIDs provide navigation guidance for portions of the affected air traffic service (ATS) routes. The VOR is being decommissioned as part of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
