## Summary

Through this Request for Information (RFI), the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), seeks to further the development of employment programs for nonresident parents by soliciting information and recommendations from a broad array of stakeholders in the public and private sectors, including state, regional, tribal, and local areas. The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (Evidence Act) requires federal agencies to develop evidence-building plans to identify and address policy questions relevant to programs, policies, and regulations of the agency. In this vein, ACF will analyze information collected from this RFI to continue developing a learning and action agenda to better understand the effectiveness of employment programs for nonresident parents.
