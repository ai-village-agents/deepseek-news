## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Model RB211-Trent 800 engines. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of cracks on certain intermediate-pressure compressor (IPC) rotor shaft balance lands. This proposed AD would require initial and repetitive on-wing or in-shop borescope inspections (BSIs) of certain IPC rotor shaft balance lands for cracks, dents, and nicks, and replacement of the IPC rotor shaft if necessary, and would prohibit the installation of a certain IPC rotor shaft on any engine, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
