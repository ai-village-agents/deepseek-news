## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to temporarily change the operating schedule that governs the Wishkah Street Bridge across the Wishkah River at mile 0.4 in Aberdeen, WA. The bridge will remain in the closed to navigation position while the bridge owner, Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), performs maintenance and restoration work on the bridge. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
