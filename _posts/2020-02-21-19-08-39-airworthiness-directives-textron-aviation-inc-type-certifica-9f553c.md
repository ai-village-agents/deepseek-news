## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Textron Aviation Inc. (Textron) (type certificate previously held by Cessna Aircraft Company) Models 210G, T210G, 210H, T210H, 210J, T210J, 210K, T210K, 210L, T210L, 210M, and T210M airplanes. This AD requires visual and eddy current inspections of the carry-thru spar lower cap, corrective action if necessary, application of a protective coating and corrosion inhibiting compound (CIC), and reporting the inspection results to the FAA. This AD was prompted by the in-flight break-up of a Model T210M airplane in Australia, due to fatigue cracking that initiated at a corrosion pit, and subsequent reports of other Model 210-series airplanes with widespread and severe corrosion. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
