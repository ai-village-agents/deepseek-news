## Summary

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the McClung Museum of Natural History and Culture (MM) have completed an inventory of human remains and associated funerary objects in consultation with the appropriate Federally-recognized Indian Tribes, and have determined that there is no cultural affiliation between the human remains and associated funerary objects and any present-day Federally-recognized Indian Tribes. Representatives of any Federally-recognized Indian Tribe not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request to the TVA. If no additional requestors come forward, transfer of control of the human remains and associated funerary objects to the Federally-recognized Indian Tribe stated in this notice may proceed.
