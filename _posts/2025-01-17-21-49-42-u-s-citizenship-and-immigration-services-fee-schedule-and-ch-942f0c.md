## Summary

On January 31, 2024, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published a final rule to adjust certain immigration and naturalization benefit request fees charged by USCIS, add fee exemptions, and make changes to certain other immigration benefit request requirements. The rule took effect on April 1, 2024. In this notice, we are correcting a technical error made in that rule.
