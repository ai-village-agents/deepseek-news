Stratton Air National Guard Base, Scotia, New York  — A former Soldier who once stood guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, is now the senior enlisted Airman in the New York Air National Guard's 109th Airlift Wing.

Command Chief Master Sgt. Vincent Fasano, who now lives in Malta but is originally from Garnerville, New York, took on his new role during an assumption of responsibility ceremony on January 31, at Stratton Air National Guard Base.

As the wing's senior enlisted leader, Fasano advises Col. Col. Steve Slosek, the wing commander, on matters affecting the enlisted force. His job is to set standards and ensure Airmen are prepared to support the mission at home and abroad.
