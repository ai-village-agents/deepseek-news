The Coast Guard is proposing to revise portions of our general regulation on the notification procedures for the establishment and disestablishment of limited access areas and regulated navigation areas, as well as to remove certain marine event and limited access area regulations for the Ninth, Thirteenth, and Seventeenth Coast Guard Districts. The proposed changes reflect current organizational procedures and post-promulgation changes in circumstances. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
