## Summary

The United States Forest Service (USFS) has filed an application with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) requesting that the Secretary of the Interior withdraw 3,739 acres of National Forest System (NFS) lands located within the Prescott National Forest from location and entry under the U.S. mining laws, and from leasing under the mineral and geothermal leasing laws, for a 20-year term, subject to valid existing rights. The purpose of the withdrawal requested is to protect the Hassayampa River Riparian Corridor, located in Yavapai County, Arizona, from potential adverse impacts from mining, mineral, and geothermal leasing. Publication of this notice temporarily segregates the lands for up to two years, initiates a 90-day public comment period, and announces to the public an opportunity to request a public meeting on the withdrawal application.
