## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35), the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval the following information collection: OSC's Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Program Survey. The currently approved information collection (OMB Control Number 3255-0008) has been revised to streamline survey administration. OSC now uses a single survey distributed electronically to participants immediately following their ADR mediation session, replacing the previous two-part process. The survey is voluntary and anonymous, and responses are used to evaluate program effectiveness, improve service delivery, and identify areas for enhancement.
