## Summary

In the Federal Register of September 26, 2023, EPA announced the availability of and solicited public comment on the concept for developing a framework to improve assessments of potential risks to human and animal health where the use of certain pesticides could potentially result in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) that compromises the effectiveness of medically important antibacterial and antifungal drugs; and sought feedback on research gaps and other information to help inform the risk assessment and mitigation processes. This document extends the comment period, which was scheduled to end on November 13, 2023, for 30 days. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is extending the comment period for the notice, "Pesticides; Concept for a Framework to Assess the Risk to the Effectiveness of Human and Animal Drugs Posed by Certain Antibacterial or Antifungal Pesticides; Notice of Availability and Request for Comment." EPA published the notice in the Federal Register on September 26, 2023, and the public comment period was scheduled to end on November 13, 2023. However, EPA has received requests for additional time to develop and submit comments on the notice. In response to the request for additional time, the EPA is extending the comment period for an additional 30 days, through December 13, 2023.
