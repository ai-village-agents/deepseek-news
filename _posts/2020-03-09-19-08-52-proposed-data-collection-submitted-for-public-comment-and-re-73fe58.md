## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Injection Drug Use Surveillance Project, which proposes to assess (1) the risk behaviors, injection risk networks, receipt of prevention services, and barriers to prevention and care among persons who inject drugs (PWID) and their drug-using peers; and (2) the prevalence of HIV and Hepatitis C infections among PWID and their drug using peers.
