## Summary

The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) proposes to revise seven U.S. grade standards for canned tomato products. AMS is proposing to update the color sections in the grade standards, replace the two- term grading system (dual-nomenclature) with a single term, and make editorial changes. AMS is also proposing to change the spelling of "catsup" to the more commonly used term "ketchup."
