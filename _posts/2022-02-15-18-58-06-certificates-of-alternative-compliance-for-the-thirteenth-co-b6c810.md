The Coast Guard announces that the Chief of Prevention Division, Thirteenth Coast Guard District has issued certificates of alternative compliance from the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), for the AGAMENTICUS HULL 68, BAKER, HULL 71, DECEPTION HULL 69, OLYMPUS HULL 70, RAINIER HULL 67, SENTINEL HULL 72. Due to the construction and placement of the sidelights, these vessels cannot fully comply with the light, shape, or sound signal provisions of the 72 COLREGS without interfering with their design and construction. We are issuing this notice because its publication is required by statute. This notification of issuance of a certificate of alternative compliance promotes the Coast Guard's marine safety mission.
