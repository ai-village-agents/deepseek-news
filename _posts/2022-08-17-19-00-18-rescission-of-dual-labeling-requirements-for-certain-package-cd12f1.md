## Summary

The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is amending its labeling regulations to remove provisions that require packages of meat or poultry products that contain at least one pound or one pint, but less than four pounds or one gallon, to express the net weight or net contents in two different units of measurement on the product label. FSIS is taking this action in response to a petition submitted on behalf of a small meat processing establishment. After reviewing the regulatory provisions and the comments on the proposed rule to remove them, FSIS has determined that it is not necessary for labels of any meat or poultry products to bear dual statements of weight or content using more than one unit of measurement to convey the accurate weight or amount of the product to consumers.
