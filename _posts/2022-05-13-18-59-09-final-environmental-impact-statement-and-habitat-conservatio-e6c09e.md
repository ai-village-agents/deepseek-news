## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce the availability of a final environmental impact statement (FEIS), which analyzes a proposed habitat conservation plan (HCP) developed by Thurston County, Washington (applicant, or the County). This FEIS was prepared jointly by the Service and Thurston County to satisfy both the National Environmental Policy Act and the Washington State Environmental Policy Act. The HCP was submitted by the applicant in support of an application for an incidental take permit (ITP) under the Endangered Species Act. The applicant is seeking authorization for the incidental take of six species, which is expected to result from various County-permitted development activities, as well as construction and maintenance of County-owned or County-managed infrastructure, over the next 30 years.
