## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Learjet, Inc., Model 45 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would require revising the existing inspection program to incorporate reduced inspection intervals for the anti-ice manifold assembly. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
