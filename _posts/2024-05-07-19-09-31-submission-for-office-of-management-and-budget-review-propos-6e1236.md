## Summary

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) proposes to extend approval of the existing overarching generic clearance for Financial Reports used for ACF Non-discretionary Grant Programs (OMB #0970-0510) as well as all information collections currently approved under the overarching generic. There are no changes to the proposed types of information collection or uses of data as described in the overarching generic. The title of the collection has been updated from ACF Mandatory Grant Programs to ACF Non-Discretionary Grant Programs. This request also includes updates to three of the collections approved under this generic (GenICs): the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) ACF-696 Financial Report for States and Territories, the CCDF ACF-696T Financial Report for Tribal Grantees, and the Child Support Services Program Financial Reporting Forms (OCSS-34 and OCSS-396). Finally, burden estimates for the next 3 years have been adjusted based on use to date.
