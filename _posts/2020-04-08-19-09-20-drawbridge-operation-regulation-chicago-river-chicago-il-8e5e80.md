## Summary

The Coast Guard authorizes the Amtrak Railroad Bridge, mile 3.77, across the South Branch of the Chicago River, to be operated remotely and establish an intermediate opening position. The request was made by the bridge owner. This test deviation will test if the intermediate position improves vessel flow through the river. The bridge will continue to open on signal for commercial and recreational vessels.
