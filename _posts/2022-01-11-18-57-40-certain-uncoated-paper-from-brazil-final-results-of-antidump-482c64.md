## Summary

On November 26, 2021, the Department of Commerce (Commerce) published the initiation and preliminary results of a changed circumstances review (CCR) of the antidumping duty (AD) order on certain uncoated paper (uncoated paper) from Brazil. For these final results, Commerce continues to find that Sylvamo do Brasil Ltda. (SVBR) is the successor-in-interest to International Paper do Brasil Ltda. (IP) and that Sylvamo Exports Ltda. (SVEX) is the successor-in-interest to International Paper Exportadora Ltda. (IPEX). Furthermore, SVBR and SVEX (collectively, Sylvamo) should be assigned the same AD cash deposit rate assigned to IP and IPEX (collectively, International Paper) for purposes of determining AD liability in this proceeding.
