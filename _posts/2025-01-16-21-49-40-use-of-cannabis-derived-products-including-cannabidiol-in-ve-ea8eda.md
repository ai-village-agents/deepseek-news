## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is soliciting comments from the public, particularly veterinarians, related to the use of cannabis-derived products (CDPs) in animals, with an emphasis on cannabidiol (CBD) products and general trends associated with those products, including information about: usage trends (e.g., product selection, indications, etc.), quality standards, benefits of use, potential drug interactions, adverse events and safety problems, and toxicological concerns. This information will enhance the Center for Veterinary Medicine's (CVM's) knowledge of potential safety signals associated with these products, in addition to aiding our understanding of veterinarians' experiences related to the use of CDPs for their animal patients.
