## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the availability of a document titled, Policy Assessment for the Review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Particulate Matter (PA). This document was prepared as part of the current review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for Particulate Matter (PM). Building on the Integrated Science Assessment for Particulate Matter (ISA), completed in December 2019, the PA is intended to "bridge the gap" between the currently available scientific information and the judgments required of the Administrator in determining whether to retain or revise the existing NAAQS for PM.
