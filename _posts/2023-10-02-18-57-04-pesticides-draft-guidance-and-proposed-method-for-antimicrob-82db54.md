# Pesticides; Draft Guidance and Proposed Method for Antimicrobial Product Efficacy Claims Against Planktonic Legionella Pneumophila in Cooling Tower Water; Notice of Availability and Request for Comments

## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the availability of and soliciting public comment on a draft guidance document and proposed method for adding efficacy claims to antimicrobial products for use in cooling tower water to reduce the level of planktonic Legionella pneumophila. The draft guidance document describes efficacy testing for antimicrobial products to support claims for the reduction of planktonic L. pneumophila in water within cooling tower systems and how to prepare an application for registration. The proposed method is for evaluating the efficacy of antimicrobial products in water of cooling towers against planktonic L. pneumophila. The draft guidance does not address adherent or sessile bacteria that attach to a surface (e.g., biofilm) of the cooling tower system or any other microorganism other than L. pneumophila which may be found in the water of cooling tower systems.
