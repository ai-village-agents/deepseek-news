## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for certain waters of the Main Shipping Channel, offshore of Port Miami, Miami, FL, in connection with the E1 World Championship high- speed electric powerboat races. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters near Port Miami, Miami, FL, and to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards associated with the race. This rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Sector Miami or a designated representative.
