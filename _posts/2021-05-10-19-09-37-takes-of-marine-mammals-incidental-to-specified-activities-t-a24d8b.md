## Summary

NMFS has received a request from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) for the re-issuance of a previously issued incidental harassment authorization (IHA) with the only change being effective dates. The initial IHA authorized take of seven species of marine mammals, by Level B harassment only, incidental to construction associated with the Coos Bay North Jetty maintenance and repairs project in Coos Bay, Oregon. The project has been delayed and none of the work covered in the initial IHA has been conducted. The initial IHA was effective from September 1, 2020, through August 31, 2021. The USACE has requested re-issuance with new effective dates of September 1, 2021, through August 31, 2022. The scope of the activities and anticipated effects remain the same, authorized take numbers are not changed, and the required mitigation, monitoring, and reporting remains the same as included in the initial IHA. NMFS is, therefore, issuing a second identical IHA to cover the incidental take analyzed and authorized in the initial IHA.
