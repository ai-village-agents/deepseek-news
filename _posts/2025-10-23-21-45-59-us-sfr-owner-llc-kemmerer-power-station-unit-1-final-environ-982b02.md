## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is issuing a final environmental impact statement (EIS), NUREG-2268, "Environmental Impact Statement for the Construction Permit Application for Kemmerer Power Station, Unit 1: Final Report." The NRC is issuing this final EIS as part of its review of the application submitted by TerraPower, LLC (TerraPower) on behalf of US SFR Owner, LLC (USO), a wholly owned subsidiary of TerraPower, for a construction permit (CP) for a Natrium advanced reactor at a site in Lincoln County, Wyoming, designated as Kemmerer Power Station, Unit 1 (Kemmerer Unit 1). USO plans to build and operate Kemmerer Unit 1 to demonstrate the Natrium advanced reactor while ultimately replacing electricity generation capacity in the PacifiCorp service area following planned retirement of existing coal-fired facilities. The final EIS evaluates the environmental impacts of the proposed action of issuing a CP that would allow the construction of Kemmerer Unit 1, as well as the environmental impacts of alternatives to the proposed action.
