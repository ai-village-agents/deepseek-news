## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Embraer S.A. (Embraer) Model EMB-505 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by analysis of certain monuments (the right- hand refreshment center and left-hand forward cabinet) that identified the need for installing structural reinforcements and replacing certain floor support rivets. This proposed AD would require installing structural reinforcements on certain monuments and replacing certain floor support rivets, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
