## Summary

In accordance with the Great Lakes Pilotage Act of 1960, the Coast Guard is establishing new base pilotage rates for the 2021 shipping season. This final rule will adjust the pilotage rates to account for changes in district operating expenses, an increase in the number of pilots, and anticipated inflation. The rule makes one change to the ratemaking methodology to account for actual inflation in step 4. Additionally, the rule excludes legal fees incurred in litigation against the Coast Guard regarding ratemaking from necessary and reasonable pilot association operating expenses. When combined with the changes above, this results in a 7-percent net increase in pilotage costs compared to the 2020 season.
