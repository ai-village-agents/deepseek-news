## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by Georgia, through the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (GA EPD), on September 16, 2019, for the purpose of removing certain transportation control measures (TCMs) from the SIP for the thirteen counties in the Atlanta, Georgia, area. EPA is also approving Georgia's update to the 2008 8- hour ozone maintenance plan that was submitted in the September 16, 2019, SIP revision. Specifically, EPA is approving the updated mobile emissions inventory, the associated 2030 motor vehicle emissions budgets (MVEBs), and the measures offsetting the potential emissions increases due to removal of the TCMs from the Georgia SIP. This approval is based on the determination that this SIP revision will not interfere with attainment or maintenance of any national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or standards) or any other Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) requirements.
