## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) debarring Harpreet Singh for a period of 10 years from importing or offering for import any drug into the United States. FDA bases this order on a finding Mr. Singh was convicted of multiple felony offenses, which serve as the basis for this debarment, that are conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cathinone, tapentadol, tramadol, and carisoprodol; one felony count under Federal law for fraudulent importation and transportation of goods; one felony count under Federal law for conspiracy to launder money; and one felony count under Federal law for conspiracy to obstruct justice. The factual basis supporting Mr. Singh's conviction, as described below, is conduct relating to the importation into the United States of a drug or controlled substance. Mr. Singh was given notice of the proposed debarment and was given an opportunity to request a hearing to show why he should not be debarred. As of November 20, 2024 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Mr. Singh had not responded. Mr. Singh's failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this matter.
