## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A320-214, -232, and -271N airplanes, and Model A321-231 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of a production line inspection finding of damage on a main landing gear (MLG) side stay attachment outboard lug. This AD requires an inspection for discrepancies of the MLG side stay attachment outboard lugs, left-hand and right-hand sides, and applicable corrective action, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
