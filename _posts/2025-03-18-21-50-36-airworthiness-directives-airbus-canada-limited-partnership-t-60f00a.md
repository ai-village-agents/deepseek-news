## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500-1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a design review that discovered software protection logic for potential large leaks from the engine bleed duct inside the engine core compartments was partially impaired. This AD requires revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to incorporate the procedures for the flightcrew to manually isolate the opposite functional engine in the event of an engine bleed duct large leak condition, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is incorporated by reference (IBR). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
