## Summary

By this rule, the Department of Justice ("the Department") is proposing regulations that implement the Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child Pornography Victim Assistance Act of 2018 ("the AVAA Act" or "the Act"). The Act established the Child Pornography Victims Reserve ("Reserve") to provide defined monetary assistance to eligible individuals who are depicted in child pornography that is the basis for certain convictions. The Reserve provides payment to such child pornography victims based on orders obtained in United States district courts. By statute, eligibility determinations are made by courts. Under this proposed rule, a claimant may choose to request that the Department present an application for a court order. This proposed rule provides procedures for the submission of requests and court orders to the Department related to payments from the Reserve. The Department will provide payment from the Reserve to the victim pursuant to a court order issued, upon receipt of the order and the requisite information from the claimant following instructions on the Department's website for this program.
