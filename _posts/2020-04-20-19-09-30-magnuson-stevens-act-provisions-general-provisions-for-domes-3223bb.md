## Summary

The Regional Administrator, West Coast Region, NMFS, has made a preliminary determination that an application for an Exempted Fishing Permit warrants further consideration. The application, submitted by the California Wetfish Producers Association, requests an exemption from the prohibition on directed fishing for Pacific sardine during the remainder of the 2019-2020 fishing year and the upcoming 2020-2021 fishing year. The goal of this research is to collect fishery-dependent data for potential use in the 2021 and 2022 Pacific sardine stock assessments. NMFS requests public comment on the application.
