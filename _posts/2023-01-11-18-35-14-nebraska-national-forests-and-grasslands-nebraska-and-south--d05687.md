## Summary

The Forest Service, USDA, will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to address undesirable plant management for the Nebraska National Forests and Grasslands (Forests). This environmental analysis is necessary to protect, maintain, or restore native plant communities from the negative effects of undesirable plants. The proposal will analyze an update of the Forests' guidance from the May 1993 Environmental Assessment (EA) for the Management of Undesirable Plant Species.
