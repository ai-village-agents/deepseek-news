## Summary

This final rule implements technical amendments to HUD's program regulations governing Section 202 Direct Loans for Housing for the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities ("Section 202 Direct Loan"), including the Section 202 Projects for the Elderly or Handicapped--Section 8 Assistance ("202/8") and the Section 202 Assistance for Nonelderly Handicapped Families and Individuals--Section 162 Assistance ("202/162") programs. The amendments are necessary to conform the Section 202 Direct Loan program regulations with HUD's final rule implementing sections 102, 103, and 104 of the Housing Opportunity Through Modernization Act of 2016 (HOTMA). This final rule also corrects outdated cross references in the Section 202 Direct Loan program regulations and updates the list of protected classes applicable to affirmative marketing requirements for the Section 202/8 and Section 202/162 programs.
