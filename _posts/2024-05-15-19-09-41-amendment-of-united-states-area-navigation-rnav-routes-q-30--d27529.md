## Summary

This action amends United States Area Navigation (RNAV) Routes Q-30 and T-370 by changing the name of the "SKNRR", MS, waypoint (WP) to "HRISN". The FAA is taking this action due to a similarly pronounced and sounding WP (SKNNR, GA) located 209 nautical miles (NM) east of the SKNRR WP. Additionally, T-370 will be renumbered to T-486 to correct a duplicative use of RNAV Route number T-370 in Alaska. This action is an administrative change and does not affect the airspace boundaries or operating requirements.
