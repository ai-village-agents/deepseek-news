## Summary

This proposed rule would set forth a number of provisions to strengthen the oversight of accrediting organizations (AOs) by addressing conflicts of interest, establishing consistent standards, processes and definitions, and updating the validation and performance standards systems. Additionally, this proposed rule would revise the psychiatric hospital survey process, add a limitation on terminated deemed providers and suppliers when reentering the program, and provides technical corrections for End-Stage Renal Disease facilities and Kidney Transplant Programs. This proposed rule also solicits comments from stakeholders and AOs to refine and revise the AO oversight standards and processes. In addition, this proposed rule includes a request for information on the timeframes and expectations for the submission of AO applications.
