## Summary

The Drug Enforcement Administration is proposing the control of the chemical 2-methyl-3-phenyloxirane-2-carboxylic acid (also known as P2P methyl glycidic acid and BMK glycidic acid) and its esters, its optical and geometric isomers, its salts, salts of its optical and geometric isomers and its esters, and any combination thereof, whenever the existence of such is possible, as a list I chemical under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). P2P methyl glycidic acid is important to the manufacture of the schedule II controlled substances phenylacetone (also known as phenyl-2-propanone or P2P), methamphetamine, and amphetamine, and it is used in clandestine laboratories to illicitly manufacture these controlled substances. If finalized, this proposed rule would subject handlers of P2P methyl glycidic acid to the chemical regulatory provisions of the CSA and its implementing regulations. This rulemaking does not establish a threshold for domestic and international transactions of P2P methyl glycidic acid. As such, all transactions of P2P methyl glycidic acid, regardless of size, shall be regulated. In addition, chemical mixtures containing P2P methyl glycidic acid are not exempt from regulatory requirements at any concentration. Therefore, all transactions of chemical mixtures containing any quantity of P2P methyl glycidic acid shall be regulated pursuant to the CSA. However, manufacturers may submit an application for exemption for those mixtures that do not qualify for automatic exemption.
