## Summary

The OCC, the Board, and the FDIC (the agencies) seek public input on sources of regulatory reporting burden for institutions that currently file the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Report) (FFIEC 031, FFIEC 041, and FFIEC 051). This request for information (RFI) offers the opportunity for interested stakeholders to identify ways that the agencies could streamline the Call Report forms and instructions while still meeting the purposes of the collection.
