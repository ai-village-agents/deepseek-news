## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") and the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") (collectively, "we" or "Commissions") are adopting amendments to Form PF, the confidential reporting form for certain SEC-registered investment advisers to private funds, including those that also are registered with the CFTC as a commodity pool operator ("CPO") or commodity trading adviser ("CTA"). The amendments correct certain errors in Form PF.
