## Summary

The Flathead Resource Advisory Committee (RAC) will meet in Kalispell, Montana. The committee is authorized under the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act (the Act) and operates in compliance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The purpose of the committee is to improve collaborative relationships and to provide advice and recommendations to the Forest Service concerning projects and funding consistent with Title II of the Act. In June 2016, the National Secure Rural Schools (SRS) Resource Advisory Committee (RAC) charter enabled SRS RACs to provide recommendations on Forest Service recreation fee proposals; if the designated Units are not currently coordinating with another active Recreation RAC; the current charter states that upon request of the Designated Federal Officer (DFO), the SRS RAC may make recommendations regarding: a. The implementation of a new recreation fee at specific recreation fee site; b. The implementation of a fee increase at an existing recreation fee; c. The implementation or elimination of noncommercial, individual special recreation permit fees; d. The elimination of a recreation fee; and, e. The expansion or limitation of the recreation fee program. RAC information can be found at the following website: https:// www.fs.usda.gov/main/pts/home.
