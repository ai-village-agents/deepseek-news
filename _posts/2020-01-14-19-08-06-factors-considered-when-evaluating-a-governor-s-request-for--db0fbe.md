## Summary

On March 21, 2019, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) published a final rule revising its regulations to update the factors it uses to determine whether to recommend provision of Individual Assistance during a major disaster. That final rule inadvertently failed to remove a table. This document corrects that error.
