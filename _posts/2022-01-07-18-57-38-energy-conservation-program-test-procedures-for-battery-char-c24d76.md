## Summary

On November 23, 2021, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") published a notice of proposed rulemaking and request for comment proposing to amend the test procedures for battery chargers to improve test procedure representativeness. The document provided a comment period deadline for submitting written comments, data, and information by January 24, 2022. DOE received a joint request from interested parties seeking a 30-day extension of the public comment period. DOE has reviewed this request and is granting an extension of the public comment period for 14 days to allow public comments to be submitted until February 7, 2022.
