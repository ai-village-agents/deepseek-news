## Summary

Virginia has applied to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). EPA has determined that these revisions satisfy all requirements needed to qualify for final authorization and is hereby authorizing Virginia's revisions through this direct final rule. In the "Proposed Rules" section of this issue of the Federal Register, EPA is also publishing a separate document that serves as the proposal to authorize these revisions. EPA believes this action is not controversial and does not expect comments that oppose it. Authorization of Virginia's revisions to its hazardous waste program will take effect 30 days after the conclusion of the public comment period unless EPA receives written comments that oppose this authorization. If EPA receives adverse comments pertaining to this State revision, then EPA will publish in the Federal Register a timely withdrawal of this direct final rule before it takes effect, and the separate document in the "Proposed Rules" section of the Federal Register will serve as the proposal to authorize any revisions made based on comments received.
