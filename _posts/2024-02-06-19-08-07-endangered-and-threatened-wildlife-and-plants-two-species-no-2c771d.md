## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce findings that two species are not warranted for listing as endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). After a thorough review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that it is not warranted at this time to list the north Oregon coast distinct population segment (DPS) of the red tree vole (Arborimus longicaudus) and Plateau spot-tailed earless lizard (Holbrookia lacerata). However, we ask the public to submit to us at any time any new information relevant to the status of either of the species mentioned above or their habitats.
