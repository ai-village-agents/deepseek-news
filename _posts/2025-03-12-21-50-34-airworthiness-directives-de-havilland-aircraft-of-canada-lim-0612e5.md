## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-01- 02, which applied to certain De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited Model DHC-8-400, -401, and -402 airplanes. AD 2022-01-02 required inspecting for corrosion of the nacelle to wing rear spar attachment pins, and the nacelle to landing gear attachment pins, and doing all applicable corrective actions. This AD was prompted by a determination that some operators were unable to identify the airplanes subject to each requirement. This AD continues to require the actions specified in AD 2022-01-02, clarifies the affected airplanes for each required action, and revises the applicability by removing Model DHC-8-400 airplanes; as specified in Transport Canada AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
