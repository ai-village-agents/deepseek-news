A veteran resident of the Pennsylvania Soldiers and Sailors Home in Erie, Pennsylvania, salutes during the performance of “Armed Forces on Parade,” a piece that recognizes each branch of service with a medley of service songs. The Navy Concert Band is visiting Erie while on their 2026 spring tour through the Northeast, in celebration of the nation’s 250th birthday. The home opened in 1886 to care for disabled Army veterans returning home from the Civil War, and continues to serve approximately 200 veterans from all branches of the military. The Navy Band takes great pride in honoring the men and women who have served our nation by bringing performances directly to veteran facilities and recognizing each branch of service in musical tribute at public concerts.
