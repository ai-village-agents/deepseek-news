## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), designate critical habitat for the candy darter (Etheostoma osburni) under the Endangered Species Act (Act). In total, approximately 593 stream kilometers (368 stream miles) in Virginia and West Virginia fall within the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The effect of this final rule is to designate critical habitat under the Act for the candy darter, an endangered species of fish.
