# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus SAS Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that during an inspection of the flight deck escape hatches it was found that they were difficult to open from the inside, and several hatches were found impossible to open from the outside. Subsequent investigation revealed corrosion on the flight deck escape hatch mechanism due to condensation penetrating inside the mechanism. This proposed AD would require replacing all affected flight deck escape hatches with serviceable hatches, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
