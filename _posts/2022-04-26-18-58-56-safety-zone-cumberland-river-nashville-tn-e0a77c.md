## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to a temporary safety zone from mile marker 191.1 to 191.5 of the Cumberland River. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters near Korean Veterans Bridge, Nashville, TN, during Music City Grand Prix on August 5 through August 7, 2022. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Sector Ohio Valley (COTP) or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
