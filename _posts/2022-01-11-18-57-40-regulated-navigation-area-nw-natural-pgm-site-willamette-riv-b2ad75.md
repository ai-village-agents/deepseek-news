## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a regulated navigation area (RNA) at the NW Natural PGM Site on the Willamette River in Portland, OR. This action is necessary to preserve the integrity of an engineered sediment cap as part of an Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) required remedial action. This regulation prohibits persons and vessels from activities in the RNA that could disturb or damage the engineered sediment cap unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Sector Columbia River or a designated representative.
