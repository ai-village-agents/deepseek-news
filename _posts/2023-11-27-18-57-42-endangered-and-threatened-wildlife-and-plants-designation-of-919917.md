## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are reopening the public comment period on our August 10, 2023, proposed rule to designate critical habitat for the Sacramento Mountains checkerspot butterfly (Euphydryas anicia cloudcrofti), a butterfly from New Mexico, under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). We are taking this action to conduct a public hearing and to allow all interested parties additional time to comment on the proposal to designate critical habitat for the Sacramento Mountains checkerspot butterfly.
