## Summary

On November 20, 2025, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) published a notice announcing the launch of a fee- funded modernized alternative identity verification program for individuals who present at the TSA checkpoint without the required acceptable form of identification (AFOID), such as a REAL ID or passport. TSA is announcing the rebranding of the modernized program now identified as "TSA Confirm.ID". To address the government- incurred costs of operating the new program, including an updated review and revision of relevant population estimates and costs, TSA sets the TSA Confirm.ID program fee for individuals who choose to use the program to $45.00.
