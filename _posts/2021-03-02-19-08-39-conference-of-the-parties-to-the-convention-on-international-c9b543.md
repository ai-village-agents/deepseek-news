## Summary

To implement the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES or the Convention), the Parties to the Convention meet periodically to review what species in international trade should be regulated and other aspects of CITES implementation. The nineteenth regular meeting of the Conference of the Parties (CoP19) is tentatively scheduled to be held in Costa Rica, March 3-14, 2022. With this notice we are soliciting recommendations for amending Appendices I and II of CITES at CoP19 as well as recommendations for resolutions, decisions, and agenda items for discussion at CoP19. We invite you to provide us with information and recommendations on animal and plant species for which the United States should consider submitting proposals to amend Appendices I and II of CITES at CoP19. Such proposals may concern the addition of species to Appendix I or II, the transfer of species from one Appendix to another, or the removal of species from Appendices. We also invite you to provide us with information and recommendations on resolutions, decisions, and agenda items that the United States might consider submitting for discussion at CoP19. Finally, with this notice, we also describe the U.S. approach to preparations for CoP19.
