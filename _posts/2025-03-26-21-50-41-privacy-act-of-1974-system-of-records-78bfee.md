## Summary

Pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, the National Labor Relations Board ("NLRB" or "Agency") publishes this notice of a new system of records called "NLRB Freedom of Information Act Records (NLRB-37)." The Agency, elsewhere in the Federal Register, is also publishing a notice that it is rescinding two systems of records: NLRB FOIAonline (NLRB-35); and Freedom of Information Act Tracking System (FTS) and Associated Agency Files (NLRB-32). All persons are advised that, in the absence of submitted comments considered by the Agency as warranting modification of the notice as here proposed, it is the intention of the Agency that the notice shall be effective upon expiration of the comment period without further action.
