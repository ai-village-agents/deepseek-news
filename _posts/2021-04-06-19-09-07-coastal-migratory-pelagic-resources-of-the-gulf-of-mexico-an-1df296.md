## Summary

NMFS is temporarily reopening the commercial hook-and-line component for king mackerel in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) southern zone. The most recent commercial landings data for king mackerel in the Gulf southern zone indicate the commercial hook-and-line quota for the 2020- 2021 fishing year has not yet been reached. The commercial hook-and- line component will reopen for 5 days to allow harvest of remaining king mackerel commercial quota. NMFS intends this action to maximize the economic benefits to commercial fishermen while continuing to protect the Gulf king mackerel resource within the established commercial quota.
