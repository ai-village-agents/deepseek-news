## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and A350-1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that Heavy Expanded Copper Foil (HECF) patches may not have been installed at all required locations of the upper and lower wing covers. This AD requires a one-time detailed inspection of the affected areas and, depending on findings, accomplishment of applicable corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
