## Summary

In keeping with ongoing efforts to increase the number of small and underserved businesses participating in the USDA food procurement program, as well as increasing access to culturally appropriate foods, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is seeking public input on perceived barriers that small businesses, those owned by underserved businesses, and providers of organic, kosher, and halal agricultural products face in working with AMS' Commodity Procurement Program (CPP). This input will be used to update CPP's Small Business and New Vendor Strategy as appropriate.
