## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in response to a request under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended, from Trident Seafoods Corporation, propose to authorize nonlethal incidental take by harassment of small numbers of the Southwest Alaska stock of northern sea otters (Enhydra lutris kenyoni) for 1 year from the date of issuance of the incidental harassment authorization. The applicant requested this authorization for take by harassment that may result from activities associated with pile driving and marine construction activities in Near Island Channel in Kodiak, Alaska. We estimate that this project may result in the nonlethal incidental take by harassment of up to 460 northern sea otters from the Southwest Alaska stock. This proposed authorization, if finalized, will be for up to 3,160 takes of 460 northern sea otters by Level B harassment. No take by Level A harassment or lethal take are requested, or expected, and no such take will be authorized.
