## Summary

The Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation (OPRE) within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is proposing revisions to data collection activities conducted for the Next Generation of Enhanced Employment Strategies (NextGen) Project, which is rigorously evaluating innovative interventions designed to promote employment and economic security among low-income individuals with complex challenges to employment. The project includes an experimental impact study, descriptive study, and cost study. The project is seeking clearance for changes to the previously approved Phase 1 instruments, updates to the previously approved consent form, and clearance for a parent/guardian consent form and a youth assent form for use in evaluations of programs for youth. The project also seeks approval to use a subset of Phase 2 instruments with programs selected for inclusion in the project with some changes made to those instruments. The requested changes do not change the previously submitted burden estimates.
