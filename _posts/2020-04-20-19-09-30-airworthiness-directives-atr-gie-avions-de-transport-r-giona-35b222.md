## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain ATR--GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR72 airplanes. This AD was prompted by occurrences of smoke in the flight deck and flap extension difficulties due to wire chafing on the electrical harness under a certain panel. This AD requires modifying the clamp installation of the electrical routing on a certain rib of the left- and right-hand side of the wing rear spars, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
