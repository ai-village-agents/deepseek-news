## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a recurring safety zone for certain waters of Apra Outer Harbor. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters near Apra Harbor, Guam, during fireworks displays. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from entering the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Guam (COTP) or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
