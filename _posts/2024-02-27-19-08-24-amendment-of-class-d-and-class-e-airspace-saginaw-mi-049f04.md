## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class D and Class E airspace at Saginaw, MI. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of airspace reviews conducted as part of the decommissioning of the Mount Pleasant very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program. This action would also update the names and the geographic coordinates of various airports to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database. This action will bring the airspace into compliance with FAA orders and support instrument flight rule (IFR) procedures and operations.
