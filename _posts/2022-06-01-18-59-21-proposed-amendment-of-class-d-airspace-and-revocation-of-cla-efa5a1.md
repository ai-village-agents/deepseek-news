## Summary

This action proposes to amend Class D airspace and remove Class E airspace area designated as an extension to Class D airspace in Fort Pierce, FL, as the Fort Pierce non-directional beacon (NDB) has been decommissioned and associated approaches into Treasure Coast International Airport cancelled. This action would also update the airport's name and geographic coordinates. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.
