## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of oxirane, 2-methyl-, polymer with oxirane, di-(9Z)-9-octadecenoate (CAS Reg. No. 67167-17-3) average number molecular weight (in amu), 2500 when used as an inert ingredient in a pesticide chemical formulation. Ethox Chemicals, LLC, submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of oxirane, 2-methyl-, polymer with oxirane, di-(9Z)-9- octadecenoate on food or feed commodities.
