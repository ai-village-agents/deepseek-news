## Summary

The National Advisory Council on the National Health Service Corps (NACNHSC) meeting scheduled for Tuesday, June 16, 2020, and Wednesday, June 17, 2020, has changed its format, date, and time. The decision to change the NACNHSC meeting has been made after carefully examining the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendations to restrict all non-essential travel, and the widespread health risks posed by COVID-19 to the American public. The public meeting will now be a one-day webinar and conference call held only on Tuesday, June 16, 2020, from 9:30 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Eastern Time. The webinar link, conference dial-in number, meeting materials, and updates will be available on the NACNHSC website: https:// nhsc.hrsa.gov/about/national-advisory-council-nhsc/index.html.
