## Summary

This final rule adopts, with changes, a proposed rule amending the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance Traumatic Injury Protection (TSGLI) program regulations. This final rule allows nurse practitioners to sign a hospital or facility- approved pass for a member to leave a hospital or treating facility as part of the member's treatment plan. This final rule also responds to comments received during a reopened 60-day comment period on the response to a petition for rulemaking and withdraws a proposed revision to the TSGLI schedule of losses for traumatic injuries from burns.
