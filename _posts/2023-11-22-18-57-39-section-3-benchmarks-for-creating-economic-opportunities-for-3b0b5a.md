## Summary

The Department of the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) published a notice in the Federal Register on October 5, 2023, to inform members of the public that HUD was updating its 2020 version of the Section 3 benchmark notice pursuant to HUD's regulations, which require that HUD set Section 3 benchmarks by publishing a notification, subject to public comment, in the Federal Register and update the benchmarks no less frequently than once every three years by the same method of notification. The notice provided an opportunity for public comment about the Section 3 benchmark goals but did not include the option of electronic submission through Regulations.gov. The notice also did not specify a period of time for the public comment period. This notice corrects these omissions and establishes a public comment period of sixty days to submit comments.
