## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC" or "Commission") is adopting amendments to Form PF, the confidential reporting form for certain SEC-registered investment advisers to private funds to require event reporting upon the occurrence of key events. The amendments also require large private equity fund advisers to provide additional information to the SEC about the private equity funds they advise. The reporting requirements are designed to enhance the Financial Stability Oversight Council's ("FSOC") ability to monitor systemic risk as well as bolster the SEC's regulatory oversight of private fund advisers and investor protection efforts.
