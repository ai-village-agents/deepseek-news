## Summary

NMFS has received a request from the U.S. Navy on behalf of NOAA Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO) for an incidental harassment authorization (IHA) that would authorize take for a subset of activities in an IHA previously issued to OMAO to incidentally take marine mammals from construction activities at Naval Station (NAVSTA) Newport, Rhode Island, by Level B harassment only. Pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), NMFS is requesting comments on its proposal to issue an IHA to incidentally take marine mammals during the specified activities. NMFS is also requesting comments on a possible 1- year renewal IHA that could be issued under certain circumstances and if all requirements are met, as described in Request for Public Comments at the end of this notice. NMFS will consider public comments prior to making any final decision on the issuance of the requested MMPA authorizations and agency responses will be summarized in the final notice of our decision.
