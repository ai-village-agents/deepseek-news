## Summary

The Maritime Administration (MARAD) invites public comments on our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The proposed collection OMB 2133-0011 (War Risk Insurance, Applications and Related Information) is used to determine the eligibility of the applicant and the vessel(s) for participation in the War Risk Insurance program. There are no changes to this collection since the last renewal. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 requires that we publish this notice in the Federal Register to obtain comments from the public and affected agencies.
