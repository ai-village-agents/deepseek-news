# Strengthening the Ability of Consumers To Stop Robocalls

## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) seeks comment on whether the Telephone Consumer Protection (TCPA) applies to robocalls and robotexts from wireless providers to their own subscribers and therefore whether such providers must have consent to make robocalls and send robotexts to their own subscribers. To the extent that wireless providers have consent to robocall or robotext their own subscribers, the Commission seeks comment on whether wireless subscribers can exercise their right to revoke such consent by communicating a revocation of consent request to their wireless provider and that such requests must be honored. In addition, the Commission seeks comment on a request to require automated opt-out mechanisms on every call that uses an artificial or prerecorded voice.
