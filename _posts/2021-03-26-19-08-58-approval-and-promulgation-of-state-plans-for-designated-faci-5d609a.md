## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA or the "Act"), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the "Agency") is proposing approval of a CAA section 111(d) plan submitted by the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality (NDDEQ or the "Department") on July 28, 2020 to regulate landfill gas and its components from existing municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills. The EPA is also proposing approval of a CAA section 111(d)/129 plan submitted by the Department on the same date to regulate air pollutants from existing commercial and industrial solid waste incineration (CISWI) units and air curtain incinerators (ACI). These plans provide for the State's implementation and enforcement of the federal emission guidelines (EG) for existing MSW landfills, CISWI units and ACI in North Dakota. The EPA with this proposed rule is also notifying the public that the Agency has received a request from the State of North Dakota, dated May 8, 2019, for withdrawal of a previously approved CAA section 111(d)/129 plan for hospital/medical/infectious waste incineration (HMIWI) units and for Agency approval of a negative declaration of such units within the State. Approval of this negative declaration will stand in lieu of a North Dakota CAA section 111(d)/129 plan for HMIWI units.
