## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves an aircraft operator's request for a privacy ICAO address through a web-based application process. The information to be collected is necessary to qualify for the authorized use of the privacy ICAO address services and for monitoring to support continued airworthiness and enforcement activities.
