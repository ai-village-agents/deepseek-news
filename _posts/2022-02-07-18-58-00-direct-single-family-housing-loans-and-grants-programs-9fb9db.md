## Summary

The Rural Housing Service (RHS or Agency), a Rural Development agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), is issuing a final rule to amend its Direct Single Family Housing Loans and Grants (DSFHLG) programs regulation. This final rule adopts most changes as presented in the proposed rule published on November 25, 2019, in the Federal Register. This final rule also addresses public comments received by the Agency and makes some modifications based on consideration of those comments, including revisions to the refinancing provisions which will help provide relief to homeowners who have difficulty keeping their accounts current (e.g., coming off a payment moratorium), based on the availability of funds and Agency priorities.
