## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A330-200, A330-200 Freighter, A330-300, A330-800, A330-900, A340-500, and A340-600 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of temporary loss of the flight director (FD) and autothrottle (A/THR) on an airplane dispatched under the provisions of a master minimum equipment list (MMEL) item for fuel quantity indication (FQI). This AD requires revising the operator's existing FAA-approved minimum equipment list (MEL), as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
