## Summary

The FHWA is extending the comment period for a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) and request for comments, which was published on January 25, 2024. The original comment period is set to close on February 26, 2024. The extension is based on concern expressed by stakeholders that the February 26, 2024, closing date does not provide sufficient time to review and provide comprehensive comments. The FHWA recognizes that others interested in commenting may have similar concerns and agrees that the comment period should be extended. Therefore, the closing date for comments is changed to March 12, 2024, which will provide stakeholders and others interested in commenting additional time to discuss, evaluate, and submit responses to the docket.
