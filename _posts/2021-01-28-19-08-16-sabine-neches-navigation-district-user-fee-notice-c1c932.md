## Summary

The Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA) of 2014 authorizes a non-federal interest to levy port or harbor dues in the form of tonnage duties or fees in conjunction with a harbor navigation project whose usable increment of the project is complete to finance the cost, construction or maintenance of the project. The Sabine-Neches Navigation District (SNND) is a political subdivision of the State of Texas and the non-federal sponsor of the Sabine-Neches Waterway Channel Improvement Project (SNWW CIP). The SNND anticipates completion of the first usable increment of the SNWW CIP in early 2021. Upon completion of the first usable increment, SNND intends to levy port or harbor dues pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 2236. Notification in the Federal Register prior to an initial levy of port or harbor dues is required by the statute.
