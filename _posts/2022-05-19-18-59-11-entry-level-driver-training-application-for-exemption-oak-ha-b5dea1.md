## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to grant an exemption from the qualification requirements pertaining to entry-level driver training (ELDT) theory instructors for Oak Harbor's safety supervisor, Mr. Jeff McLaughlin. The exemption will allow Mr. McLaughlin to conduct classroom (theory) training for entry-level drivers who intend to operate commercial motor vehicles (CMV) used in the transportation of hazardous materials (HM). The exemption excuses Mr. McLaughlin from the requirement to either possess a commercial driver's license (CDL) or have previously held a CDL. The road portion of the training will be completed by behind-the-wheel (BTW) instructors that meet the ELDT qualification requirements. FMCSA concluded that granting the exemption is likely to achieve a level of safety equivalent to or greater than the level of safety that would be obtained in the absence of the exemption.
