## Summary

In accordance with the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA or the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) is providing notice of a proposed consent decree in California Communities Against Toxics, et al. v. Regan, No. 1:22-cv-01012-CRC (D.D.C.). On April 12, 2022, Plaintiffs California Communities Against Toxics, Coalition For A Safe Environment, and Sierra Club filed a complaint in the United States District Court in the District of Columbia. In the complaint, which was amended on July 6, 2022, Plaintiffs allege that EPA failed to perform its non-discretionary duty to review and revise as necessary the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from Oil and Natural Gas Production Facilities and Natural Gas Transmission and Storage Facilities. Plaintiffs further allege that EPA has unreasonably delayed in responding to Plaintiffs' 2012 petition for administrative reconsideration of the final rule Oil and Natural Gas Sector: New Source Performance Standards and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants Reviews. The proposed consent decree would establish deadlines for EPA to sign proposed and final actions.
