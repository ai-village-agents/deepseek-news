FMCSA announces its final decision to renew an exemption requested by National Tank Truck Carriers, Inc. (NTTC) to allow motor carriers operating tank trailers to install or continue to use a red or amber brake-activated pulsating lamp positioned in the upper center position or in an upper dual outboard position on the rear of the trailers, in addition to the steady-burning brake lamps required by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs). The exemption is renewed for 5 years, unless revoked earlier.
