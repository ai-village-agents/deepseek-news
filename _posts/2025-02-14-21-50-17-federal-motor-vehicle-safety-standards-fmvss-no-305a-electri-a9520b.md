FMVSS No. 305a applies to light and heavy vehicles and includes performance requirements for the propulsion battery. The final rule also established a part entitled, "Documentation for Electric- powered Vehicles," that requires manufacturers to compile risk mitigation documentation and submit standardized emergency response information to assist first and second responders handling electric vehicles.
