## Summary

This notice sets forth the reasons for the denial of a defect petition, DP20-002, submitted by Mr. V.T. Wakefield (the Petitioner) to NHTSA (the Agency) by a letter dated December 12, 2019. The petition requested that the Agency initiate a safety defect investigation of passenger compartment fires attributed to HVAC blower motor connectors overheating in Model Year (MY) 2006-2010 Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky vehicles (the "subject vehicles"). After conducting a technical review of: (1) consumer complaints identified by the petitioner; (2) consumer complaint information in NHTSA's databases; and (3) information provided by General Motors (GM) in response to the Agency's information request regarding vehicle fires and complaints received by GM, NHTSA's Office of Defect Investigations (ODI) has concluded that the issues raised by the petition do not warrant a defect investigation. Accordingly, the Agency has denied the petition.
