## Summary

The Maritime Administration (MARAD) plans to provide for the use or disposition of the historic vessel, the Nuclear Ship NS Savannah, once decommissioning of the ship's nuclear reactor is completed. Due to the vessel's historic importance and the requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), MARAD is publishing this notice to solicit the public's views regarding MARAD's proposed uses for the Savannah and provide the public the opportunity to submit any alternative uses.
