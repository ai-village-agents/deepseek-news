## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Awardee Lead Profile Assessment (ALPA). The ALPA survey will serve to identify childhood lead poisoning-related laws and guidance, surveillance and prevention strategies, and program services including blood lead levels at what various case management activities are performed in children exposed to lead.
