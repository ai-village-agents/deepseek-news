## Summary

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) establishes the approximately 7,605-acre "Long Valley-Lake County" viticultural area in Lake County, California. Additionally, TTB is expanding the boundary of the established 14,000-acre High Valley viticultural area by approximately 1,542 acres in order to create a contiguous border with the Long Valley-Lake County viticultural area. Finally, TTB is modifying the boundary of the North Coast viticultural area to eliminate a partial overlap with the Long Valley-Lake County viticultural area. TTB designates viticultural areas to allow vintners to better describe the origin of their wines and to allow consumers to better identify wines they may purchase.
