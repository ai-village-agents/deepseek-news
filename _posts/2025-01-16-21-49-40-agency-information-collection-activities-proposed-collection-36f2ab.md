## Summary

The U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, intends to request approval of a new information collection from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. MSPB is submitting this Information Collection Request (ICR), entitled Accommodation Request Form, OMB Control No. 3124-0NEW, for approval in accordance with Federal regulations, and is requesting public comments. This collection was developed as part of MSPB's effort to streamline the process for collecting information from employees and applicants to MSPB, as well as participants in MSPB functions (parties and/or participants in MSPB appeals, respondents to surveys, and all other individuals engaged in activity conducted by the MSPB), who seek a reasonable accommodation in order for MSPB to carry out its functions with respect to these individuals. The purpose of this notice is to allow 60 days for public comment preceding submission of the collection to OMB.
