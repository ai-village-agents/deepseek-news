## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-12- 10, which applied to certain Dassault Aviation Model FALCON 7X airplanes. AD 2022-12-10 required revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to provide emergency procedures for inconsistent or unreliable flight data, emergency and abnormal operations procedures for the generic input/output (GEN I/O) internal module failure, and emergency procedures for additional information. AD 2022-12-10 also required revising the existing minimum equipment list (MEL) for the multi-function probe heating, air data, and inertial reference systems. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-12-10, the manufacturer developed modifications that fix a weak point in the avionics architecture. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2022-12-10 and removes certain airplanes from the applicability. This AD also requires modification of the avionics system and related revisions to the existing AFM and MEL. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
