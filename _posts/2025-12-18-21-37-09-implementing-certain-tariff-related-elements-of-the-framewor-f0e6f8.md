## Summary

On September 5, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14346 (Modifying the Scope of Reciprocal Tariffs and Establishing Procedures for Implementing Trade and Security Agreements). Executive Order 14346 directed and authorized the Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative to take the necessary and appropriate steps to implement any current or forthcoming trade and security framework agreements between a foreign trading partner and the United States. On November 14, 2025, the United States, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein announced a Framework to negotiate an Agreement on Fair, Balanced, and Reciprocal Trade, and have agreed to modification of certain tariff rates. This notice amends the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to implement the elements of the Framework to apply the higher of either the U.S. most-favored-nation tariff rate or a tariff rate of 15 percent, comprised of the most- favored-nation tariff and a reciprocal tariff, on products of Switzerland or Liechtenstein, and to adjust tariffs on certain articles that are products of Switzerland or Liechtenstein, including certain agricultural goods, unavailable natural resources, aircraft and aircraft parts, and generic pharmaceuticals and their ingredients and chemical precursors. The United States has agreed to modify these tariff rates with the understanding and expectation that the Agreement on Fair, Balanced, and Reciprocal Trade will be successfully negotiated by the first quarter of 2026. If the Agreement is not successfully negotiated by March 31, 2026, the United States will review and reconsider these modifications, as appropriate.
