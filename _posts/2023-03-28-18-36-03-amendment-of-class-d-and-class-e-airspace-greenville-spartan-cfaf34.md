## Summary

This action amends Class D airspace, Class E surface airspace, and Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface in the Greenville, Spartanburg, and Greer, SC areas due to the decommissioning of the Fairmont non-directional beacon (NDB) and cancellation of associated approaches into Spartanburg Downtown Memorial Airport/Simpson Field, as well as updating the airport's name and geographic coordinates. Additionally, this action updates the name, geographic coordinates, and airspace of Greenville Spartanburg International Airport, Greenville Downtown Airport, and Donaldson Field Airport. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.
