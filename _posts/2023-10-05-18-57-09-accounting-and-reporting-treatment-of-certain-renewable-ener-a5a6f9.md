## Summary

In this final rule, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission or FERC) is amending the Uniform System of Accounts (USofA) for public utilities and licensees to: create new accounts for wind, solar, and other renewable generating assets; create a new functional class for energy storage accounts; codify the accounting treatment of environmental credits; and create new accounts within existing functions for computer hardware, software, and communication equipment. We also amend the relevant FERC forms to accommodate these changes.
