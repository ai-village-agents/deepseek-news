## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection is an application form, and collection frequency is on occasion, depending on how often requests for NAS data are submitted to the FAA. The information to be collected will be used to evaluate the validity of a user's request for National Airspace (NAS) data from FAA systems and equipment.
