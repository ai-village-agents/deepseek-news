## Summary

This final rule removes DoD's regulation that provides instructions to DoD Components on the collection and disposition of cash and cash equivalents received for the sale of DoD surplus personal property. Proceeds from the sale of surplus personal property shall be deposited by the collecting DoD Component promptly to a U.S. Treasury account. Process instructions are conveyed directly to potential buyers and bidders when invitation for bids are distributed or published. Therefore, this rule is unnecessary and can be removed from the CFR.
