## Summary

This agenda announces the regulatory actions the Department of Defense (DoD) plans to take in the next 12 months and those regulatory actions completed since the publication of the fall 2021 Unified Agenda. It was developed under the guidelines of Executive Order 12866, "Regulatory Planning and Review," and Executive Order 13563, "Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review." This agenda includes regulatory actions that support or impact the Secretary of Defense's top priorities along with those of the National Defense Strategy to defend the Nation, take care of our people, succeed through teamwork, and address the current worldwide pandemic. These actions include efforts to ensure TRICARE beneficiaries have access to the most up-to- date care required for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. Members of the public may submit comments on individual proposed and interim final rulemakings at www.regulations.gov during the comment period that follows publication in the Federal Register. This agenda updates the report published on January 31, 2022, and includes regulations expected to be issued and under review over the next 12 months. The next agenda will publish in the fall of 2022. The complete Unified Agenda will be available online at www.reginfo.gov. In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 602), which requires agencies to publish its regulatory flexibility agendas in the Federal Register, the Department of Defense's printed agenda entries in the Federal Register include only: (1) rules that are in the Agency's regulatory flexibility agenda, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, because they are likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities; and (2) Any rules that the Agency has identified for periodic review under section 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Although printing of these entries is limited to fields that contain information required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act's agenda requirements, additional information on these entries is in the Unified Agenda available online.
