## Summary

The FAA is revising a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that applied to all The Boeing Company Model 757 airplanes. This action revises the NPRM by adding inspections for airplanes modified to a cargo configuration. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive (AD) to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over those in the NPRM, the FAA is requesting comments on this SNPRM.
