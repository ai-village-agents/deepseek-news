## Summary

The Division of Program Coordination, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives (DPCPSI) in the Office of the Director, National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking public comment regarding its proposal to transfer the All of Us (ALL) Research Program and Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Program from the Immediate Office of the NIH Director to DPCPSI in the Office of the Director, NIH. The program offices in DPCPSI share a common mission of identifying emerging scientific opportunities, rising public health challenges, or scientific knowledge gaps that deserve special emphasis. The proposed reorganization would align the important offices with offices having similar NIH-wide functions.
