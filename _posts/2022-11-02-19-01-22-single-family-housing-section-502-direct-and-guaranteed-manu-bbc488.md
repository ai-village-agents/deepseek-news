## Summary

The Rural Housing Service (RHS or the Agency), a Rural Development (RD) agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), is issuing this notice to waive two regulatory requirements for the Section 502 Direct and Guaranteed Manufactured Housing pilot program. The Agency's intention is to evaluate the existing regulations and remove regulatory barriers to assist eligible applicants with improved ease of use for very low- to moderate-income homeowners seeking to purchase affordable housing. The pilot also supports the current Administration's Housing Supply Action Plan which seeks to boost new financing mechanisms to build and supply quality affordable housing units. This notice briefly discusses the continuation of the existing waivers and provides contact information for additional details about the pilot program.
