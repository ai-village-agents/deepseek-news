## Summary

Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on December 5, 2024, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of Sch[uuml]tz Container Systems, Inc. of North Branch, New Jersey and Protechna S.A. of Fribourg, Switzerland. The complaint was supplemented on December 20, 2024. The complaint, as supplemented, alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain composite intermediate bulk containers by reason of the infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 9,718,581 ("the '581 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 8,708,150 ("the '150 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 8,919,562 ("the '562 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 8,567,626 ("the '626 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 9,004,310 ("the '310 patent"); and U.S. Patent No. 8,276,299 ("the'299 patent"). The complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The complainant requests that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a general exclusion order, in the alternative a limited exclusion order, and cease and desist orders.
