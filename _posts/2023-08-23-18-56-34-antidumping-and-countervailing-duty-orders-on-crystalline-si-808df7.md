## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) determines that, except as noted below, imports of certain crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells, whether or not assembled into modules (solar cells and modules), that have been completed in the Kingdom of Cambodia (Cambodia), Malaysia, the Kingdom of Thailand (Thailand), or the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (Vietnam), using parts and components produced in the People's Republic of China (China), as specified below, that are then subsequently exported from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, or Vietnam to the United States are circumventing the antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on solar cells and modules from China.
