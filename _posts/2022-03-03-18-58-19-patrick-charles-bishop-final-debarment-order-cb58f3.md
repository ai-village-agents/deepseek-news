## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) debarring Patrick Charles Bishop for a period of 5 years from importing or offering for import any drug into the United States. FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Bishop was convicted of one felony count under Federal law for conspiracy to commit fraud. The factual basis supporting Mr. Bishop's conviction, as described below, is conduct relating to the importation into the United States of a drug or controlled substance. Mr. Bishop was given notice of the proposed debarment and was given an opportunity to request a hearing to show why he should not be debarred. Mr. Bishop provided notice to FDA that he acquiesced to the debarment; FDA received that notice on January 4, 2022. As such, his debarment commenced on the date FDA was notified of acquiescence.
