## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-23- 04, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A300 B4-600R series airplanes; all Model A300-B4 603, B4-620, and B4-622 airplanes; all Model A300 C4-605R Variant F airplanes; and certain Model A300 F4-605R airplanes. AD 2017-23-04 required an inspection of the upper wing skin and top stringer joints, and modification of the stringer joint couplings if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2017-23-04, it has been determined that additional airplanes may be subject to the identified unsafe condition. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2017- 23-04 and adds airplanes. This AD also removes certain airplanes from the applicability. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
