## Summary

This final rule amends the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (Uniform Act) regulations. The revisions are prompted by enactment of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), which increased statutory relocation benefits and reduced length of occupancy requirements. This final rule updates existing regulations on the use of those provisions. The FHWA is also updating the Uniform Act regulations in response to comments received during this rulemaking's public comment period and to reflect the agency's experience with the Federal-aid highway program since the last comprehensive rulemaking for the part, which occurred in 2005. The updates include streamlining processes to better meet current Uniform Act implementation needs and eliminating duplicative and outdated regulatory language.
