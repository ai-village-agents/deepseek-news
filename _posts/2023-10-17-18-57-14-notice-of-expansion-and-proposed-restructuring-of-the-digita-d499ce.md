## Summary

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is committed to advancing digital opportunities in HUD-assisted communities by expanding its ConnectHomeUSA initiative to between 50 and 100 new communities. HUD's ConnectHome pilot program was launched in 2015 to address the "homework gap" for students in grades K-12 living in public and Indian housing. HUD partnered with interested public housing authorities and tribes to join forces with their city and tribal leadership to close this gap in twenty-eight HUD-assisted communities. Through this notice, HUD solicits comment on the expansion and restructuring of its demonstration program (ConnectHomeUSA) that is designed to further the collaborative efforts by government, industry, and nonprofit organizations to accelerate broadband internet adoption and use in HUD-assisted homes.
