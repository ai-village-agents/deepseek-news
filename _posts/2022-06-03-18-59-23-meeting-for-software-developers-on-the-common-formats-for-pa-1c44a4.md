## Summary

AHRQ coordinates the development of sets of standardized definitions and formats (Common Formats) that make it possible to collect, aggregate, and analyze uniformly structured information about health care quality and patient safety for local, regional, and national learning. The Common Formats include technical specifications to facilitate the collection of electronically comparable data by Patient Safety Organizations (PSOs) and other entities. Additional information about the Common Formats can be obtained through AHRQ's PSO website at https://pso.ahrq.gov/common-formats and the PSO Privacy Protection Center's website at https://www.psoppc.org/psoppc_web/ publicpages/commonFormatsOverview. The purpose of this notice is to announce a meeting to discuss implementation of the Common Formats with software developers and other interested parties. This meeting is designed as an interactive forum where software developers can provide input on use of the formats. AHRQ especially requests participation by and input from those entities which have used AHRQ's technical specifications and implemented, or plan to implement, the Common Formats electronically.
