## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing a Confirmatory Order to Holtec Decommissioning International, LLC (HDI) to memorialize the agreement reached during an alternative dispute resolution mediation session held on October 14, 2021. This Order will resolve any issues identified during an NRC inspection and investigation related to a (now-former) training superintendent at Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station (Oyster Creek), who was also responsible for performing armorer duties, and who deliberately failed to perform firearms maintenance activities and falsified records related to those activities. The Order includes a number of significant actions HDI has agreed to take that are expected to improve HDI's security performance at Oyster Creek and other sites in its fleet. The Confirmatory Order is effective upon issuance.
