## Summary

The United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO" or "Office") proposes regulations to govern the pre-issuance circulation and review of decisions within the Patent Trial and Appeal Board ("PTAB" or "Board"). The Office proposes these provisions to refine the current interim process in light of stakeholder feedback received in response to a Request for Comments (RFC). This proposed rule promotes the efficient delivery of reliable intellectual property rights by promoting consistent, clear, and open decision-making processes at the PTAB.
