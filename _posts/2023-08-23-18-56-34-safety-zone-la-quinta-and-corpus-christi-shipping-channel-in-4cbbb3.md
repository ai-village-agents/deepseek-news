## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary, moving safety zone for all navigable waters of the La Quinta and Corpus Christi Shipping Channel between gated pair lights 11 and 12 to the Sea buoy. The safety zone is needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards created by the rig NFE PIONEER I while it is towed offshore from the Kiewit Offshore Services facility. Entry of vessels or persons into this zone is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port Sector Corpus Christi or a designated representative.
