## Summary

On September 30, 2024, Rural Development's Rural Business- Cooperative Service, Rural Housing Service, and Rural Utilities Service, agencies of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), published a final rule with comment for the OneRD Guarantee Loan Program (OneRD). The final rule made necessary revisions to the policy and procedures that strengthened the oversight and management of the growing Community Facilities, Water and Waste Disposal, Business and Industry, and Rural Energy for America guarantee portfolios. Following implementation of this final rule, the Agency found that corrections were necessary due to an incorrect definition of affiliate, and a section and sentence that were removed erroneously. This document corrects the final regulation.
