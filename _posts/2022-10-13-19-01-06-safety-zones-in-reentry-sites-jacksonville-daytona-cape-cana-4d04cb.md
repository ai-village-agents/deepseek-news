## Summary

The Coast Guard is activating three safety zones for the SpaceX Commercial Crew-4 mission, reentry vehicle splashdown, and recovery operations. These operations will occur in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Our regulation for safety zones in reentry sites within the Seventh Coast Guard District identifies the regulated areas for this event. No U.S.-flagged vessel may enter the safety zones unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Jacksonville or a designated representative. Foreign-flagged vessels are encouraged to remain outside the safety zones.
