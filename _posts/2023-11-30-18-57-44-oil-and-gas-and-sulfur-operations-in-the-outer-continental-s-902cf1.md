## Summary

BSEE proposes to incorporate documents by reference (Production Measurement Industry Standards and Safety Industry Standards, including one International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission standard) into the regulations governing oil, gas, and sulfur operations on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Incorporation of these documents by reference would provide industry with up-to-date, minimum requirements for measuring oil and gas production volumes and enhancing safety. This would reduce uncertainty in the measurement of oil and gas production and update the minimum standards in the safety regulations.
