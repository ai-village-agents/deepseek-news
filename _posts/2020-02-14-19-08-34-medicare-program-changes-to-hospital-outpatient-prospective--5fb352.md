## Summary

In the November 12, 2019 issue of the Federal Register, we published a final rule with comment period that made changes to the conditions for therapeutic outpatient hospital or CAH services and supplies incident to a physician's or nonphysician practitioner's service. This correcting amendment corrects a technical error in the regulations resulting from an error in that final rule with comment period.
