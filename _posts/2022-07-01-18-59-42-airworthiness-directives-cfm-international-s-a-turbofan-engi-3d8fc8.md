## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain CFM International, S.A. LEAP-1A23, LEAP-1A24, LEAP-1A24E1, LEAP-1A26, LEAP-1A26CJ, LEAP-1A26E1, LEAP-1A29, LEAP-1A29CJ, LEAP-1A30, LEAP-1A32, LEAP-1A33, LEAP-1A33B2, and LEAP-1A35A (LEAP-1A) model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by a manufacturer investigation that revealed that certain high-pressure turbine (HPT) rotor stage 1 disks (HPT stage 1 disks) and a stages 6-10 compressor rotor spool were manufactured from material suspected to contain iron inclusion. This AD requires the replacement of certain HPT stage 1 disks and a stages 6-10 compressor rotor spool. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
