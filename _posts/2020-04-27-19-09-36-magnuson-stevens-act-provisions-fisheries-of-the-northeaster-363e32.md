## Summary

This rule makes allocations of annual catch entitlements to groundfish sectors for the 2020 fishing year and also makes changes to a previously approved regulatory exemption for sectors. The action is necessary because sectors must receive allocations in order to operate. This action is intended to ensure sector allocations are based on the best scientific information available and to help achieve optimum yield for the fishery.
