## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is denying a petition for rulemaking dated September 1, 2016, submitted by Mr. David Lochbaum on behalf of the Union of Concerned Scientists and two co- petitioners (the petitioners). The petition was docketed by the NRC on September 14, 2016, and was assigned Docket No. PRM-50-114. The petitioners requested that the NRC amend its regulations to "promulgate regulations applicable to nuclear power reactors with operating licenses issued by the NRC but in an extended outage." The NRC is denying the petition because the NRC already has regulatory processes in place to address the issues identified in the petition.
