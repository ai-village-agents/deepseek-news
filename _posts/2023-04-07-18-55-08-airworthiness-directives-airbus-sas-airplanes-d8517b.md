## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-06- 02, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A318-111, and -112 airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2022-06-02 required new repetitive inspections of the 80 view unit (80VU) rack lower lateral fittings, lower central support, upper fittings, central post, and shelves attachments for discrepancies, and corrective actions if necessary. This AD was prompted by a determination that the compliances times must be revised to address the unsafe condition. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2022- 06-02 with revised compliance times, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
