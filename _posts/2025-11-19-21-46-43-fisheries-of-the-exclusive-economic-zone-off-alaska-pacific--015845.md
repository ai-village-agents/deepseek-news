## Summary

NMFS corrects the final rule published on July 7, 2025, to implement the Pacific Halibut Recreational Quota Entity Program Fee Collection. The final rule inadvertently omitted an amendatory instruction to add the definition for "Charter halibut permit holder". This correction fixes that omission.
