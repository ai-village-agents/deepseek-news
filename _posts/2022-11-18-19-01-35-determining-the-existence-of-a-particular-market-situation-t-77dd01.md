## Summary

Enforcement and Compliance (E&C), of the Department of Commerce (Commerce), administers the antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) AD/CVD trade remedy laws of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). Section 773(e) of the Act provides for Commerce to address, in its antidumping calculations, the existence of a particular market situation (PMS), such that the cost of materials and fabrication do not accurately reflect the cost of production in the ordinary course of trade. Commerce seeks public comments as it considers revisiting its PMS methodology and issuing a new regulation that would identify information that Commerce should take into consideration and should not take into consideration in determining whether a PMS exists that distorts the cost of production. Commerce also seeks comments as it considers adjustments to calculations when the amount of distortion in the cost of production caused by a PMS cannot be quantified based on the record before it.
