## Summary

At the request of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Secretary of the Interior proposes to extend Public Land Order (PLO) No. 7618, which withdrew public lands from location and entry under the United States mining laws, subject to valid existing rights, to protect the recreational, scenic, cultural, riparian, and fish and wildlife values of the Colorado, Dolores, and Green River Corridors, for an additional 20-year term. Lands included in PLO No. 7618 have been surveyed or resurveyed and corrected. Their official land description has been changed, requiring that the land descriptions be modified and corrected to include lands that were inadvertently not listed in the original PLO. The acreage has been changed from 111,895 acres to 109,287 acres to reflect the updated land description. The land would remain closed to location and entry under the U.S. mining laws. This notice provides a 90-day public comment period and announces that the BLM will host one in-person public meeting in Moab and one virtual meeting regarding this proposal.
