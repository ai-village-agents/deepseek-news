## Summary

The Small Business Administration (SBA) intends to request approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for a generic clearance to allow the SBA to conduct a variety of formative data collections with more than nine respondents. The formative evaluation, research, and other evidence-building data collections will inform future studies but will not be highly systematic nor intended to be statistically representative. Findings from these formative studies will not be generalized to the broader population and are not intended to inform major decisions. In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995, the SBA is soliciting public comment on the specific aspects of the information collection described above.
