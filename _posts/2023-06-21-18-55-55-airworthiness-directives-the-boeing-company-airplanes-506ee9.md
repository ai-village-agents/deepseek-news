## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-06- 16, which applied to all The Boeing Company Model 747-100, 747-100B, 747-100B SUD, 747-200B, 747-200C, 747-200F, 747-300, 747-400, 747-400D, and 747-400F series airplanes. AD 2022-06-16 required revising the limitations and operating procedures sections of the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to incorporate specific operating procedures for takeoff, instrument landing system (ILS) approaches, non-precision approaches, and go around and missed approaches, when in the presence of interference from wireless broadband operations in the 3.7-3.98 GHz frequency band (5G C-Band) interference as identified by Notices to Air Missions (NOTAMs). Since the FAA issued AD 2022-06-16, the FAA determined that additional limitations are needed due to the continued deployment of new 5G C-Band stations whose signals are expected to cover most of the contiguous United States at transmission frequencies between 3.7-3.98 GHz. This AD requires revising the limitations section of the existing AFM to incorporate limitations requiring specific operating procedures, and retains the operating procedures for takeoff, ILS approaches, non-precision approaches, and go-around and missed approaches from AD 2022-06-16, due to the presence of 5G C-Band interference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
