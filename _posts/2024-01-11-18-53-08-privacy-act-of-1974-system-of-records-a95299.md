## Summary

The Peace Corps Office of Inspector General is issuing public notice of its intent to amend a system of records that it maintains subject to the Privacy Act of 1974. PC-19, entitled "Office of Inspector General Investigative Records" is being amended to reflect two new routine uses for information contained in the system and to make various technical corrections and/or clarifications. The amendments also reflect the expanded authority granted to the Peace Corps Inspector General since the initial publication of PC-19.
