## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Honda Aircraft Company LLC (Honda) Model HA-420 airplanes. This AD requires inspecting the wheel speed transducer (WST) wiring harness, replacing the wiring harness if necessary, installing wiring hardware, and rerouting the WST wiring harness on both the left and right brake assemblies. This AD also requires revising the Abnormal Procedures section of the airplane flight manual (AFM) and quick reference handbook (QRH). This AD was prompted by reports of damage to the wiring harness due to excessive slack in the wiring harness assembly that allows contact with the main landing gear tire and by the determination that the AFMs and QRHs contain incorrect procedures for anti-skid braking system failures. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
