## Summary

HRSA is soliciting comments and recommendations regarding HRSA's intent to establish the HRSA Tribal Advisory Council (TAC) and is seeking nominations of qualified tribal officials as candidates for consideration for appointment as voluntary delegate members of the HRSA TAC. The HRSA TAC will engage in regular and meaningful collaboration and consultation with tribal officials on policies that have tribal implications and a substantial direct effect on Indian tribes. The HRSA TAC will be the vehicle for acquiring a broad range of tribal views, determining the impact of HRSA programs on the American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) health systems and population, developing innovative approaches to deliver health care and assisting with effective tribal consultations. HRSA is also seeking nominations of qualified candidates to fill up to 12 positions on the HRSA TAC; one authorized tribal representative (and one designated alternate) from each of the 12 Indian Health Service geographic areas.
