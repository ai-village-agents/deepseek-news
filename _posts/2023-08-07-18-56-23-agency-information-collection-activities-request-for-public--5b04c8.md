## Summary

The National Science Foundation (NSF), on behalf of the National Science and Technology Council's (NSTC) Research Security Subcommittee, has submitted the following information collection to OMB for review and clearance in accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995. This is the second notice for public comment; the first was published in the Federal Register on August 31, 2022, and 100 discrete comments were received. Commenters included individuals, professional societies, institutions of high education, and Federal agencies. All comments have been considered in the development of the proposed version. A summary of the responses to the comments received, including the significant changes and clarifications to the common forms has been incorporated into the Comment Table. Please see http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/. NSF is forwarding the proposed Biographical Sketch and Current and Pending (Other) Support sections of a research application as common disclosure forms to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance simultaneously with the publication of this second notice. The full submission may be found at: http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain. The National Science Foundation has agreed to serve as steward for collection and resolution of public comments, as well as for posting and maintaining these common disclosure forms (including subsequent revisions), as well as other associated documents. The NSTC Research Security Subcommittee, has developed this information collection as common disclosure forms to permit Federal research funding agencies beyond NSF to streamline the information collection process in coordination with OMB.
