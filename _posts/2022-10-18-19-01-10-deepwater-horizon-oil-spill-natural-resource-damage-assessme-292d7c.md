## Summary

In accordance with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), the Final Programmatic Damage Assessment Restoration Plan and Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (Final PDARP/PEIS), and the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) Consent Decree, the Federal and State natural resource trustee agencies for the Alabama Trustee Implementation Group (Alabama TIG) have prepared the Final Bon Secour National Wildlife Refuge Recreation Enhancements: Supplemental Restoration Plan (SRP). The Alabama TIG selects their preferred alternative of adding approximately $2 million to the Mobile Street Boardwalk project budget to facilitate full implementation of the project as originally planned. This would continue the process of restoring lost recreational use in the Alabama Restoration Area that resulted from the DWH oil spill of 2010.
