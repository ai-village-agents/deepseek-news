## Summary

The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Missouri State Office announces its intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for a proposed action involving the segment of the Black River in Butler County, Missouri, that reaches from the city of Poplar Bluff south to the Missouri-Arkansas state line. This reach of the Black River intersects four adjacent watersheds: Little Hunting Slough-Black River, Catherine Slough, Blue Spring Slough, and Old Menorkenut Slough. Along this stretch of river are residences, agricultural land, developed land, and the Coon Island Conservation Area. NRCS is requesting that interested individuals, Federal and State agencies, and Tribes participate in the scoping process for the EIS by attending the initial public scoping meeting and by submitting comments as described below. The goal of scoping is for NRCS to obtain input on identifying significant issues, potential alternatives, information, and analyses relevant to the proposed action.
