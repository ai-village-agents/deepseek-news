## Summary

The United States Department of Agriculture has revised the final rule for the Community Forest and Open Space Program (Community Forest Program). The revisions included in this final rule will allow grant recipients to convey conservation easements to funding entities and, in some circumstances when consistent with the program's purposes, convey community forest land to other eligible entities. The final rule also clarifies the definitions of program-specific terms, streamlines the application process, and implements the Office of Management and Budgets (OMB)'s Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards.
