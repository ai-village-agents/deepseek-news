## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain CFM International, S.A. (CFM) Model LEAP-1B engines. This AD was prompted by a report of multiple aborted takeoffs and air turn- backs (ATBs) caused by high-pressure compressor (HPC) stall, which was induced by high levels of non-synchronous vibration (NSV). A subsequent investigation by the manufacturer revealed that wear on the No. 3 bearing spring finger housing can lead to high levels of NSV. This AD requires repetitive calculations of the oil filter delta pressure (OFDP) data and, depending on the results of the calculation, replacement of the No. 3 bearing spring finger housing. This AD also prohibits installation of an engine with an affected No. 3 bearing spring finger housing onto an airplane that already has one engine with an affected No. 3 bearing spring finger housing installed. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
