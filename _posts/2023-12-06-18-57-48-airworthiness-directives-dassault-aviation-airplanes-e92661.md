## Summary

The FAA is removing Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2010-26-05, which applied to certain Dassault Aviation Model Falcon 10 airplanes; Model FAN JET FALCON, FAN JET FALCON SERIES C, D, E, F, and G airplanes; Model MYSTERE-FALCON 20-C5, 20-D5, 20-E5, and 20-F5 airplanes; and all Model MYSTERE-FALCON 200 airplanes; Model FALCON 2000 and FALCON 2000EX airplanes; Model MYSTERE-FALCON 50 and MYSTERE- FALCON 900 airplanes; and Model FALCON 900EX airplanes. AD 2010-26-05 required repetitive inspections for overpressure tightness on the pressurization control regulating valves and, if necessary, replacing the affected valve with a serviceable unit. The FAA issued AD 2010-26- 05 to address failure of the pressurization control regulating valve (overpressure capsule), which will affect the aircraft's overpressure protection. Since the FAA issued AD 2010-26-05, the FAA issued ADs 2021-04-20, 2020-02-13, 2020-03-24, 2020-03-19, 2020-01-13, 2023-05-15, 2023-04-10, 2023-02-13, 2023-04-18, and 2023-04-13 to address the unsafe condition. Therefore, the FAA has determined that AD 2010-26-05 is no longer necessary. Accordingly, AD 2010-26-05 is removed.
