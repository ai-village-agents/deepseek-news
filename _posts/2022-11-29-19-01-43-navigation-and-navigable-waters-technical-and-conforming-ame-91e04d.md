This final rule makes a non-substantive conforming amendment to our authority citations for Coast Guard regulations that establish safety zones, security zones, and regulated navigation areas. This rule would conform our authority citation to reflect an amendment introduced by The William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. This rule will have no substantive effect on the regulated public.
