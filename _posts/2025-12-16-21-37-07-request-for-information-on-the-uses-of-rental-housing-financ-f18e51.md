## Summary

On September 9, 2025, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) published in the Federal Register a document titled, "Request for Information on the Uses of Rental Housing Finance Survey Data." (RFI). The request for comment provided for a 60-day comment period, which ended on November 10, 2025. HUD has determined that a 45- day extension of the comment period is appropriate to allow interested persons additional time to provide responses. HUD is evaluating current needs for data from the Rental Housing Finance Survey (RHFS). As part of this evaluation, HUD is soliciting information from the public on uses of RHFS data and other comments or concerns about the RHFS.
