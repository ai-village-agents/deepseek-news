## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering an exemption request from Holtec Decommissioning International, LLC (HDI) for the Indian Point Energy Center Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation. This exemption would, if granted, allow HDI to load up to three MPC-32Ms, using Amendment No. 15 for Certificate of Compliance (CoC) No. 1014 for the HI-STORM 100 storage system, with either up to thirty-two fuel assemblies having either Californium (Cf-252) or Antimony-Beryllium (Sb-Be) neutron source assemblies (NSAs) with sufficient cooling time, or a combination of up to five fuel assemblies having primary Plutonium Beryllium (Pu-Be) NSAs and the remaining basket locations with fuel assemblies having either Cf-252 or Sb-Be NSAs with sufficient cooling time. As discussed further, the proposed exemption would permit HDI to load the fuel assemblies having either Cf-252 or Sb-Be NSAs in any location in the basket and the fuel assemblies having Pu-Be NSAs such that one is located in the center of the basket and one is located in each of the four basket quadrants. The NRC prepared an environmental assessment (EA) and concluded that the proposed action would have no significant environmental impact. Accordingly, the NRC staff is issuing a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) associated with the proposed exemption.
