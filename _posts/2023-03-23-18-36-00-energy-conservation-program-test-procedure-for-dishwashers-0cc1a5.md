## Summary

In this notice of proposed rulemaking ("NOPR"), the U.S Department of Energy ("DOE") proposes to add clarifying instructions regarding the detergent reporting requirements and an enforcement provision for dishwashers to specify the detergent and dosing method that DOE would use for any enforcement testing of dishwasher models certified in accordance with the currently applicable dishwasher test procedure prior to July 17, 2023 (i.e., the date by which the dishwasher test procedure as amended by a final rule published on January 18, 2023, will be mandatory for product testing). DOE is also proposing to add within the amended test procedure clarifying instructions regarding the allowable dosing options for each type of detergent. DOE is seeking comment from interested parties on this NOPR.
