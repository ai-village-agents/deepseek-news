## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission" or "SEC") is proposing to amend existing requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") to update the disclosure required for order executions in national market system ("NMS") stocks. First, the Commission is proposing to expand the scope of reporting entities subject to the rule that requires market centers to make available to the public monthly execution quality reports to encompass broker-dealers with a larger number of customers. Next, the Commission is proposing to modify the definition of "covered order" to include certain orders submitted outside of regular trading hours and certain orders submitted with stop prices. In addition, the Commission is proposing modifications to the information required to be reported under the rule, including changing how orders are categorized by order size as well as how they are categorized by order type. As part of the changes to these categories, the Commission is proposing to capture execution quality information for fractional share orders, odd- lot orders, and larger-sized orders. Additionally, the Commission is proposing to modify reporting requirements for non-marketable limit orders ("NMLOs") in order to capture more relevant execution quality information for these orders by requiring statistics to be reported from the time such orders become executable. The Commission is also proposing to eliminate time-to-execution categories in favor of average time to execution, median time to execution, and 99th percentile time to execution, each as measured in increments of a millisecond or finer and calculated on a share-weighted basis. In order to better reflect the speed of the marketplace, the Commission is proposing that the time of order receipt and time of order execution be measured in increments of a millisecond or finer, and that realized spread be calculated at both 15 seconds and one minute. Finally, the Commission is proposing to enhance the accessibility of the required reports by requiring all reporting entities to make a summary report available.
