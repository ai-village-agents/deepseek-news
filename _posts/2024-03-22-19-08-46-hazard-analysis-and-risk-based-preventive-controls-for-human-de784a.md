## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, we, or the Agency) is extending the comment period for two chapters of a multichapter draft guidance entitled "Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food: Draft Guidance for Industry," which were announced in the Federal Register of September 27, 2023. The relevant draft chapters are entitled "Chapter 11-- Food Allergen Program" and "Chapter 16--Acidified Foods." We are taking this action in response to a request for an extension to allow interested persons additional time to submit comments before FDA begins work on the final guidance.
