## Summary

In this document, the Media Bureau of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) released an Order that re-codifies language that was inadvertently eliminated from the Commission's rules relating to information that must be provided by Next Gen TV broadcast stations in "non-expedited" applications for ATSC 3.0 service. This Order does not change any regulatory obligations.
