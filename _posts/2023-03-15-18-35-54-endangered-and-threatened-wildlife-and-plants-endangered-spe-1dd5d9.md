## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), determine endangered status under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended, for the bog buck moth (Hemileuca maia menyanthevora) (=H. iroquois), a moth that occurs in Oswego County, New York, and Ontario, Canada. This rule adds the bog buck moth to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and applies the protections of the Act to this species. We have determined that designation of critical habitat for the bog buck moth is not prudent at this time.
