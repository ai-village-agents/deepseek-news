## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited Model DHC-8-400 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that electrical bonding jumpers had been installed on fuel scavenge lines even after the removal was required by previous AD rulemaking and that electrical bonding jumpers may have been installed in production or in service at other locations. This AD requires an inspection for electrical bonding jumpers and brackets on the fuel scavenge and vent lines at specific wing locations, and if installed, removal or modification of those jumpers and brackets. This AD also requires a records check to determine if certain maintenance tasks were performed and removal, modification, or rework if those tasks were performed. This AD also prohibits the use of earlier versions of certain maintenance tasks. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
