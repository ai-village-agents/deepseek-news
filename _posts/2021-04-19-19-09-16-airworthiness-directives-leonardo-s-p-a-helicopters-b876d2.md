## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Leonardo S.p.a. Model AW189 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by the identification of misleading information in the emergency procedure for the "1(2) FUEL LOW" caution message. This proposed AD would require revising the existing Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) for your helicopter. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
