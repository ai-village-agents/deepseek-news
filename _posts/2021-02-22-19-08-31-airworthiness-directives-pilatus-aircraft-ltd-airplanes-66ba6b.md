## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Pilatus Aircraft Ltd. Model PC-7 airplanes. This AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. This AD requires revising the Airworthiness Limitations section (ALS) of the existing aircraft maintenance manual (AMM) to introduce new mandatory repetitive inspections for the flap pivot arm assemblies and for certain wing angle brackets, and to implement a change to the Oxygen cylinder and pressure reducer task item. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
