## Summary

On November 16, 2020, FHWA published an interim final rule (IFR) amending FHWA's regulations to allow States the ability to use the Indefinite Delivery and Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) method of contracting, including job order contracting (JOC), on Federal-aid highway projects, under certain circumstances, on a permanent basis. This action adopts the IFR with a few minor changes and technical amendments. Most provisions from the IFR remain unchanged. This action also restores a missing provision inadvertently removed during an earlier, unrelated rulemaking.
