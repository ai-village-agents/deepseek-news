## Summary

The Commission hereby gives notice of the scheduling of the final phase of countervailing duty investigation No. 701-TA-759 (Final) pursuant to the Tariff Act of 1930 to determine whether an industry in the United States is materially injured or threatened with material injury, or the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded, by reason of imports of multifunctional acrylate and methacrylate monomers and oligomers ("MAMMOs") from Taiwan, provided for in subheadings 2916.12.5050, 2916.14.2050, 3824.99.2900, 3907.29.0000 and 3907.30.0000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, preliminarily determined by the Department of Commerce ("Commerce") to be subsidized.
