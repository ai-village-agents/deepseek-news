## Summary

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is seeking comment on a proposal that would amend signage requirements for insured depository institutions' (IDIs) digital deposit-taking channels and automated teller machines (ATMs) and like devices. The proposed changes are intended to address implementation issues and sources of potential confusion that have arisen following the adoption of current signage requirements for these banking channels. The proposal would provide additional flexibility to IDIs while also enabling consumers to better understand when they are conducting business with an IDI and when their funds are protected by the FDIC's deposit insurance coverage.
