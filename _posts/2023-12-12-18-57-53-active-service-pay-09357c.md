## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) amends its adjudication regulations to permit VA to adjust disability compensation payments under certain circumstances upon receipt of notice from the Department of Defense (DoD) that the veteran has received or is receiving active service pay. The effect of this action is to reduce overpayments and erroneous payments associated with receipt of VA disability compensation and DoD active service pay by allowing VA to make necessary adjustments as close in time to the receipt of active service pay as possible. Additionally, the amendments will allow VA to resume payments discontinued due to receipt of active service pay based on information received from DoD. The amendments will also clarify how VA adjudicates benefit adjustments based on a veteran's receipt of active service pay for certain types of service.
