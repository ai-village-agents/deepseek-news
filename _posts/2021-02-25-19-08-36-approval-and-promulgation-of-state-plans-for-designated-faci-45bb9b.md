## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to New York's section 111(d) state plan (the "State Plan") for Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) landfills, pursuant to the Clean Air Act ("CAA" or the "Act"). The proposed State Plan revision consists of amendments to New York's "Landfill Gas Collection and Control Systems for Certain Municipal Solid Waste Landfills," as well as attendant revisions to "General Provisions." The primary goal of this regulation is to implement and enforce the Emission Guidelines (EG) promulgated by the EPA for MSW landfills on August 29, 2016. The goal of the revised federal EG is to reduce emissions of landfill gas containing Non-methane Organic Compounds (NMOC) and methane by lowering the emissions threshold at which an existing MSW landfill must install and operate a Gas Collection and Control System (GCCS). The emission threshold reduction will address air emissions from all affected MSW landfills, including NMOC and methane. The reduction of emissions will improve air quality and protect the public health from exposure to landfill gas emissions.
