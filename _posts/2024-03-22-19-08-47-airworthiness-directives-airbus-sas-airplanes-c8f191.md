## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-14-10, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2022-14-10 requires repetitive inspections for cracking of the radius of the front spar vertical stringers and the horizontal floor beam on a certain frame (FR), repetitive inspections for cracking of the fastener holes of the front spar vertical stringers on that frame, and repair if necessary. AD 2022-14-10 provides, for certain airplanes, a modification of the center wing box area that terminates the repetitive inspections under certain conditions. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-14-10, an additional airplane model has been identified that is also subject to the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2022-14-10 and would add Model A321-271N airplanes to the applicability, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
