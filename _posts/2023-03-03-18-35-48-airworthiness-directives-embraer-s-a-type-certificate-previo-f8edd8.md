## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Embraer S.A. Model ERJ 190-300 airplanes. This AD was prompted by failed lockwires on the attachment of the left-hand main landing gear (MLG) trunnion bearing to spar 2. This AD requires inspecting for damage of the left- and right-hand MLG trunnion bearing attaching parts, replacing damaged parts, and modifying the MLG trunnion bearing attaching parts, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
