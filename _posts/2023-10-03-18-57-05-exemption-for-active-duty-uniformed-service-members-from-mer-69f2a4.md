## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to exempt certain members of the uniformed services from Merchant Mariner Credential (MMC) fees for the evaluation of an MMC application, the administration of an examination required for an MMC endorsement, and the issuance of an MMC. This proposal is in response to Executive Order 13860, "Supporting the Transition of Active-Duty Service Members and Military Veterans Into the Merchant Marine," and section 3511 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020. Under this proposal, members of the uniformed services would be exempt from paying fees for an MMC.
