## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A330-200, -200 Freighter, -300, -800, and -900 series airplanes; Model A340-200 and -300 series airplanes; and Model A340-541 and A340-642 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that an erroneous torque value for the attachment nuts to install a pitot probe was included in the affected Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) task. This AD requires re-torqueing the attachment nuts of each affected part. In addition, this AD prohibits the use of the affected AMM task, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
