## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Vulcanair S.p.A. Model P.68, P.68B, P.68C, P.68C-TC, P.68 "Observer," P.68TC "Observer," P.68 "Observer 2," and P.68R airplanes. This AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as corrosion causing failure of the upper rudder hinge. This AD requires repetitively inspecting the upper and lower rudder hinges for corrosion, cracking, and damage, and depending on the inspection results, taking corrective action. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
