## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to modify and reissue the current DHS system of records titled "Department of Homeland Security/U.S. Customs and Border Protection-002 Global Enrollment System," and rename it as "Department of Homeland Security/U.S. Customs and Border Protection- 002 Trusted and Registered Traveler Programs." This system of records allows the Department of Homeland Security/U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to collect and maintain records on individuals who voluntarily provide personally identifiable information to CBP in return for enrollment in a program that will make them eligible for dedicated CBP processing at designated U.S. border ports of entry, including all trusted traveler and registered traveler programs.
