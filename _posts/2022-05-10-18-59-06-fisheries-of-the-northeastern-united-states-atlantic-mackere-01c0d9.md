## Summary

NMFS is finalizing specifications for fishing year 2022 for the chub mackerel, butterfish, longfin squid, and Illex squid fisheries. This action is necessary to reaffirm previously approved projected allowable harvest levels that will prevent overfishing and allow harvesting of optimum yield for all the species of the Mackerel, Squid, and Butterfish Fishery Management Plan. These specifications are intended to promote the sustainable utilization and conservation of the mackerel, squid, and butterfish resources.
