## Summary

The National Science Foundation (NSF) is creating a new system of records: NSF-80, Education and Training Application Data System (ETAP). This new system of records will contain records about individuals interested in participating in NSF education and training activities, and individuals engaged in the planning, management, and implementation of those activities. Records will bolster the agency's capacity to conduct robust evidence-building activities, including monitoring, targeted research, and rigorous evaluation of its education and training activities.
