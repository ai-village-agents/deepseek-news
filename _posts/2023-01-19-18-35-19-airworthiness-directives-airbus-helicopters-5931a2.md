## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model EC120B, EC130B4, and EC130T2 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of corrosion detected on certain part-numbered landing gear assemblies. This proposed AD would require, for helicopters with certain part-numbered landing gear assemblies installed, visually inspecting for cracks and corrosion; borescope inspecting; and if required, removing corrosion, measuring thickness, interpreting results of the measurements, applying chemical conversion coating and primer, and removing affected parts (landing gear assembly) and affected part sub-assemblies (front or rear crossbeam or left-hand or right-hand skid assembly) from service and replacing with airworthy parts. This proposed AD would allow an affected part or affected part sub-assembly to be installed on a helicopter if certain actions in this proposed AD are accomplished. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
