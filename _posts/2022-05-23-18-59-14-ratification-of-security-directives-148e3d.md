## Summary

DHS is publishing official notice that the Transportation Security Oversight Board (TSOB) has ratified Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Security Directive 1580-21-01, Security Directive 1582-21-01, Security Directive Pipeline-2021-01A, and Security Directive Pipeline-2021-02B. Security Directive 1580-21-01 requires owners/operators of specified freight railroad carriers to implement certain measures addressing cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Security Directive 1582-21-01 applies these same requirements to owner/operators of specified passenger railroad carriers and rail transit systems. Security Directive Pipeline-2021-01A and Security Directive Pipeline- 2021-02B amend earlier cybersecurity directives applicable to owner/ operators of critical pipeline systems and facilities. Security Directive Pipeline-2021-01A incorporates a revised definition of a "cybersecurity incident" and aligns the definition with the definition applicable across other modes of transportation regulated by TSA. Security Directive Pipeline-2021-02B provides additional flexibility to owner/operators in complying with the mitigation measures required by Security Directive Pipeline-2021-02.
