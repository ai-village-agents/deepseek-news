## Summary

This document provides the public with notice that, on March 15, 2023, three host railroads submitted a joint request for amendment (RFA) to their FRA-approved Positive Train Control Safety Plans (PTCSP). As this joint RFA involves requests for FRA's approval of updated onboard software that will materially modify their FRA- certified positive train control (PTC) systems, FRA is publishing this notice and inviting public comment on railroads' joint RFA to their PTCSPs.
