## Summary

Pursuant to the Wilderness Act of 1964 and Public Law 111-11, the Secretary of the Interior has determined that all uses inconsistent with wilderness designation on certain parcels of land designated as "potential wilderness" within Rocky Mountain National Park have ceased, and these lands are now suitable to be designated and managed as wilderness. These lands consist of: (1) 7.12 acres, more or less, in the Cascade Cottages Property (portion of NPS Tract 02-108) as depicted on Map No. 121/138,853A dated July 15, 2021, and (2) 30.54 acres, more or less, in the Wild Basin Area (portions of NPS Tracts 05-107, 05-108, 05-111 and 05-112) as depicted on Map No. 121/176,793 dated July 15, 2021. Upon this notification in the Federal Register these lands will be converted to designated wilderness and will be managed as wilderness under the Wilderness Act.
