# Use of Electronic Identification Eartags as Official Identification in Cattle and Bison

## Summary

We are proposing to amend the animal disease traceability regulations to require that eartags applied on or after a date 6 months (180 days) after publication in the Federal Register of a final rule following this proposed rule be both visually and electronically readable in order to be recognized for use as official eartags for interstate movement of cattle and bison covered under the regulations. We are also proposing to clarify certain record retention and record access requirements and revise some requirements pertaining to slaughter cattle. These proposed changes would enhance the ability of Tribal, State and Federal officials, private veterinarians, and livestock producers to quickly respond to high-impact diseases currently existing in the United States, as well as foreign animal diseases that threaten the viability of the U.S. cattle and bison industries.
