## Summary

CCC is correcting an interim rule that was published in the Federal Register on February 13, 2020, to incorporate the 2018 Farm Bill changes to the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP) program administration. There was an unintentional error that omitted several paragraphs in a certain section in the RCPP rule. CCC and NRCS are also extending the comment period for the interim rule.
