Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on July 12, 2023, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of Vicor Corporation of Andover, Massachusetts. A supplement to the complaint was filed on July 27, 2023. The complaint, as supplemented, alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain power converter modules and computing systems containing the same by reason of the infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 9,166,481 ("the '481 patent"), U.S. Patent No. 9,516,761 ("the '761 patent"), and U.S. Patent No. 10,199,950 ("the '950 patent").
