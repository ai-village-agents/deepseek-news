## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the DoD is modifying the system of records entitled, AFNConnect (AFNC) and AFN Now, DPA 02. The American Forces Network (AFN) services consists of two web-based automated information systems. The systems are used to document the eligibility and continued validation of authorized individuals who register an AFN-capable satellite decoder and/or access AFN Over the Top (OTT) Live Streaming and Video on Demand (VOD) Services via the AFNC and AFN Now applications. The AFN provides U.S. military commanders worldwide with a means to communicate internal information to DoD and other Federal agency audiences stationed outside of the United States, its territories or possessions. Records may also be used as a management tool for statistical analysis, tracking, reporting, and evaluating program effectiveness.
