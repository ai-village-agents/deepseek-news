## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bell Textron, Inc. (Type Certificate previously held by Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc.) (Bell) Model 204B, 205A, 205A-1, 205B, 212, 214B, 214B-1, 412, 412CF, and 412EP helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a shoulder harness seat belt comfort clip (comfort clip) interfering with the seat belt inertia reel. This proposed AD would require removing comfort clips from service and inspecting the seat belt shoulder harness (harness) for a rip or an abrasion. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
