## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to renew an information collection. The collection involves manufacturers of small unmanned aircraft providing a safety statement to owners of the UAS they produce. This is a statutory requirement. To minimize the burden on small businesses, the FAA has developed an example safety statement that can be used to satisfy the requirement.
