## Summary

This order partially revokes 15 Public Land Orders (PLOs) insofar as they affect approximately 27,142,677 acres of public lands reserved for study and classification, as appropriate, by the Department of the Interior. This order opens these lands specifically to allow for allotment selection by eligible Alaska Native Vietnam-era Veterans under the Alaska Native Vietnam-era Veterans Land Allotment Program (Allotment Program) established by the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act of 2019 (Dingell Act). This partial revocation and opening was analyzed in the Alaska Native Vietnam-era Veterans Land Allotment Program Environmental Assessment (EA) and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) signed on April 21, 2022.
