## Summary

The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and Kitsap County Public Transportation Benefit Area Authority (Kitsap Transit), the operator of Kitsap Fast Ferries, issue this early scoping notice to advise tribes, agencies, and the public that FTA and Kitsap Transit will explore potential expansion of passenger-only ferry facility capacity on the downtown Seattle waterfront for the Kitsap Transit Seattle Fast Ferry Terminal Facility Project (Project). The Project would improve regional transit service by addressing the current lack of passenger-only ferry landing site capacity on the Seattle waterfront, the most in-demand destination in downtown Seattle.
