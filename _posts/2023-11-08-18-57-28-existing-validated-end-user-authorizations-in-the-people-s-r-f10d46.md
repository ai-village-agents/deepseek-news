# Existing Validated End-User Authorizations in the People's Republic of China: Samsung China Semiconductor Co. Ltd. and SK hynix Semiconductor (China)) Ltd; Correction

## Summary

The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) published a rule in the Federal Register on October 17, 2023, that amended the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to revise the existing Validated End- User (VEU) list for the People's Republic of China (PRC) for Samsung China Semiconductor Co. Ltd. and SK hynix Semiconductor (China) Ltd. That rule inadvertently omitted two amendments to the list of VEUs, which resulted in failure to add a word to the description of eligible items for SK Hynix Semiconductor (China) Ltd.; as well as the failure to remove the entry for SK hynix Semiconductor (Wuxi), which was necessary because SK hynix Semiconductor (Wuxi) recently merged with SK hynix Semiconductor (China) Ltd. This rule corrects both omissions.
