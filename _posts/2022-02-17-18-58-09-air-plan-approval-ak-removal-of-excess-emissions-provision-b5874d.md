## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Alaska, through the Alaska Department of Environment Conservation, on January 9, 2017. The revision was submitted by Alaska in response to a finding of substantial inadequacy and SIP call published on June 12, 2015, for a provision in the Alaska SIP related to excess emissions during startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) events. EPA is approving the SIP revision and finds that such SIP revision corrects the deficiency identified in the June 12, 2015, SIP call.
