## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Helicopters Model AS350B, AS350BA, AS350B1, AS350B2, AS350D, AS355E, AS355F, AS355F1, AS355F2, and AS355N helicopters. This AD was prompted by two reports of debonding of the tail rotor (T/R) blade leading edge protection shields. This AD requires repetitively inspecting certain T/R blades and depending on the inspection results, replacing the T/R blade, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference (IBR). This AD also prohibits installing certain T/R blades. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
