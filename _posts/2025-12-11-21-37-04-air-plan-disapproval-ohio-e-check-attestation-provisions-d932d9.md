## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to disapprove a revision to the Ohio State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted on July 9, 2025, by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio EPA). The revision, which Ohio EPA submitted pursuant to Ohio Amended Substitute House Bill 54 ("E-Check Ease Act"), includes provisions that would create an alternative to state-run mandatory on- board diagnostic (OBD) inspections with a self-attestation program that allows motorists to self-attest that their vehicles comply with emissions requirements. This approach is inconsistent with statutory and regulatory requirements for Enhanced inspection and maintenance (I/ M) programs under the Clean Air Act (CAA) and would interfere with attainment and reasonable further progress toward the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).
