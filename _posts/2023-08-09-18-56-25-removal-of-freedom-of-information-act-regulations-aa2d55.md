## Summary

This rule rescinds the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities' (the "Foundation") regulations implementing the Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA"). These regulations are obsolete because each of the Foundation's constituent agencies--the National Endowment for the Arts ("NEA"), the National Endowment for the Humanities ("NEH"), the Institute of Museum and Library Services ("IMLS"), and the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities ("FCAH")--either have adopted their own, agency-specific regulations, or are not required to implement Freedom of Information Act regulations.
