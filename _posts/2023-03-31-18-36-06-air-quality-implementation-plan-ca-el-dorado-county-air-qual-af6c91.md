## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the El Dorado County Air Quality Management District (EDCAQMD) portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). In this action, we are proposing to approve a rule submitted by the EDCAQMD governing the issuance of permits for stationary sources, focusing on the preconstruction review and permitting of major sources and major modifications under part D of title I of the Clean Air Act (CAA or "the Act"). We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
