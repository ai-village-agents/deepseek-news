# Unlicensed Use of the 6 GHz Band; Expanding Flexible Use in Mid-Band Spectrum Between 3.7 and 24 GHz

## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission or FCC) expands unlicensed very low power (VLP) device operation to the entire 6 gigahertz (GHz) band (5.925-7.125 megahertz (MHz)). The VLP devices will operate with the same power levels and other technical and operational requirements that apply to VLP devices in the U-NII-5 (5.925-6.425 MHz) and U-NII-7(6.525-6.875 MHz) portions of the 6 GHz band. These technical and operational requirements are designed to prevent the licensed services that operate in the 6 GHz band from experiencing harmful interference. The Commission's actions will provide additional spectrum for high-throughput, low latency operations for these versatile portable devices.
