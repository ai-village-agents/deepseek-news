# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Airbus Helicopters Model SA-365C1, SA-365C2, and SA-365N helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of damaged control rod dual bearings (dual bearings) that are installed on the tail rotor gearbox (TGB). This proposed AD would require repetitively inspecting the TGB magnetic plug for particles, analyzing any particles collected, taking corrective actions if necessary, and reporting certain information. Finally, this proposed AD would allow an affected dual bearing to be installed on a helicopter if certain actions are accomplished, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
