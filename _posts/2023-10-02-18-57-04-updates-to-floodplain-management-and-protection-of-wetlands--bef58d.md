## Summary

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) proposes to amend its regulations to implement the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard (FFRMS) and update the agency's 8-step decision-making process floodplain reviews. FEMA also proposes a supplementary policy that would further clarify how FEMA would apply the FFRMS. The proposed rule would change how FEMA defines a floodplain with respect to certain actions, and FEMA would use natural systems, ecosystem process, and nature-based approaches, where possible, when developing alternatives to locating the proposed action in the floodplain.
