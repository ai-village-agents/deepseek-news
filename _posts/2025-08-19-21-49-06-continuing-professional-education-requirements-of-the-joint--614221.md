## Summary

This document sets forth final regulations that amend the continuing professional education requirements for actuaries enrolled by the Joint Board for the Enrollment of Actuaries (Joint Board). These final regulations remove the physical presence requirement for formal continuing professional education programs required for active enrolled actuaries and the physical location requirement from course certifications. These final regulations also modify the continuing professional education requirement for certain actuaries who seek to return to active enrollment from inactive status due to their failure to timely satisfy the renewal requirements in the first enrollment cycle after their initial enrollment. Finally, the final regulations add a requirement that certificates of instruction for continuing professional education courses must reflect the hours credited toward the formal program requirement. These final regulations solely address the enrollment and renewal rules of the Joint Board applicable to enrolled actuaries and do not affect pension plans, plan participants, or the general public.
