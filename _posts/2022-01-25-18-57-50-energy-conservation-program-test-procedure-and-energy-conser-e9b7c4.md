## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is initiating rulemaking activities to consider potential test procedure and energy conservation standards for consumer air cleaners. Through this request for information ("RFI"), DOE seeks data and information regarding development and evaluation of a new test procedure that would be reasonably designed to produce test results which reflect energy use during a representative average use cycle for the product without being unduly burdensome to conduct. Additionally, this RFI solicits information regarding the development and evaluation of potential new energy conservation standards for consumer air cleaners, and whether such standards would result in significant energy savings, be technologically feasible and economically justified. DOE also welcomes written comments from the public on any subject within the scope of this document (including those topics not specifically raised), as well as the submission of data and other relevant information.
