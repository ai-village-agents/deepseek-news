## Summary

NMFS announces the availability of the "Draft Supplemental Programmatic Environmental Assessment (SPEA) for Fisheries Research Conducted and Funded by the Northwest Fisheries Science Center." Publication of this notice begins the official public comment period for this SPEA. The purpose of this Draft SPEA is to evaluate potential direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of changes in research that were not analyzed in the 2018 Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) Programmatic Environmental Assessment (PEA), or new research activities along the U.S. West Coast, from California US-Mexico Border to Washington US-Canada Border. Select surveys in partnership with Department of Fisheries and Oceans-Canada extend this research area through British Columbia, Canada to Alaska. Where necessary, updates to certain information on species, stock status or other components of the affected environment that may result in different conclusions from the 2018 PEA are presented in this analysis.
