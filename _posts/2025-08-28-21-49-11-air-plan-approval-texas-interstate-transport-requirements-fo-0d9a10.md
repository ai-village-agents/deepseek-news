## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving the portion of the State Implementation Plan (SIP) submittal from the State of Texas demonstrating that the State satisfies the interstate transport requirements of section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I), also known as the "good neighbor" provision of the CAA, for the 2010 1-hour sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) primary National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). The good neighbor provision requires each State's implementation plan to contain adequate provisions prohibiting the interstate transport of air pollution in amounts that will contribute significantly to nonattainment, or interfere with maintenance, of a NAAQS in any other State.
