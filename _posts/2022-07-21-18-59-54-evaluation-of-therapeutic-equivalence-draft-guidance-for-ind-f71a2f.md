## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled "Evaluation of Therapeutic Equivalence." The draft guidance would explain FDA's therapeutic equivalence evaluations, including the assignment of therapeutic equivalence codes, if finalized as written. FDA's therapeutic equivalence evaluations are listed for multisource prescription drug products approved under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) in the active section of the Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (commonly known as the Orange Book). These therapeutic equivalence evaluations have been prepared to serve as public information and advice to state health agencies, prescribers, and pharmacists to promote public education in the area of drug product selection and to foster containment of health care costs.
