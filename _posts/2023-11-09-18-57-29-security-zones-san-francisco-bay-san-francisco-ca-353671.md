## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing two temporary security zones in the navigable waters of the San Francisco Bay, San Francisco, CA within the San Francisco Captain of the Port (COTP) zone. The security zones are along U.S. Highway 101 North from Oyster Point to Candlestick Point, and San Francisco Pier 27/29, approximately 200 yards from shore. The security zones are necessary to protect the harbors, ports, and waterfront facilities during a visit from high-ranking government officials and members of their official party. Entry of vessels or persons into these zones is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port San Francisco or a designated representative.
