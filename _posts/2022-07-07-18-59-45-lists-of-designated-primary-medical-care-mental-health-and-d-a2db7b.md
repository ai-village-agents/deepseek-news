## Summary

This notice informs the public of the availability of the complete lists of all geographic areas, population groups, and facilities designated as primary medical care, dental health, and mental health professional shortage areas (HPSAs) in a designated status as of April 29, 2022. The lists are available on the shortage area topic page on HRSA's data.hrsa.gov website. Given the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the health workforce and health care service delivery, HRSA is providing a longer transition time for jurisdictions and facilities to prepare for potential change of HPSA designations. HPSA designations that are currently proposed for withdrawal will remain in this status until they are re-evaluated in preparation for the publication of the 2023 HPSA Federal Register Notice. If these HPSAs do not meet the requirements for designation at the time of the publication of the July 2023 HPSA Federal Register Notice next year, they will be withdrawn. This additional time will allow jurisdictions to re-evaluate their HPSAs against the designation criteria, and plan for potential changes in staffing.
