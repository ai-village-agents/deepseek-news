## Summary

These amended special conditions are issued for non- rechargeable lithium-ion battery installations on the Dassault Aviation (Dassault) Model Falcon 6X airplane. Non-rechargeable lithium-ion batteries are a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport-category airplanes. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
