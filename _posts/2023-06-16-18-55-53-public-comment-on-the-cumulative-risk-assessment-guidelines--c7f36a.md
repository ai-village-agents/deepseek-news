## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing a 60-day public comment period on the draft Cumulative Risk Assessment (CRA) Guidelines for Planning and Problem Formulation. The CRA Guidelines for Planning and Problem Formulation describe steps for the planning and problem formulation of CRAs and offer guidelines for when cumulative risk assessments could be appropriate. Planning defines both the process for conducting the risk assessment and its general scope, while problem formulation identifies major factors considered in a specific assessment to inform its technical approach. The draft CRA Guidelines for Planning and Problem Formulation are not final, and do not represent, and should not be construed to represent, Agency policy or views.
