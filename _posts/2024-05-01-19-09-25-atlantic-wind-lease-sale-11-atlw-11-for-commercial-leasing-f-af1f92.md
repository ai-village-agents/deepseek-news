## Summary

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) proposes to hold Atlantic Wind Lease Sale 11 (ATLW-11) and offer multiple lease areas (Lease Areas) for commercial wind power development on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) in the Gulf of Maine. The proposed Lease Areas are located in the Gulf of Maine offshore the States of Maine and New Hampshire, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This Proposed Sale Notice (PSN) contains information pertaining to the proposed Lease Areas, certain lease provisions and conditions, auction details, lease forms, criteria for evaluating competing bids, award procedures, appeal procedures, and lease execution procedures. The issuance of any lease resulting from a sale would not constitute approval of project-specific plans to develop floating offshore wind energy. Such plans, if submitted by the Lessee, would be subject to subsequent environmental, technical, and public reviews prior to a BOEM decision whether to approve them. BOEM is proposing an ascending clock auction with multiple-factor bidding.
