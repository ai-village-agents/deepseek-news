## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is correcting a final rule that appeared in the Federal Register on July 12, 2023. The final rule determined the applicable volume requirements and percentage standards for the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) for 2023 through 2025 for cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel, established the second supplemental standard addressing the judicial remand of the 2016 standard-setting rulemaking, and made several regulatory changes to the RFS program. This document corrects several amendatory instructions in the regulatory text in the final rule, but does not make any substantive changes.
