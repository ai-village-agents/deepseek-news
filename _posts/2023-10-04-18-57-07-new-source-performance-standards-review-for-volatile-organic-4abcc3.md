## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing amendments to the Standards of Performance for Volatile Organic Liquid Storage Vessels (Including Petroleum Liquid Storage Vessels) as the preliminary results of the review of the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) required by the Clean Air Act. The EPA is proposing revisions to the NSPS that are applicable to volatile organic liquid (VOL) storage vessels that commence construction, reconstruction, or modification after October 4, 2023 under a new NSPS subpart. In the new NSPS subpart, the EPA is proposing to reduce the vapor pressure applicability thresholds In addition, the EPA is proposing to revise the volatile organic compound (VOC) standards to reflect the best system of emissions reductions (BSER) for affected storage vessels. We are also proposing additional monitoring and operating requirements to ensure continuous compliance with the standard. In addition, the EPA is proposing degassing emission controls; clarification of startup, shutdown, and malfunction requirements; requirements for electronic reporting; and other technical improvements. The EPA is also proposing to amend NSPS subpart Kb to apply to VOL storage vessels that commence construction, reconstruction or modification after July 23, 1984 and on or before October 4, 2023 and to add electronic reporting requirements.
