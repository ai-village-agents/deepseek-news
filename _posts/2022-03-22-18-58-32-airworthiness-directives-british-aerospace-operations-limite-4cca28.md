# Airworthiness Directives; British Aerospace (Operations) Limited and British Aerospace Regional Aircraft Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all British Aerospace (Operations) Limited Model Jetstream Model 3101 and British Aerospace Regional Aircraft Model Jetstream Model 3201 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as stress corrosion cracking of the primary flight control cable terminals. This proposed AD would require repetitively inspecting the turnbuckle type control cable terminals in the rudder and elevator primary flight control circuits for corrosion, pitting, and cracking and, depending on the inspection results, replacing an affected cable assembly. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
