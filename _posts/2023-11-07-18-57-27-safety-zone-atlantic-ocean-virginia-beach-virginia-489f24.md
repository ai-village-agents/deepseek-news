## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for navigable waters within a 550-yard radius of the M/V HOS MYSTIQUE and accompanying machinery while the vessel is conducting a subsea survey for potential unexploded ordinance (pUXO) in the Atlantic Ocean within three nautical miles of the shores of the State Military Reservation, Virginia Beach. The safety zone is needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards created by the subsea survey operations. Entry of vessels or persons into this zone is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port, Sector Virgina or designated representative.
