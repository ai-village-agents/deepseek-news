## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain MHI RJ Aviation ULC Model CL-600-2C10 (Regional Jet Series 700, 701 & 702), CL-600-2C11 (Regional Jet Series 550), and CL-600-2D24 (Regional Jet Series 900) airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that some piccolo ducts for the wing anti-ice system have bleed holes that do not conform to requirements. This AD requires, depending on airplane configuration, inspection for the presence of affected wing anti-ice system piccolo ducts and corrective actions, or replacement of affected piccolo ducts with new piccolo ducts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
