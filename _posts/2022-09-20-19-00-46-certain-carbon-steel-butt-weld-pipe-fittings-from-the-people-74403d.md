## Summary

On September 8, 2022, the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) issued its final judgment in Vandewater International, Inc. v. United States, Court No. 18-00199, sustaining the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce)'s remand redetermination pertaining to the scope ruling for the antidumping duty order on carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from the People's Republic of China finding steel branch outlets imported by Vandewater International Inc. (Vandewater) to be covered by the order. Commerce is notifying the public that the CIT's final judgment is not in harmony with Commerce's scope ruling, and that Commerce is amending the scope ruling to clarify that a different effective date for suspension of liquidation now applies.
