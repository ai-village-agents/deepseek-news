## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bell Textron Inc., Model 212, 412, 412CF, and 412EP helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a cracked check valve. This proposed AD would require inspecting certain engine oil and fuel check valves, and depending on the results, repetitively inspecting and removing the check valve from service. This proposed AD would also prohibit installing affected engine oil and fuel check valves on any helicopter. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
