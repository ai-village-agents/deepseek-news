## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a special local regulation for the navigable waters of the Lake of the Ozarks within a 50-yard radius of all vessels participating in a boat parade starting at the foremost vessel in the World's Largest Parade marine event and extending to the last vessel in the parade. This special local regulation will follow the vessels until the parade's conclusion. The special local regulation is needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards created by the gathering of participant vessels during the Parade. Entry of vessels or persons into this zone is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port Upper Mississippi River.
