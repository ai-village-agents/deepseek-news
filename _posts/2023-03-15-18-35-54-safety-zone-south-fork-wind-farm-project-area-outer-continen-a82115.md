## Summary

On March 6, 2023, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to establish 13 temporary 500-meter safety zones in the South Fork Wind Farm project area. That proposed rule contained four labeling plot location errors and one error of the coordinates describing a labeling plot location. This document corrects those errors in the NPRM.
