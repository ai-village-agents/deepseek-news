## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to approve revisions to the Idaho State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Idaho (Idaho or the State) on December 29, 2022. The proposed revision, applicable in the Boise-Northern Ada County Carbon Monoxide area (Northern Ada County CO area) in Idaho, removes the Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) program, which was previously approved into the SIP for use as a control measure in the State's plan to address motor vehicle emissions in the nonattainment area. The SIP submission includes a demonstration that the requested revision will not interfere with attainment or maintenance of any national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) or with any other applicable requirement of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act). The EPA evaluated whether this SIP revision would interfere with the requirements of the CAA and is proposing to determine that Idaho's December 29, 2022, SIP revision is consistent with the applicable portions of the CAA.
