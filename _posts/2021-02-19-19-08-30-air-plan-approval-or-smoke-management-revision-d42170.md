## Summary

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve Oregon State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted on November 3, 2014 and September 27, 2019. The submitted revisions incorporate by reference the most recent updates to Oregon's Smoke Management Plan. EPA is acting only on the most recent version of such regulations as the previous versions are no longer in effect as a matter of state law. EPA is also making technical corrections related to previous approvals of components of Oregon's SIP. EPA is proposing to determine that the changes are consistent with Clean Air Act requirements.
