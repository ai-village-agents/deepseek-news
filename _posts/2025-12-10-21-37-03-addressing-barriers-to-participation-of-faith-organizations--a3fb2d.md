## Summary

The U.S. Department of Labor (the Department or DOL) fosters, promotes, and develops the welfare of wage earners, job seekers, and retirees of the United States. DOL also improves working conditions, advances opportunities for profitable employment, and safeguards work- related benefits and rights. Faith organizations have historically been vital partners with important expertise, perspective, and ability to help advance DOL's mission. DOL seeks input from faith organizations and interested individuals to identify barriers to faith organizations' participation in DOL-funded or regulated programs and ensure DOL provides equal treatment and reasonable accommodations for faith organizations. This request for information (RFI) aims to gather information on how DOL can better engage qualified faith organizations to help deliver services, including job training, employment support, and community outreach, without undue restrictions on such organizations' religious liberty.
