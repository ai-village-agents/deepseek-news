## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is proposing to approve the State of Michigan's Underground Injection Control Class II (UIC) Program for primacy. EPA determined that the State's program is consistent with the provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) at Section 1425 to prevent underground injection activities that endanger underground sources of drinking water. The Agency's approval allows Michigan to implement and enforce its state regulations for UIC Class II injection wells located within the State. Michigan's authority excludes the regulation of injection well Classes I, III, IV, V and VI, and all wells in Indian country, as required by rule under the SDWA. The Agency requests public comment on this proposed rule and supporting documentation. In the "Rules and Regulations" section of this Federal Register, the Agency published EPA's approval of the State's program as a direct final rule without a prior proposed rule. If the Agency receives no adverse comment on the direct final rule, EPA will not take further action on this proposed rule.
