## Summary

NHTSA invites public comments about our intention to request approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for a new information collection. Before a federal agency can collect certain information from the public, it must receive approval from OMB. Under procedures established by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, before seeking OMB approval, federal agencies must solicit public comment on proposed collections of information, including extensions and reinstatement of previously approved collections. This document describes a new collection of information, for which NHTSA intends to seek OMB approval, for obtaining motor vehicle model year and child restraint information that supports compliance programs administered by NHTSA's Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance (OVSC).
