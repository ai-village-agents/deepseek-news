## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary special local regulation on the Ohio River between mile marker (MM) 466 to 475, and on the Licking River between MM 0.0 to 0.3. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters near Cincinnati, OH during America's River Roots event from October 8, 2025, through October 13, 2025. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the regulated area unless authorized by the Captain of the Sector Ohio Valley or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
