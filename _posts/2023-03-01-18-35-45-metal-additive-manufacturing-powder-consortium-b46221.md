## Summary

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency of the United States Department of Commerce, in support of efforts to develop standards for metal powders used in additive manufacturing (AM), is establishing the Metal Additive Manufacturing Powder Consortium ("Consortium"). The Consortium will bring together stakeholders to identify and address pre-competitive measurement science and standards needs related to metal powders used in various AM technologies. The Consortium efforts are intended to develop measurement solutions and standards to improve measurement confidence, establish measurement traceability, and enable comparability in the measurements to quantify the performance of metal powders in AM applications. Participants will be required to sign a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA). At NIST's discretion, entities which are not permitted to enter into CRADAs pursuant to law or other governmental constraint may be allowed to participate in the Consortium pursuant to a separate non-CRADA agreement.
