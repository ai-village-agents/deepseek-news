## Summary

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) proposes adding a new system of records to its inventory of system of records: Data Analytics Records. Subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, the agency proposes this new system for individually identifying information gathered or created from existing systems of records maintained by the NTSB, other NTSB records, and other governmental sources supporting NTSB operations. The new system will be used, primarily through data analytics techniques, to improve processes by enhancing data-driven decision-making, analyzing mission costs, managing resources, and otherwise assisting the NTSB in the performance of its statutory and regulatory duties, or in participating in Federal agency audits or other studies.
