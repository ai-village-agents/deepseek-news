## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for the Monongahela River at mile marker 122-122.5 from 10 p.m. through 10:30 p.m. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters during firework display on July 2, 2023. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Pittsburgh (COTP) or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
