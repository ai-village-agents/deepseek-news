## Summary

As part of its on-going commitment to advancing sustainable acquisition, the General Services Administration (GSA) is exploring opportunities to reduce or eliminate potential per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) chemicals with the intent to reduce exposure from products offered to the Government through GSA's contract solutions. GSA is publishing this notice to request comments to help us understand potential areas for focus, and to identify potential unintended negative impacts. At this time, GSA has not determined whether or not it should work towards a notice of proposed rule-making to address this topic.
