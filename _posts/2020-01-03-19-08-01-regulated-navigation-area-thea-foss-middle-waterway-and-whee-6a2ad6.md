## Summary

The Coast Guard is amending the Thea Foss and Wheeler-Osgood Regulated Navigation Area (RNA) for Commencement Bay to establish a permanent regulated navigation area within the Middle Waterway. This action is necessary to protect sediment cap areas in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Commencement Bay Nearshore-Tideflats Superfund Cleanup Site within the Middle Waterway. This RNA would prohibit certain activities that could disrupt the integrity of the engineered sediment caps placed within the Middle Waterway.
