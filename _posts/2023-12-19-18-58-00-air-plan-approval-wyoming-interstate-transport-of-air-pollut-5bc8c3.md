## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing approval of the portion of a Wyoming State Implementation Plan (SIP) submission addressing interstate transport for the 2015 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). The "good neighbor" or "interstate transport" provision requires that each state's SIP contain adequate provisions to prohibit emissions from within the state from significantly contributing to nonattainment or interfering with maintenance of the NAAQS in other states. This requirement is part of the broader set of "infrastructure" requirements, which are designed to ensure that the structural components of each state's air quality management program are adequate to meet the state's responsibilities under the Clean Air Act (CAA).
