## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A318-112 airplanes; Model A319-115, -132, -133, -151N, -153N, and -171N airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -231, -232, - 251N, -252N, -253N, -271N, -272N, and -273N airplanes; and Model A321- 112 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that the fatigue life limit of the motoreductor installed on the on-board entrance stairs is not demonstrated for the complete airplane design service goal (DSG). This AD requires repetitive replacement of the motoreductor for onboard entrance stairs, and it limits the installation of affected parts under certain conditions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
