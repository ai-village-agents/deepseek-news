## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Reedsburg Municipal Airport, Reedsburg, WI, contained within the Baraboo, WI, airspace legal description, and Boscobel Airport, Boscobel, WI. The FAA is proposing these actions as the result of airspace reviews caused by the decommissioning of the Lone Rock VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) navigation aid, which provided navigation information for the instrument procedures at these airports, as part of the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program. The name and geographic coordinates of Baraboo-Wisconsin Dells Regional Airport, Baraboo, WI, and geographic coordinates of Boscobel Airport would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database. Airspace redesign is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at these airports.
