## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) publishes an annual procurement scorecard (Scorecard) that scores agencies on their performance in contracting with small businesses. This notice sets forth SBA's method for reflecting negative-dollar transactions (or "deobligations") in the SBA scorecard starting with the Fiscal Year 2022 (FY22) scorecard. For purposes of calculating prime contracting achievements, SBA will exclude deobligations associated with certain older awards.
