## Summary

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) is adopting changes to part II of the Federal Reserve Policy on Payment System Risk (PSR policy) substantially as proposed. The changes expand the eligibility of depository institutions to request collateralized intraday credit from the Federal Reserve Banks (Reserve Banks) while reducing administrative steps for requesting collateralized intraday credit. In addition, the Board is adopting changes to the PSR policy that clarify the eligibility standards for accessing uncollateralized intraday credit from Reserve Banks and modify the impact of a holding company's or affiliate's supervisory rating on an institution's eligibility to request uncollateralized intraday credit capacity. The Board is also adopting changes to part II of the PSR policy to support the deployment of the FedNow\SM\ Service (FedNow Service). Finally, the Board is simplifying the Federal Reserve Policy on Overnight Overdrafts (Overnight Overdrafts policy) and incorporating into the PSR policy as part III.
