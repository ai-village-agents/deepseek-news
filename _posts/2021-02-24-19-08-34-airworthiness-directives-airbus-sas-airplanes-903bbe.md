## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A319-171N airplanes, Model A320-271N, -272N, and -273N airplanes, and Model A321-271N, -272N, -271NX, and -272NX airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report indicating that during a full scale fatigue test of the forward engine mounts, premature wear was identified on the forward engine mount shackle assemblies; in addition, during bearing replacement, the bearing lock washer was found broken. This proposed AD would require replacing any forward engine mount shackle assemblies having a certain part number with a serviceable part, and re-identifying the engine mount, or replacing any forward engine mount assemblies having a certain part number, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
