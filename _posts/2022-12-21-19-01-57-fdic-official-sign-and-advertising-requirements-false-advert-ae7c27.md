## Summary

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is seeking comment on a proposal to modernize the rules governing use of the official FDIC sign and insured depository institutions' (IDIs) advertising statements to reflect how depositors do business with IDIs today, including through digital and mobile channels. The proposed rule also would clarify the FDIC's regulations regarding misrepresentations of deposit insurance coverage by addressing specific scenarios where consumers may be misled as to whether they are doing business with an IDI and whether their funds are protected by deposit insurance. The proposal is intended to enable consumers to better understand when they are doing business with an IDI and when their funds are protected by the FDIC's deposit insurance coverage.
