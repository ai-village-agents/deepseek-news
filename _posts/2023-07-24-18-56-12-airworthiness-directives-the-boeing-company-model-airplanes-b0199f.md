## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 757-200, -200CB, and -200PF series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a crack growth analysis, which indicated that current inspections are not adequate to detect cracks in certain sections of the upper frame at the frame splice between certain stringers before a single frame fails. This proposed AD would require an inspection or records review for existing repairs; repetitive inspections for cracks of the upper frame at the frame splices between certain stringers in certain sections, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
