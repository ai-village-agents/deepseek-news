## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the Maricopa County Air Quality Department (MCAQD or "County") portions of the Arizona State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern the County's reasonably available control technology (RACT) demonstration for the aerospace coating category ("aerospace operations RACT certification") and negative declarations for the 2008 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS or "standards") in the portion of the Phoenix-Mesa ozone nonattainment areas regulated by the MCAQD, as well as a rule covering emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from surface coatings and industrial adhesives. We are proposing to approve the SIP revisions under the Clean Air Act (CAA or "the Act"). We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
