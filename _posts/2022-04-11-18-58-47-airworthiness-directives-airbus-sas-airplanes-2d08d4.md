## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-03-25, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2019-03-25 requires repetitive inspections of the center and outer wing box lower stiffeners and panels at a certain junction on the left- and right-hand sides for any cracking, and repair if necessary. AD 2019-03-25 also provides an optional modification, which would terminate the repetitive inspections. Since the FAA issued AD 2019-03-25, it has been determined that, for certain airplanes, the compliance time for the initial inspection is inadequate and must be revised. This proposed AD continues to require the actions specified in AD 2019-03-25 with revised compliance times for certain airplanes and additional actions for certain airplanes, and expands the applicability, as specified in a European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
