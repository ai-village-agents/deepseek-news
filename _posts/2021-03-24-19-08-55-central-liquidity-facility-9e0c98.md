## Summary

In response to the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, (CAA) the NCUA Board (Board) is issuing this interim final rule to cohere the NCUA's regulations to the statutory changes made by the CAA. Specifically, the CAA extended several enhancements to the NCUA's Central Liquidity Facility (CLF or Facility), which were first enacted by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). This rule amends the NCUA's CLF regulation to reflect these extensions. This rule also extends the withdrawal from CLF membership provisions that the Board included in the April 2020 interim final rule that made the aforementioned regulatory changes related to the CARES Act.
