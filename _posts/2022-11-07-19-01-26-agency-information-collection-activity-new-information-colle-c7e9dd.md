## Summary

On July 18, 2022, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) announced its intention in a Federal Register Notice (87 FR 42796) to request that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approve the following information collection: The Freight Logistics Optimization Works (FLOW) Project. Over the past several years, the U.S. supply chain has struggled with unprecedented congestion under COVID-induced surges of containerized cargo through our ports and intermodal networks. In March of this year, the White House announced the launch of the Freight Logistics Optimization Works (FLOW) initiative with the Department of Transportation and the freight industry to facilitate a collaboration and sharing of intermodal trade data. This collaboration would help improve supply chain efficiencies and reduce overall costs to U.S. consumers. The FLOW initiative builds on previous work by the Administration's Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force to ensure the expeditious movement of cargo from ship to shelf. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, BTS announces its plan to submit the Information Collection Request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review and approval. BTS encouraged interested parties to submit comments to docket number 2022- 15247, during the 60-day comment period. No comments were received.
