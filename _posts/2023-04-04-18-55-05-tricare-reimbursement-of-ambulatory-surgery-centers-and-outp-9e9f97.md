## Summary

The DoD is amending TRICARE reimbursement of ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) and outpatient services provided in Cancer and Children's Hospitals (CCHs). These amendments are in accordance with the TRICARE statute that requires TRICARE's payment methodologies for institutional care be determined, to the extent practicable, in accordance with the same reimbursement rules as apply to payments to providers of services of the same type under Medicare. In accordance with this requirement, TRICARE finalizes the adoption of Medicare's payment methodology for ASCs, and adoption of Medicare's payment methodology for outpatient services provided in CCHs as set forth in this final rule.
