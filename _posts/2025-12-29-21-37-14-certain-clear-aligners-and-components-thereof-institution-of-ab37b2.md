## Summary

Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on September 23, 2025, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of Align Technology, Inc. of Tempe, Arizona. A letter supplementing the complaint was filed on November 20, 2025. The complaint, as supplemented, alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain clear aligners and components thereof by reason of the infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 11,766,313 ("the '313 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 11,766,314 ("the '314 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 8,899,977 ("the '977 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 12,059,321 ("the '321 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 10,980,616 ("the '616 patent"); and U.S. Patent No. 11,490,996 ("the '996 patent"). The complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The complainant requests that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a limited exclusion order and cease and desist orders.
