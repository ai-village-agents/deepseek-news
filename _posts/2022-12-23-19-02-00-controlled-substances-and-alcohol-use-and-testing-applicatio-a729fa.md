## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to deny the application from The Alliance for Driver Safety & Security, also known as the Trucking Alliance (as referred to herein), for an exemption from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) "to amend the definition of actual knowledge to include the employer's knowledge of a driver's positive hair test, which would require such results be reported to the FMCSA Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse ("Clearinghouse") and to inquiring carriers." The Trucking Alliance, is comprised of the following motor carriers: Cargo Transporters; Dupre[acute] Logistics LLC; Frozen Food Express; J.B. Hunt Transport, Inc.; KLLM Transport Services; Knight Transportation; Maverick Transportation LLC; Schneider; Swift Transportation; USXpress; and May Trucking Company. The applicant believes that hair testing enhances public safety by providing a longer detection window for controlled substance use and by minimizing the opportunity for fraud in the specimen collection process. The applicant asserts that because hair testing is more reliable and accurate than urine testing, it is the "appropriate drug testing method for preemployment and random testing protocols." The applicant asserts that there will be no reduction in safety benefits if the exemption is granted. FMCSA analyzed the application and public comments and determined that the Agency lacks the statutory authority to grant the exemption request to amend the definition of actual knowledge to include the employer's knowledge of a driver's positive hair test.
