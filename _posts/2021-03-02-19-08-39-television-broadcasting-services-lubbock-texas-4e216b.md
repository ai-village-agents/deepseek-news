## Summary

The Commission has before it a petition for rulemaking (Petition) filed by Gray Television Licensee, LLC (Gray or the Petitioner), licensee of KCBD, channel 11, Lubbock, Texas, requesting the substitution of UHF channel 36 for VHF channel 11 at Lubbock in the DTV Table of Allotments. Gray states that many of its viewers experience significant difficulty receiving the station's VHF signal and that all but 350 of the 414,091 persons currently served by KCBD will continue to be well served by at least five other stations, a number which the Commission has recognized as de minimus.
