## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) has suspended the antidumping duty investigation on white grape juice concentrate (WGJC) from Argentina. The basis for this action is an agreement between Commerce and signatory producers/exporters accounting for substantially all imports of WGJC from Argentina, wherein each signatory producer/ exporter has agreed to revise its prices to eliminate completely the injurious effects of exports of the subject merchandise to the United States.
