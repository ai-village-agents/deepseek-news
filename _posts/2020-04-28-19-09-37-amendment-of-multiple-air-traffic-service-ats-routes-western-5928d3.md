## Summary

This action amends three domestic VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways (V-113, V-137, and V-485) in the Western United States. The modifications are necessary due to the planned decommissioning of Priest, CA, VOR navigation aid (NAVAID), which provides navigation guidance for portions of the affected air traffic service (ATS) routes. The Priest, CA, VOR is being decommissioned as part of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
