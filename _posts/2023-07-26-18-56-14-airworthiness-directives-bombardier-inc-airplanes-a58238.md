## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-100-1A10 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of unexpected pitch upset upon autopilot disconnect. This AD requires revising the Non-Normal Procedures section of the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) associated with Auto Flight. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
