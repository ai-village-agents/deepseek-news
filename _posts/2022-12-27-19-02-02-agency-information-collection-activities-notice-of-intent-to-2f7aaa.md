## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("Commission" or "CFTC") is announcing an opportunity for public comment on the renewal of collection of certain information by the Commission's Office of Customer Education and Outreach ("OCEO"). Under the Paperwork Reduction Act ("PRA"), Federal agencies are required to publish notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed or renewal of a collection of information and to allow 60 days for public comment. The Commission is soliciting comments for the renewal of its generic information collection that will help the CFTC satisfy responsibilities under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank Act"), found in Section 748 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The generic information collection will provide the OCEO a means to gather qualitative consumer and stakeholder feedback in an efficient, timely manner to facilitate service delivery.
