## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary security zone on the Detroit River, in the vicinity of Detroit, MI. This zone is intended to restrict vessels from a portion of the Detroit River for the security of the spectators and participance of the 2024 NFL Draft from the public, and surrounding waterways from terrorist acts, sabotage or other subversive acts, accidents, or other causes of a similar nature. Persons and vessels are prohibited from entering into, transiting through, or anchoring within the security zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Detroit (COTP), or a designated representative. This temporary security zone is necessary to protect national security.
