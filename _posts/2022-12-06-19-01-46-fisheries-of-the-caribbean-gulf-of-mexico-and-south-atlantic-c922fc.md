## Summary

NMFS proposes to implement management measures described in a framework action under the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP), as prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council). If implemented, this proposed rule would increase catch levels for vermilion snapper in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf). The purpose of this proposed rule is to prevent overfishing of Gulf vermilion snapper and to achieve optimum yield (OY).
