## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") has tentatively determined that portable electric spas qualify as a covered product under Part A of Title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended ("EPCA"). DOE has tentatively determined that coverage of portable electric spas is necessary and appropriate to carry out the purposes of EPCA and that the average U.S. household energy use for portable electric spas is likely to exceed 100 kilowatt-hours per year.
