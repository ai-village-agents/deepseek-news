## Summary

Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) gives notice of a proposal to revise an existing Privacy Act system of records. The revised system is the Examination and Supervision System (ESS), NCUA-22. The ESS will continue to be used for NCUA's statutorily mandated examination and supervision activities, including the coordination and conduct of examinations of credit unions, supervisory evaluations and analyses, enforcement actions and Federal court actions. NCUA may coordinate with other financial regulatory agencies on matters related to the safety and soundness of credit unions. This revised system will continue to track and store examination and supervision documents created during the performance of the NCUA's statutory duties including recordings of meetings between NCUA and credit unions.
