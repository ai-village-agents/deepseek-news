## Summary

NMFS corrects an error in the final rule designating critical habitat for threatened Caribbean corals that published in the Federal Register on August 9, 2023. The final rule incorrectly identified the northern geographic extent of critical habitat designated for Orbicella franksi as St. Lucie Inlet, Martin County, Florida in the "Table of the Locations of the Critical Habitat Units for Orbicella franksi, O. annularis, O. faveolata, Dendrogyra cylindrus, and Mycetophyllia ferox," codified at 50 CFR 266.230(b) and in Table 4 of the Critical Habitat Unit Descriptions in the preamble of the rule. This correcting amendment fixes that error by revising the description of the geographic extent of the OFRA-1 Unit to refer to Lake Worth Inlet, Palm Beach County, Florida.
