## Summary

The Employee Benefits Security Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor (the Department) is publishing this Request for Information to solicit public feedback and to begin developing a public record for a number of provisions of Division T of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, (Dec. 29, 2022) (referred to as the SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 or SECURE 2.0) that impact the reporting and disclosure framework of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Several sections of SECURE 2.0 establish new, or revise existing, ERISA reporting and disclosure requirements, in some cases also requiring that the Department undertake a review of existing or new requirements and submit reports to Congress on the Department's findings. The Department believes that it will be helpful to initiate several of these actions, given their commonality in affecting reporting of information to the Department and the disclosure of information to retirement plan participants and beneficiaries, in this Request for Information. Any later action by the Department on these SECURE 2.0 provisions, whether rulemaking or otherwise, will be better informed by responses to this Request for Information.
