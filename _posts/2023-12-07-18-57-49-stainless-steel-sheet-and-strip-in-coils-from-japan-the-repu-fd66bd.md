## Summary

As a result of the determinations by the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) orders on stainless steel sheet and strip in coils (SSSSC) from Japan, the Republic of Korea (Korea), and Taiwan and the countervailing duty (CVD) order on SSSSC from Korea would likely lead to the continuation or recurrence of dumping, countervailable subsidies, and material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation of these AD and CVD orders.
