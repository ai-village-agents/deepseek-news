## Summary

The Department of Energy (DOE) is issuing this record of decision (ROD) for the Versatile Test Reactor (VTR) pursuant to the Final Versatile Test Reactor Environmental Impact Statement (VTR EIS) (DOE/EIS-0542). DOE prepared the VTR EIS to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of alternatives for constructing and operating a VTR and the associated facilities required for post-irradiation examination of test and experimental fuels and materials. DOE has decided to implement its Preferred Alternative, to construct and operate a VTR at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Site, and to establish, through modification and construction, co-located facilities for post-irradiation examination of test products and for management of spent VTR driver fuel at INL. The VTR will operate as a national user facility, providing a fast-neutron-spectrum test capability for the testing and development of advanced nuclear technologies. DOE has not decided whether to establish VTR driver fuel production capabilities at the INL Site, the Savannah River Site (SRS), or a combination of the two sites. Once a preferred alternative or option for VTR driver fuel production is identified, DOE will announce its preference in a Federal Register (FR) notice. DOE would then publish a ROD no sooner than 30 days after its announcement of a preferred alternative/option for VTR driver fuel production.
