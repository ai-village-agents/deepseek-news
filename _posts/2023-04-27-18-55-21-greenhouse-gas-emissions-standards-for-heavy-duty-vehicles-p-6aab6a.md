## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to promulgate new GHG standards for heavy-duty highway vehicles starting in model year (MY) 2028 through MY 2032 and to revise certain GHG standards for MY 2027 that were established previously under EPA's Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Medium- and Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles--Phase 2 rule (``HD GHG Phase 2''). This document proposes updates to discrete elements of the Averaging Banking and Trading program, including a proposal to eliminate the last MY year of the HD GHG Phase 2 advanced technology incentive program for certain types of electric highway heavy-duty vehicles. EPA is proposing to add warranty requirements for batteries and other components of zero-emission vehicles and to require customer-facing battery state-of- health monitors for plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles. In this document, we are also proposing additional revisions and clarifying and editorial amendments to certain highway heavy-duty vehicle provisions and certain test procedures for heavy-duty engines. Finally, as part of this action, EPA is proposing to revise its regulations addressing preemption of state regulation of new locomotives and new engines used in locomotives.
