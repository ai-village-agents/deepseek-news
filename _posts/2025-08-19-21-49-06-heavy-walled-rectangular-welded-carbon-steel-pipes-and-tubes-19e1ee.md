## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) published notice in the Federal Register on July 24, 2025, in which Commerce announced the final results of the 2022-2023 administrative review of the antidumping duty (AD) order on heavy-walled rectangular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes (HWR) from Mexico. In the final results, Commerce incorrectly assigned a review-specific cash deposit rate of 11.80 percent to certain non-examined companies for which the review was rescinded in the Preliminary Results. Commerce is correcting two items in the final results.
