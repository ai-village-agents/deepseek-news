## Summary

On February 18, 2025, the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) issued its final judgment in PT. Zinus et al. v. United States, Slip Op. 25-15, Consol. Ct. No. 21-277, (February 18, 2025) (PT. Zinus III), sustaining the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce)'s second remand redetermination pertaining to the antidumping (AD) duty investigation of mattresses from Indonesia covering the period of investigation January 1, 2019, through December 31, 2019. Commerce is notifying the public that the CIT's final judgment is not in harmony with Commerce's final determination in that investigation, and that Commerce is amending the final determination from affirmative to negative as a result of the dumping margin assigned to PT. Zinus Global Indonesia (Zinus Indonesia) changing from 2.22 percent to 0.00 percent. Thus, Commerce is revoking the AD order on mattresses from Indonesia.
