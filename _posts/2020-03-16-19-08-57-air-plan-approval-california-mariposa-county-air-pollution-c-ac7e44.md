## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the Mariposa County Air Pollution Control District (MCAPCD) portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). This revision concerns reporting of emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) in nonattainment areas. We are proposing to approve a local rule to require submittal of emissions statements under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act). We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
