## Summary

By this rule, the Department of Commerce (Commerce) is eliminating its regulations establishing the procedures for a Voluntary Consumer Product Information Labeling Program (CPILP), as that program is now inactive, outdated, and unnecessary. This action is necessary to eliminate obsolete and unwarranted regulatory language from the Code of Federal Regulations and to ensure that Commerce's regulations remain accurate and up-to-date. The intended effect of this action is to improve and streamline Commerce's regulations and to reduce the risk of public confusion.
