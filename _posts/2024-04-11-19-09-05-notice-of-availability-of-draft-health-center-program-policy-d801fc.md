## Summary

HRSA is inviting public comment on the draft Health Center Program Policy Guidance Regarding Services to Support Transitions in Care for Justice-Involved Individuals Reentering the Community. The purpose of the draft Policy Information Notice (PIN) is to propose Health Center Program policy guidance for all health centers that apply for and receive federal award funds under the Health Center Program, as authorized by section 330 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (including sections 330(e), (g), (h), and (i)), as well as section 330 subrecipient organizations and Health Center Program look-alikes, to clarify the conditions under which they may provide certain health services as part of the Health Center Program scope of project to certain incarcerated/detained individuals. This draft PIN establishes policy guidance that identifies a set of health services that a health center may provide, the locations at which such services may be provided, the target population for such services (specifically, incarcerated/detained individuals who are scheduled for release from a carceral setting within 90 days), and other pertinent circumstances under which the health center may, on its own behalf and subject to all section 330 requirements, provide such services to justice-involved individuals reentering the community to support their care transition from the carceral setting to the community within the scope of their Health Center Program project.
