## Summary

On July 27, 2016, in Docket No. EP 711 (Sub-No. 1), the Surface Transportation Board (Board or STB) proposed to revise its reciprocal switching regulations. After considering the full record and the developments in the freight rail industry, the Board has decided not to pursue those revisions and to close Docket No. EP 711 (Sub-No. 1). Instead, in Docket No. EP 711 (Sub-No. 2), the Board is proposing a new set of regulations that would provide access to reciprocal switching when there is inadequate service. The Board will continue to assess what other action, if any, the Board should take with respect to reciprocal switching.
