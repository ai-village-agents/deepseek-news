## Summary

The Postal Service is revising its Hazardous, Restricted and Perishable Mail regulations by replacing Publication 52, Hazardous, Restricted, and Perishable Mail, Appendix C, Packaging Instructions 6C, currently incorporated by reference, to support the rapid deployment of coronavirus (COVID-19) diagnostic tests using the mail during this public health emergency. In addition to the updated packaging instructions, all shippers of COVID-19 related Infectious Substances Category B UN3373 must obtain authorization from the Postal Service prior to mailing. These measures are necessary to ensure that diagnostic kits potentially containing Category B Infectious Substances are packaged, marked and labelled properly to ensure safety and containment throughout transport.
