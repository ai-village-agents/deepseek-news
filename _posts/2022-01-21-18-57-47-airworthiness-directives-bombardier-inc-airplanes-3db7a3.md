## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-22- 06, which applied to certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-2B16 (601- 3A, 601-3R, and 604 Variants) airplanes. AD 2017-22-06 required repetitive inspections for fuel leakage at the engine and auxiliary power unit (APU) fuel pumps, and related investigative and corrective actions if necessary. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2017-22- 06, and requires an inspection of the APU, repair if necessary, and modification of the engine electrical fuel pump (EFP) installation. This AD also adds airplanes to the applicability. This AD was prompted by reports of fuel leaks from the electrical connectors and conduits of the engine and APU EFP cartridge/canister, and the development of additional actions to address the root cause of the fuel leaks. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
