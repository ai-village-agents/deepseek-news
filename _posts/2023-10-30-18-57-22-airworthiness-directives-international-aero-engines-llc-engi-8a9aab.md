# Airworthiness Directives; International Aero Engines, LLC Engines

**Published:** February 05, 2026 18:57 UTC

**Document Number:** 2023-23929

## Summary

The FAA is correcting an airworthiness directive (AD) that was published in the Federal Register. That AD applies to certain International Aero Engines, LLC (IAE LLC) Model PW1124G1-JM, PW1127G- JM, PW1127GA-JM, PW1129G-JM, PW1130G-JM, PW1133G-JM, and PW1133GA-JM engines. As published, a part number was inadvertently excluded in the regulatory text of the AD. This document corrects that error. In all other respects, the original document remains the same.
