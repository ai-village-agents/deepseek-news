## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to find that the Indiana portion of the Chicago-Naperville, IL-IN-WI area (Chicago area) is attaining the 2008 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS or standard) and to redesignate the Indiana portion of the Chicago area to attainment for the 2008 ozone NAAQS, because the request meets the statutory requirements for redesignation under the Clean Air Act (CAA). EPA is proposing to approve, as a revision to the Indiana State Implementation Plan (SIP), the State's plan for maintaining the 2008 ozone NAAQS through 2035 in the Chicago area. EPA is also proposing to approve a waiver, for the Indiana portion of the Chicago area, from the oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) requirements of the CAA. EPA finds adequate and is proposing to approve Indiana's 2030 and 2035 volatile organic compound (VOC) and NO<INF>X</INF> Motor Vehicle Emission Budgets for the Indiana portion of the Chicago area. Finally, the VOC reasonably available control technology (RACT), clean- fuel vehicle programs (CFVP), enhanced monitoring of ozone and ozone precursors (EMP), and Enhanced motor vehicle Inspection/Maintenance (I/ M) SIP revisions. These SIP revisions satisfy the above requirements for a nonattainment area that is classified as a "Serious area" for the Indiana portion of the Chicago area under the 2008 ozone NAAQS.
