## Summary

This action amends the Class D and Class E airspace at Marshall AAF, Fort Riley, KS, and Manhattan Regional Airport, Manhattan, KS, and establishes Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Marshall AAF and Freeman Field, Junction City, KS. This action is the result of airspace reviews due to the decommissioning of the Calvary and McDowell Creek non-directional beacons (NDBs). The names and geographic coordinates of the airports and navigational aids are also being updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
