## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for certain waters of Betsie Lake in Frankfort, MI. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters during the swim portion of an Ironman event on September 11, 2022. This proposed rulemaking would restrict usage by persons and vessels within the safety zone. At no time during the effective period may vessels transit the waters of Betsie Lake in the vicinity of a triangular shaped race course enclosed by the following three coordinates: 44[deg]37.80' N, -086[deg]13.91' W to 44[deg]37.81' N, -086[deg]14.22' W to 44[deg]37.58' N, -086[deg]13.75' W, then back to the starting point. The race course will be marked by buoys. These restrictions would apply to all perons and vessels during the effective period unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Lake Michigan or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
