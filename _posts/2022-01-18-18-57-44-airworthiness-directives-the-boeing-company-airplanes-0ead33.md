## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 747-400, -400D, and -400F series airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of burned Boeing Material Specification (BMS) 8-39 urethane foam, and a report from the airplane manufacturer that airplanes were assembled with seals throughout various areas of the airplane (including flight deck and cargo compartments) made of BMS 8-39 urethane foam, a material with fire- retardant properties that deteriorate with age. This AD requires replacing the system tube/wire seals made of BMS 8-39 urethane foam in certain areas of the airplane. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
