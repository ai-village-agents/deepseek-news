## Summary

This document contains temporary regulations setting forth mandatory information and registration requirements for taxpayers planning to make an elective payment election under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and the CHIPS Act of 2022 to treat the amount of certain tax credits as a payment of Federal income tax, or in the case of a partnership or S corporation, to receive a payment in the amount of such credits. This document also contains temporary regulations setting forth mandatory information and registration requirements for taxpayers planning to make an election to transfer certain Federal income tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. These temporary regulations affect tax-exempt organizations, State and local governments, Indian tribal governments, Alaska Native Corporations, the Tennessee Valley Authority, rural electric cooperatives, and, in the case of three credits, certain taxpayers eligible to elect the elective payment of credit amounts in a taxable year under section 6417 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). These temporary regulations also affect taxpayers eligible to make an elective payment election instead of claiming the advanced manufacturing investment credit under section 48D of the Code. These temporary regulations further affect taxpayers eligible to elect to transfer certain Federal income tax credits under section 6418 of the Code.
