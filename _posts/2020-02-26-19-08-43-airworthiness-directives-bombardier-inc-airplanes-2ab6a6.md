## Summary

The FAA is correcting an airworthiness directive (AD) that published in the Federal Register. That AD applies to certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-2B19 (Regional Jet series 100 & 440) airplanes. As published, paragraph (h)(2) of that AD specifies an incorrect service information reference for performing the inspection. This document corrects that error. In all other respects, the original document remains the same.
