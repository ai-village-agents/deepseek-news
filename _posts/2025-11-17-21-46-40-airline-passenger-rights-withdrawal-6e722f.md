## Summary

The Department is withdrawing the ANPRM on Airline Passenger Rights issued on December 11, 2024. The ANPRM sought public comment on a potential regulatory action that would require airlines to provide passengers affected by significant flight disruptions with a variety of costly measures. The withdrawal of this ANPRM is consistent with Executive Order (E.O.) 14192, "Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation," which directs Federal agencies to reduce regulatory burdens, and E.O. 14219, "Ensuring Lawful Governance and Implementation of the President's `Department of Government Efficiency' Deregulatory Agenda," which directs Federal agencies to identify and to repeal or to modify regulations that are unlawful or unauthorized.
