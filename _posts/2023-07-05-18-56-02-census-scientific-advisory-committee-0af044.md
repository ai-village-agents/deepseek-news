## Summary

The Census Bureau is giving notice of a virtual meeting of the Census Scientific Advisory Committee (CSAC or Committee). From August 17-November 15, 2022, the Census Bureau posted a Federal Register notice to seek input from the public to develop and implement strategies to improve participation in the 2030 Census. During the CSAC Spring 2023 meeting, the Committee was asked to evaluate the comments received and provide the top ten research ideas for four of five categories, which included: technology, new data sources, how we contact respondents, and respondent support services. During this virtual meeting, the Committee will provide the top ten research ideas for the comments related to the fifth category, reaching and motivating everyone. Last minute changes to the schedule are possible, which could prevent giving advance public notice of schedule adjustments.
