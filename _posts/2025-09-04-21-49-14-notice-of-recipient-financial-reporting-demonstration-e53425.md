## Summary

Through this notice, HUD solicits comments on a demonstration designed to increase understanding of how enhanced recipient reporting can help reduce the risk of fraud, waste, and abuse across grant programs. The demonstration will focus on testing HUD's design for a reporting portal to collect and analyze supporting financial evidence from recipients, including subrecipient information, to ensure that it is sufficient for its intended purpose. HUD will also refine the portal based on recommendations from participants. The demonstration will allow participants to increase HUD's understanding of the business process changes that may be needed by recipients in this future state. Approximately nine voluntary participants from three HUD grant programs will be included in this demonstration.
