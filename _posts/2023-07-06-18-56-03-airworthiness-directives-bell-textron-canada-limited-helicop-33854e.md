## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-24- 04, which applied to certain Bell Helicopter Textron Canada Limited (type certificate previously held by Bell Helicopter Textron Canada Limited) Model 505 helicopters. AD 2021-24-04 required revising the existing Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) for your helicopter. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-24-04, Bell Textron Canada Limited revised the RFM to incorporate more restrictive operating limitations. This AD is prompted by the determination that the existing altitude limitations were not valid for certain fuel types and that revising the existing RFM for your helicopter to align with the limitations of the Safran Helicopter Engines, S.A. Model ARRIUS 2R engine is necessary. This AD requires revising the existing RFM for your helicopter, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
