## Summary

The NCUA Board (Board) is proposing to amend the charitable donation accounts (CDA) section of the NCUA's incidental powers regulation. Specifically, the Board is proposing to add "war veterans' organizations" ("veterans' organizations"), as defined under section 501(c)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code, to the definition of a "qualified charity" that a federal credit union may contribute to using a CDA. The Board is also asking if there are other groups, entities, or organizations the Board should consider adding to the definition of a "qualified charity" to inform potential future rulemaking in this area.
