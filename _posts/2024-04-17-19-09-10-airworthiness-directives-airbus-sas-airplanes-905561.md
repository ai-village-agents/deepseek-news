## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-05- 16, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A319-115 airplanes; Model A320-214, -216, -232, -251N, and -271N airplanes; and Model A321-211, - 231, -251N, -251NX, -253N, -271N, -271NX, and -272N airplanes. AD 2020- 05-16 required a one-time detailed inspection of certain attaching points on the left-hand and right-hand wings for the correct installation of certain hardware, and, depending on findings, accomplishment of applicable corrective actions. This AD was prompted by reports of incomplete installations of the over wing panel lug attachments in the production assembly line and a determination that additional airplanes are subject to the unsafe condition. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2020-05-16 and adds airplanes to the applicability, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
