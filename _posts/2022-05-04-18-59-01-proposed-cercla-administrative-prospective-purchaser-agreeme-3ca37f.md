## Summary

In accordance with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and the terms of the proposed settlement agreements, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Region 5, hereby gives notice of two proposed administrative settlements concerning the U.S. Smelter and Lead Refinery, Inc., Site in East Chicago, Indiana (the "Site"): (1) A proposed administrative Prospective Purchaser Agreement (the "PPA"); and (2) a proposed Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent (the "ASAOC"). The EPA proposes to enter into the PPA with Industrial Development Advantage of East Chicago, LLC as purchaser ("Purchaser"). The PPA requires Purchaser to perform remedial action on a portion of the Site. The EPA proposes to enter into the ASAOC with Atlantic Richfield Company, The Chemours Company FC, LLC, E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, U.S. Smelter and Lead Refinery, Inc., and United States Metals Refining Company as respondents ("Respondents") and with Arava Natural Resources Company, Inc., Mining Remedial Recovery Company, and Mueller Industries, Inc., as additional covered parties ("Additional Covered Parties"). The ASAOC requires the Respondents to pay $18,000,000 in past response costs and provide financial assurance for the remedial action to be performed by Purchaser under the PPA. The State of Indiana joins the EPA as a party to both agreements. The EPA is also providing notice of a proposed Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) for the portion of the Site that is the subject of the PPA. The EPA plans to finalize the proposed ESD after the two factual prerequisites for the selected contingent remedy provided in the Record of Decision Amendment dated March 24, 2020 have been met. For thirty (30) days following the date of publication of this notice, the EPA will receive written comments on the settlements and the proposed ESD. The EPA will consider all comments received and may modify or withdraw its consent to the settlements if comments received disclose facts or considerations that indicate that the proposed settlements and the proposed ESD are inappropriate, improper, or inadequate. The EPA's response to any comments received will be available for public inspection at https:// www.epa.gov/uss-lead-superfund-site.
