## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for all navigable waters in the Illinois River at Mile Marker (MM) 162.7 through 163.3. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters near Peoria, IL, during a drone show on June 10, 2023. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Sector Upper Mississippi River or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
