## Summary

The Department of the Air Force (DAF) is issuing this Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to evaluate the potential environmental effects associated with the proposed acquisition of land for, and construction and operation of Homeland Defense Over-The-Horizon Radar (HLD-OTHR) transmission and receiver sites in the northwest region of the United States. Oregon Military Department (OMD) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) are cooperating agencies pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Once constructed, the HLD-OTHR would provide persistent, long- range early detection capabilities of airborne threats approaching North America. This EIS is prepared to meet the requirements of both NEPA and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. The Unique Identification Number for this EIS is EISX-007-57-UAF-1743672205.
