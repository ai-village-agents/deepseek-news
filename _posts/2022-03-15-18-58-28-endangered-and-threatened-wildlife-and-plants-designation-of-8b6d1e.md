## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), designate critical habitat for the Big Sandy crayfish (Cambarus callainus) and Guyandotte River crayfish (C. veteranus) under the Endangered Species Act (Act). In total, approximately 717 stream kilometers (446 stream miles) in Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia fall within the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The effect of this final rule is to designate critical habitat for the Big Sandy crayfish, which is a threatened species under the Act, and Guyandotte River crayfish, which is an endangered species under the Act.
