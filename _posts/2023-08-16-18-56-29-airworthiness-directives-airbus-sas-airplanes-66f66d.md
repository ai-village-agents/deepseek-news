## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A330-201, -202, -203, -301, -302, and -303 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of corrosion and cracks found on engine inlet attach fittings. This AD requires an inspection to determine whether affected engine inlet attach fittings are installed, and replacement of those affected engine inlet attach fittings or replacement with and inlet cowl having no affected engine inlet attach fittings, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also prohibits the installation of affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
