## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directives (ADs) 2005-15- 11, 2016-07-09, and 2018-19-24, which applied to all BAE Systems (Operations) Limited Model 4101 airplanes. AD 2005-15-11 required repetitive detailed and specialized inspections to detect fatigue damage in the fuselage, replacement of certain bolt assemblies, and corrective actions if necessary. AD 2016-07-09 required a revision of the maintenance or inspection program, as applicable. AD 2018-19-24 required a one-time detailed inspection of a certain fuselage frame and repair, if necessary, and a revision of the maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or revised maintenance instructions and airworthiness limitations. This AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD continues to require the actions in ADs 2016-07- 09 and 2018-19-24 and requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
