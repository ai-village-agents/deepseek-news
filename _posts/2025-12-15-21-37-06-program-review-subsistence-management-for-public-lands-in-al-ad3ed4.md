## Summary

Title VIII of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 (ANILCA) requires a subsistence priority for rural Alaska residents on federal public lands in Alaska, currently administered jointly by Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture (the Secretaries). The Office of the Senior Advisor to the Secretary of the Interior for Alaska Affairs and the Office of the Secretary of Agriculture are conducting a targeted review of the Federal Subsistence Management Program (Program) with joint recommendations for action to ensure the Program effectively and efficiently meets the needs of Alaska residents and the Secretaries' obligations under ANILCA. The focus of this review is on recent regulatory and organizational changes to the Program, along with discrete areas of interest. The scope of this review is intentionally targeted to build upon and evaluate the most recent Program review and changes with the benefit of the experience gained through implementation of those changes to date. A subsequent process is anticipated for any regulatory changes to the Program based on this review.
