# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus SAS Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A318, A319, A320, and A321 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports where the passenger door external handle mechanism was not retrieving its normal, flush position when the door was being closed. This proposed AD would require a one- time cleaning and lubrication of the external door handle mechanism of each affected door, and would limit the installation of affected parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
