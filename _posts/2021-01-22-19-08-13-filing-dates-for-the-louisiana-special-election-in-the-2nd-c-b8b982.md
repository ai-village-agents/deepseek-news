## Summary

Louisiana has scheduled a Special General Election on March 20, 2021, to fill its U.S. House of Representatives seat in the 2nd Congressional District being vacated by Representative Cedric L. Richmond. Under Louisiana law, a majority winner in a Special General Election is declared elected. Should no candidate achieve a majority vote, a Special Runoff Election will be held on April 24, 2021, between the top two vote-getters. Political committees participating in the Louisiana special elections are required to file pre- and post-election reports. Filing deadlines for these reports are affected by whether one or two elections are held.
