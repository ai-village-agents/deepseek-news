## Summary

The Secretary proposes to amend regulations for the Federal Pell Grant program, institutional eligibility, and student assistance general provisions. First, the Secretary proposes to establish regulations for Federal Pell Grants (Pell Grants or Pell) for Prison Education Programs (PEPs), to implement new statutory requirements to establish Pell Grant eligibility for a confined or incarcerated individual enrolled in a PEP. Second, the Secretary proposes to revise the Title IV Revenue and Non-Federal Education Assistance Funds regulations (referred to as "90/10" or the "90/10 Rule") to implement the statutory change in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP). The Secretary further proposes to amend which non-Federal funds can be counted when determining compliance with the 90/10 rule to align allowable non-Federal revenue more closely with statutory intent. Finally, the Secretary proposes regulations to clarify the process for consideration of changes in ownership and control, to promote compliance with the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), and related regulations and reduce risk for students and taxpayers, as well as institutions contemplating or undergoing such a change.
