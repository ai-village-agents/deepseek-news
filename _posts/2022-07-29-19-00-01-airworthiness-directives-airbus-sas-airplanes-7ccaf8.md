## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-26- 01, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A318-111, -112, -121, and - 122 airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; and Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and - 233 airplanes. AD 2020-26-01 required repetitive general visual inspections of the affected main landing gear (MLG) sliding tubes for cracks, and replacement if necessary. This AD was prompted by reports of cracks found on MLG sliding tubes that may have been subject to improperly performed magnetic particle inspection. This AD requires repetitive general visual inspections of the affected MLG sliding tubes (both retained affected parts and additional affected parts) for cracks, and replacement if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also adds airplanes to the applicability. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
