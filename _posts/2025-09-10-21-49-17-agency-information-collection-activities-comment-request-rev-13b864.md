## Summary

On July 2, 2025, the Department of Labor's (Department or DOL) Employment and Training Administration (ETA) and Wage and Hour Division issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM or proposed rule), "Recission of Final Rule: Improving Protections for Workers in Temporary Agricultural Employment in the United States," proposing to rescind provisions contained within the final rule published by the Department on April 29, 2024. The Department is notifying the public about its proposed revisions to the information collection request (ICR) covered under H-2A Temporary Agricultural Labor Certification Program (Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Control Number 1205- 0466) based on the changes proposed through the NPRM. The Department is seeking comments regarding its proposal to replace the existing information collection tools (e.g., forms and instructions) covered under OMB Control Number 1205-0466 with those that were required to implement the final rule "Temporary Agricultural Employment of H-2A Nonimmigrants in the United States" published on October 12, 2022 ("2022 Final Rule"), and which were covered under the same OMB Control Number, 1205-0466, while maintaining some changes put in place by the final rule published on April 29, 2024. This comment request is part of continuing Departmental efforts to reduce paperwork and respondent burden in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA).
