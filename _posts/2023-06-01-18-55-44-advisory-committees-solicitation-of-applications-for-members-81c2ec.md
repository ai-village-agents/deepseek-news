## Summary

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Consumer Financial Protection Act) section 1014 requires the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to establish a Consumer Advisory Board to advise and consult with the Bureau in the exercise of its functions under the Federal consumer financial laws, and to provide information on emerging practices in the consumer financial products or services industry, including regional trends, concerns, and other relevant information. Pursuant to the executive and administrative powers conferred on the CFPB by section 1012 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau established the discretionary committees, Community Bank Advisory Council, Credit Union Advisory Council, and Academic Research Council under agency authority in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended. This notice advises individuals who wish to serve as a member of the Consumer Advisory Board, Community Bank Advisory Council, Credit Union Advisory Council, or Academic Research Council, of the opportunity to be considered for those advisory committees. The CFPB expects to announce the selection of new members later this year.
