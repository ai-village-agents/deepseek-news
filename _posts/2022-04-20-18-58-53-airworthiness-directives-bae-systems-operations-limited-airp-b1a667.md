## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2008-16-06, which applies to all BAE Systems (Operations) Limited Model 4101 airplanes. AD 2008-16-06 requires the installation of additional bonding leads, inspection of existing bonding leads for defects, inspection of fuel system pipe runs in the wings to ensure appropriate clearances are maintained, and corrective actions. Since the FAA issued AD 2008-16-06, a safety analysis by BAE Systems (Operations) Limited identified insufficient bonding for the crossfeed valve in the fuel tank area. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2008-16-06, and add a requirement to install additional bonding leads around the crossfeed valve and accomplish a resistance check. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
