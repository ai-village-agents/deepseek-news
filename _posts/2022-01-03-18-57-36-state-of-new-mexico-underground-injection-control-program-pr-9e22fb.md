## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving an application from the State of New Mexico under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to revise the State's existing Underground Injection Control (UIC) program for Class I injection wells located within the State, except those in Indian country. New Mexico has revised the State's UIC Class I program regulations to establish new permit conditions, oversight, and enforcement to manage hazardous waste injection activities by petroleum refineries in such a manner that is protective of underground sources of drinking water. The State's Class I hazardous waste injection wells are only authorized for use by petroleum refineries for the waste generated by the refinery ("generator"). With this action, EPA is also codifying previously approved, non- substantial changes to the New Mexico UIC program. New Mexico will continue to implement and enforce a State UIC regulatory program that is as stringent as the existing federal program.
