## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or "Agency") is correcting the state implementation plan (SIP) for the State of California to remove from the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) revisions to the California SIP that were initially approved into the SIP in a June 25, 2020 final action that was subsequently vacated and remanded to the EPA by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. This action is exempt from notice-and-comment rulemaking because it is ministerial in nature.
