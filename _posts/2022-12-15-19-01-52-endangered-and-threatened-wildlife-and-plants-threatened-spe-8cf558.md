## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), determine that whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), a high-elevation tree species found across western North America, is a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. We also finalize a rule under the authority of section 4(d) of the Act that provides measures that are necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation of the species. We have determined that designation of critical habitat for the whitebark pine is not prudent at this time.
