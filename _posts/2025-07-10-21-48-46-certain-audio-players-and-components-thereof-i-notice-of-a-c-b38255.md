## Summary

Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission ("Commission") has determined to adopt an initial determination ("ID") (Order No. 39) issued by the presiding administrative law judge ("ALJ") granting respondent's motion for summary determination of invalidity of the asserted patent claims due to indefiniteness. The Commission previously vacated the ID's termination for "good cause." The investigation is terminated with a finding of no violation of section 337.
