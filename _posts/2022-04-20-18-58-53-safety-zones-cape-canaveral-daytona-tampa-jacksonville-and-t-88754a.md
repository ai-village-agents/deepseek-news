## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing five temporary safety zones for the reentry of capsules launched by Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (Space X) in support of the Axiom and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Crew-3 capsule recovery missions. These five temporary safety zones are located within the Coast Guard District Seven area of responsibility offshore of Cape Canaveral, Daytona, Jacksonville, Tampa, and Tallahassee, Florida. The purpose of this rule is to ensure the safety of vessels, mariners, and the navigable waters in the safety zones before, during, and after the scheduled event. This action is necessary to provide for the safe recovery of these capsules and astronauts in our exclusive economic zone and implements a special activities provision of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. This rule prohibits U.S. flagged vessels from being in the safety zones unless authorized by the Commander of the Seventh Coast Guard District or a designated representative.
