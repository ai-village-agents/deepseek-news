## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Lockheed Martin Corporation/Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company Model 382, 382B, 382E, 382F, 382G, and 382J airplanes; and Model C-130A, HP- C-130A, EC-130Q, 282-44A-05 (C-130B), C-130B, and C-130H airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report indicating a quality audit found aft fuselage sloping longerons manufactured with an overaged condition. This AD requires a conductivity check on certain aft fuselage sloping longerons and applicable on-condition actions. This AD also limits the installation of certain aft fuselage sloping longerons under certain conditions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
