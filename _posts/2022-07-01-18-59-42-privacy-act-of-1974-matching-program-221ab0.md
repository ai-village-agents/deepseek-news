## Summary

In accordance with the provisions of the Privacy Act, as amended, this notice announces a new matching program with the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). This matching agreement establishes the terms, conditions, and safeguards under which CMS will disclose to SSA Medicare non-utilization information for Social Security Title II beneficiaries aged 90 and above. CMS will identify Medicare enrollees whose records have been inactive for three or more years. SSA will use this data as an indicator to select and prioritize cases for review to determine continued eligibility for benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act (Act). SSA will contact these individuals to verify ongoing eligibility. SSA will use this data for the purposes of fraud discovery and the analysis of fraud program operations; this agreement allows for SSA's Office of Anti-Fraud Programs (OAFP) to evaluate the data for the purposes of fraud detection. SSA will refer individual cases of suspected fraud, waste, or abuse to the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) for investigation.
