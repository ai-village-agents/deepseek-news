## Summary

The Coast Guard issues this interim rule as the first step to implement the statutorily mandated requirements for DUKW amphibious passenger vessels. This statutory mandate was enacted after the sinking of the Stretch Duck 7 on July 19, 2018, which resulted in the loss of 17 lives on Table Rock Lake, Missouri. Section 11502 of the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 mandates additional safety measures for DUKW amphibious passenger vessels operating on navigable waters subject to Coast Guard jurisdiction. This interim final rule codifies the statutorily mandated requirements.
