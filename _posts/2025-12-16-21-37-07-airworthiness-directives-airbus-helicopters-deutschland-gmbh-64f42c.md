## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (AHD) Model BO-105A, BO-105C, BO- 105S, BO-105LS A-3, MBB-BK 117 A-3, MBB-BK 117 A-4, MBB-BK 117 B-1, MBB-BK 117 B-2, and MBB-BK 117 C-1 helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of a crack found on the fork lever of the mixing lever assembly. This AD requires visually inspecting the fork lever for cracks and the mixing lever assembly for missing components, damage, or corrosion. Depending on the results of these inspections, this AD requires taking corrective action and reporting the results of the inspection to the manufacturer. Lastly, this AD prohibits installing affected fork levers unless certain requirements are met. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
