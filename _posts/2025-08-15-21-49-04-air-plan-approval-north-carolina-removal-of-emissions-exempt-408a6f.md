## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve separate but related State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the North Carolina Division of Air Quality (NCDAQ). First, EPA is proposing to approve a SIP revision submitted by NCDAQ on behalf of the State of North Carolina on October 27, 2023, to remove certain exemptions available at the discretion of a State official for emissions exceeding otherwise applicable SIP emission limitations. Second, EPA is proposing to approve a SIP revision submitted by NCDAQ on behalf of Mecklenburg County Air Quality (MCAQ or Mecklenburg County) on October 25, 2023, to remove a parallel local exemption analogous to the State's for emissions exceeding otherwise applicable SIP emission limitations. In addition, EPA is proposing to approve minor and administrative changes to certain regulatory provisions that have been revised by the State and Mecklenburg County since EPA's last approval of those provisions. EPA is proposing to approve these SIP revisions pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act).
