## Summary

The FDIC is seeking comment on a proposed rule that would increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rates by 2 basis points, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The proposal would increase the likelihood that the reserve ratio would reach the required minimum level of 1.35 percent by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2028, consistent with the FDIC's Amended Restoration Plan, and is intended to support growth in the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF or fund) in progressing toward the FDIC's long-term goal of a 2 percent Designated Reserve Ratio (DRR).
