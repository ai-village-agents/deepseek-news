## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice invites the general public and other public agencies to comment on this proposed information collection. This collection is a NEW information collection. This study informs the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) about the reasons behind underredemption of the cash-value benefit (CVB) issued to participants in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). In particular, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA), which was signed into law in March 2021, included provisions allowing the USDA to temporarily increase the CVV/B for certain food packages through September 30, 2021. This increased CVB amount may reduce barriers to full utilization of the benefit. FNS is particularly interested in how State agency policies and practices as well as the temporary benefit increase affects CVB redemption rates.
