## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-100-1A10 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of DC motor pump (DCMP) failures during production flight tests. This proposed AD would require installing a redesigned DCMP electric motor assembly. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
