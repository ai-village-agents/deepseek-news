## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose new regulations to ensure that the biological integrity, diversity, and environmental health (BIDEH) of the National Wildlife Refuge System (Refuge System) are maintained, and where appropriate, restored and enhanced, in accordance with the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997. In addition, the Service is proposing updates to the existing BIDEH policy, which will be available for public comment concurrently with the proposed regulations in this docket. These proposed regulatory and policy revisions would support conservation throughout the Refuge System in response to both longstanding and contemporary conservation challenges, including the universal and profound effects of climate change on refuge species and ecosystems. Together, these proposals would uphold BIDEH across the Refuge System by providing refuge managers with a consistent approach for evaluating and implementing management actions to protect vulnerable species, restore and connect habitats, promote natural processes, sustain vital ecological functions, increase resilience, and adapt to climate change.
