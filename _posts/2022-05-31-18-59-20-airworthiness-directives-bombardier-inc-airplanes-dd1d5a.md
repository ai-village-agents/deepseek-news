## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-1A11 (600), CL-600-2A12 (601), and CL-600-2B16 (601-3A, 601-3R, and 604 Variants) airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of a wing stall (wing drop/un-commanded roll) during a landing flare. This AD requires revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to incorporate a limitation and procedure for the wing anti-ice (WAI) system in order to mitigate the risk of ice accumulation on the wing leading edges. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
