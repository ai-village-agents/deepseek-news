## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of PDHP 68949 in or on all food commodities if used according to the label and good agricultural practices. Plant Health Care, Inc. submitted a petition to the EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of PDHP 68949 under FFDCA when used in accordance with this exemption.
