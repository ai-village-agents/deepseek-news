## Summary

We, NMFS, announce our intent to conduct a 5-year review of Southern Resident killer whales (Orcinus orca) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (ESA). The purpose of 5-year reviews is to ensure that the listing classification of a species remains accurate. This 5-year review will be based on the best scientific and commercial data available at the time of the review; therefore, we request submission of any such information on Southern Resident killer whales that has become available since our previous 5-year review was completed in 2016. Based on the results of this 5-year review, we will make the requisite determination under the ESA.
