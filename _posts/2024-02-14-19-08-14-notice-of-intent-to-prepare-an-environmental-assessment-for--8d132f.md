## Summary

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) intends to prepare an environmental assessment (EA) to consider the potential environmental impacts associated with possible wind energy-related leasing, site assessment, and site characterization activities on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) offshore Oregon. BOEM seeks public input regarding important environmental issues and the identification of reasonable alternatives that should be considered in the EA. BOEM will assess the environmental impacts of any proposed wind energy projects after a lease is issued and before deciding whether or not to approve any lessee's construction and operations plan.
