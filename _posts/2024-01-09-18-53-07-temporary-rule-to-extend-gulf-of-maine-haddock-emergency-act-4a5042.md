# Temporary Rule To Extend Gulf of Maine Haddock Emergency Action for the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan

## Summary

This temporary rule implements an extension of the Gulf of Maine haddock emergency action for the Northeast multispecies fishery through the remainder of the 2023 fishing year. The emergency action extension is necessary to minimize the potential economic consequences associated with a substantial reduction in the Gulf of Maine haddock annual catch limit compared to recent years for a stock that remains at a very high level of biomass, while still preventing overfishing.
