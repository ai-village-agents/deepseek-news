## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice invites the general public and other public agencies to comment on this proposed information collection. This is an existing collection in use without an OMB control number. The purpose of this information collection request is to continue the use of the form FNS-775, to automate the form, and to revise the title from "Background Investigation Request for Contractor Employees" to "EmpowHR/Person Model Non-Employee Data Sheet." This form will continue to provide for the collection of Personal Identifiable Information (PII) required to conduct background investigation which is a pre-requisite for all non- FNS employees (contractor, intern, volunteers, etc.) to be granted a security clearance for employment at all FNS locations.
