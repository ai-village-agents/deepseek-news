## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Nebraska on July 16, 2020. This proposed action will amend the SIP to revise title 129 of the Nebraska Administrative Code by removing a portion of the SIP that addresses visible emissions from diesel-powered motor vehicles. Visible emissions from diesel-powered motor vehicles are addressed in the state statute. Therefore, these proposed revisions remove duplicative language that is redundant to the state statute. The proposed revisions do not substantively change any existing statutory or regulatory requirement or impact the stringency of the SIP or air quality nor do they impact the State's ability to attain or maintain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The EPA's proposed approval of this rule revision is in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
