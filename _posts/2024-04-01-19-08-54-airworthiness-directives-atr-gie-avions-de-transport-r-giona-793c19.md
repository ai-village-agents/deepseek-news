## Summary

The FAA is correcting an airworthiness directive (AD) that was published in the Federal Register. That AD applies to all ATR-GIE Avions de Transport Regional Model ATR42 and ATR72 airplanes. As published, the effective, incorporation by reference approval, and comment submittal dates specified in the preamble of the preceding correction are incorrect. This document corrects those errors. In all other respects, the original document remains the same.
