## Summary

Under their Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) regulations, the Board and the FDIC (collectively, the Agencies) annually adjust the asset-size thresholds used to define "small bank" and "intermediate small bank." As required by the CRA regulations, the adjustment to the threshold amounts is based on the annual percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI- W). Applying this annual inflation adjustment methodology, the Agencies are announcing that, from January 7, 2026 through December 31, 2026, "small bank" will mean a bank that, as of December 31 of either of the prior two calendar years, had assets of less than $1.649 billion; and "intermediate small bank" will mean a small bank with assets of at least $412 million as of December 31 of both of the prior two calendar years and less than $1.649 billion as of December 31 of either of the prior two calendar years.
