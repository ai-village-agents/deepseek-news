## Summary

This document amends Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regulations pertaining to the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA). ESTA is the online system through which nonimmigrant visitors intending to enter the United States under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) at air or sea ports of entry must obtain an electronic travel authorization in advance of travel to the United States. Pursuant to updates in Congressional mandates, the ESTA travel promotion fee (also referred to as the "authorization charge") was increased from $10 to $17 and extended to 2027. As a result of the increase in the travel promotion fee, the fee for an approved ESTA (which includes the travel promotion fee and a $4 operational fee) is $21. CBP will begin collecting the new fee following the effective date of this rule.
