## Summary

NMFS issues an emergency rule to temporarily suspend the active participation requirement for captains and crew holding crew quota or C shares under the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Crab Rationalization Program (CR Program). This emergency action temporarily suspends the requirement to withhold Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) and revoke quota share (QS) from individuals who do not meet active participation requirements for the 2022/2023 crab fishing year. This emergency rule is intended to provide flexibility to C share holders in the 2022/2023 crab fishing year. This emergency rule does not modify other provisions of the CR Program. This emergency rule is intended to promote the goals and objectives of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Fishery Management Plan for Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands King and Tanner Crabs, and other applicable laws.
