## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all CFM International, S.A. (CFM) LEAP-1A23, LEAP-1A24, LEAP-1A24E1, LEAP- 1A26, LEAP-1A26CJ, LEAP-1A26E1, LEAP-1A29, LEAP-1A29CJ, LEAP-1A30, LEAP-1A32, LEAP-1A33, LEAP-1A33B2, and LEAP-1A35A (LEAP-1A) model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by a manufacturer investigation that revealed that certain high-pressure turbine (HPT) rotor stage 1 disks (HPT stage 1 disks), forward outer seals, and compressor rotor stages 6-10 spools were manufactured from material suspected to have reduced material properties due to iron inclusion. This AD requires replacement of certain HPT stage 1 disks, forward outer seals, and compressor rotor stages 6-10 spools. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
