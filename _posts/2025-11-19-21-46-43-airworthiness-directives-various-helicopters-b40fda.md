## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model H160-B, EC 225LP, AS-365N3, and AS 332L2 helicopters; all Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH Model EC135P1, EC135P2, EC135P2+, EC135P3, EC135T1, EC135T2, EC135T2+, EC135T3, and EC635T2+ helicopters; all Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH Model MBB-BK 117 C-2, MBB-BK 117 D-2, and MBB-BK 117 D-3 helicopters; and all Leonardo S.p.A. Model AB139, AW109SP, AW139, AW169, and AW189 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by reports that certain rescue hoist assemblies may have been equipped with a non- conforming overload clutch assembly. This proposed AD would require replacing each affected rescue hoist assembly with a serviceable rescue hoist assembly. This proposed AD would also prohibit installing an affected rescue hoist assembly unless certain requirements are met. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
