## Summary

This regulation establishes time-limited tolerances for residues of the insecticide flupyradifurone including its degradates and metabolites in or on sugarcane, cane and sugarcane, molasses. This action is associated with the utilization of a crisis exemption under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) authorizing use of the pesticide on sugarcane. This regulation establishes a maximum permissible level for residues of flupyradifurone in or on these commodities. The time-limited tolerances expire on December 31, 2023.
