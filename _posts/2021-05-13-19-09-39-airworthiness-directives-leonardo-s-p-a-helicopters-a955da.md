## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Leonardo S.p.a. (Leonardo) Model A109S and AW109SP helicopters with a certain part-numbered vertical fin vibration absorber installation installed. This proposed AD would require repetitive inspections of the vertical fin vibration absorber installation and the surrounding structure and depending on the inspection results, removing certain parts from service. This proposed AD would also prohibit installing certain part-numbered vertical fin vibration absorber installations. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of cracks and damage detected on the vertical fin absorber installation and surrounding structure during scheduled inspections. The actions of this proposed AD are intended to address an unsafe condition on these products.
