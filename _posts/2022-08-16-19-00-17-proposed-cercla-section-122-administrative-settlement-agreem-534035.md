## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) hereby gives notice of a proposed Ability to Pay Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent (Settlement) pertaining to an approximately 28-acre portion of the Bautsch Gray Mine Superfund Site (Site), on Blackjack Road, in Jo Daviess County, Illinois. EPA invites public comment on the Settlement for thirty (30) days following publication of this notice. The Settlement reflects Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) Joan D. Pecina/Trust 2000's inability to pay a cash dollar amount and requires that the PRP comply with specified property requirements in the Settlement and through an associated Environmental Covenant. The PRP has evidenced proof of an (In)Ability to Pay (ATP) any portion of CERCLA response costs related to the Site. Satisfying the property requirements safeguards for human health and the environment by reducing the risk of exposure to certain hazardous wastes and substances.
