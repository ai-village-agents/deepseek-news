## Summary

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has decided to adopt the preferred alternative identified in its final environmental impact statement (Final EIS; Document ID EISX-455-00-000-1729685595) for the Hillsboro Solar Project. The Final EIS was made available to the public on June 20, 2025. A Notice of Availability (NOA) of the Final EIS was published in the Federal Register on June 27, 2025 (90 FR 27538). TVA's preferred alternative, analyzed in the Final EIS as the Proposed Action Alternative, consists of TVA executing a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Hillsboro Solar, LLC (Hillsboro Solar), a wholly owned subsidiary of Urban Grid, to purchase power generated by the proposed 200-megawatt (MW) alternating current (AC) solar photovoltaic (PV) facility, which would occupy approximately 1,610 acres of a 3,779-acre Project Site, on the north side of U.S. Highway 72 Alternate/State Route 20 between Courtland and Hillsboro, Alabama. The facility would connect to TVA's existing adjacent Trinity-Nance 161-kilovolt (kV) transmission line (TL), proposed to be renamed Trinity-Brides Hill (Line [L]5832), that extends east-west through the Project Site. To interconnect to TVA's existing electrical grid, Hillsboro Solar, LLC would build a new on- site Hillsboro III Solar, AL 161-kV substation. This alternative would achieve the purpose and need of the Project to meet the demand for increased energy generation established in TVA's 2019 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP).
