## Summary

The MDA is issuing this notice of intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to assess the potential environmental impacts associated with an Enhanced Integrated Air and Missile Defense (EIAMD) system for the defense of Guam. The EIS will be prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969; the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA; MDA's NEPA Implementing Procedures; U.S. Department of the Army's (Army) NEPA Implementing Procedures; U.S. Department of the Navy's (DoN) Environmental Readiness Program; U.S. Department of the Air Force's (DAF) Environmental Impact Analysis Process; and Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) NEPA Policies and Procedures. The EIS will evaluate the potential environmental impacts from the proposed deployment and operation of missile defense radars and sensors, missile interceptor launchers, and command and control systems; construction and operation of associated support facilities and infrastructure; and management of associated airspace (hereafter called "Proposed Action"). The MDA is initiating a public scoping period to receive comments on the scope of the EIS including identification of potential alternatives, information, and analyses relevant to the Proposed Action, and the Proposed Action's potential to affect historic properties pursuant to section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966.
