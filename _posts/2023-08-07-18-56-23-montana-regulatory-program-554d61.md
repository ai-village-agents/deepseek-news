## Summary

We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), are announcing receipt of a proposed amendment to the Montana regulatory program (hereinafter, the Montana program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). During the 2023 legislative session, the Montana legislature passed House Bill 576 (HB 576), amending the Montana Strip and Underground Mine Reclamation Act as well as the Montana Code Annotated (MCA). Accordingly, Montana submitted this proposed amendment to OSMRE on its own initiative. Montana's proposal amends the definition of "Material Damage," by changing the requirements for what is considered "Material Damage" to the hydrologic balance. Montana's proposal also amends permit requirements for mine operations related to hydrologic information. The amendment removes the requirement that a permit applicant must submit hydrologic information to the Montana Depart of Environmental Quality (DEQ) before DEQ approves the permit application. Lastly, HB 576 adds four contingencies to the proposed amendments of the MCA: a severability clause, a contingent voidness clause, an effective date clause, and a retroactive applicability clause. This document gives the times and locations that the Montana program and this proposed amendment to the program are available for your inspection, the comment period during which you may submit written comments on the amendment, and the procedures that we will follow for the public hearing, if one is requested.
