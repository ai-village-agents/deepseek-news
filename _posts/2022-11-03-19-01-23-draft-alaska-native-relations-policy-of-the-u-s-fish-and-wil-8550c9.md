## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are making available for public comment our draft Alaska Native Relations policy. The purpose of this policy is to build on the Service's existing Native American policy by providing additional clarity for employees on the Service's relationships with Tribes in Alaska, Alaska Native organizations, and Alaska Native corporations. We invite comments on the draft policy from State and Federal government agencies, federally recognized Tribal governments, inter-Tribal organizations, non- federally recognized Tribal governments, Alaska Native corporations, and the general public.
