## Summary

In this document, the Commission seeks comment on the state of the Next Generation Television ("Next Gen TV" or "ATSC 3.0") transition and on the scheduled sunsets of two rules adopted in the First Next Gen TV Report and Order. First, the Commission reviews and seeks comment on the progress of Next Gen TV broadcasters' voluntary, market-driven deployment of ATSC 3.0 service and the current state of the ATSC 3.0 marketplace, including whether holders of essential patents for the ATSC 3.0 standards are licensing such patents on reasonable and non-discriminatory (RAND) terms. Second, the Commission seeks comment on the scheduled 2023 sunset of the rule requiring that a Next Gen TV station's ATSC 1.0 simulcast primary video programming stream be "substantially similar" to its 3.0 primary programming stream. Third, the Commission seeks comment on the scheduled 2023 sunset of the requirement that a Next Gen TV station comply with the ATSC A/322 standard.
