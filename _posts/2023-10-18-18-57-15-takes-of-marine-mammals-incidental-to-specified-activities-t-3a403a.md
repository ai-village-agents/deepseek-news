## Summary

NMFS received a request from the United States National Science Foundation (NSF) for the renewal of their currently active incidental harassment authorization (IHA) (hereinafter, the "initial IHA") to take marine mammals incidental to a geophysical survey in the Ross Sea, Antarctica because NSF's activities will not be completed prior to the IHA's expiration. Pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act, prior to issuing the currently active IHA, NMFS requested comments on both the proposed IHA and the potential for renewing the initial authorization if certain requirements were satisfied. The renewal requirements have been satisfied, and NMFS is now providing an additional 15-day comment period to allow for any additional comments on the proposed renewal not previously provided during the initial 30- day comment period.
