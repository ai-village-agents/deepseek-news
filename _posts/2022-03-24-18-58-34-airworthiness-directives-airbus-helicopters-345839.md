## Summary

The FAA is removing Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-03-16, which applied to all Airbus Helicopters Model AS350B, AS350B1, AS350B2, AS350B3, AS350BA, AS350D, AS355E, AS355F, AS355F1, AS355F2, AS355N, and AS355NP helicopters. AD 2021-03-16 required inspecting each sliding door and replacing the upper rail or front roller or removing the front roller from service if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-03-16, inspection results and further investigation have confirmed that the in-flight loss of a sliding door, which prompted AD 2021-03-16, was an isolated case resulting from incorrect operation and maintenance error. Therefore, the FAA has determined that no unsafe condition is likely to exist or develop on the sliding doors on other helicopters in the fleet. Accordingly, AD 2021-03-16 is removed.
