## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of the draft guidance entitled "Pulse Oximeters for Medical Purposes--Non-Clinical and Clinical Performance Testing, Labeling, and Premarket Submission Recommendations." This draft guidance document, when finalized, will provide recommendations regarding non-clinical and clinical performance testing of certain pulse oximeters for medical purposes, including devices with a pulse oximeter function that estimates the amount of oxygen in arterial blood and pulse rate. These recommendations are being proposed based in part on concerns that the accuracy of pulse oximeters can be affected by, among other factors, a person's skin pigmentation. The recommendations are being proposed to inform the performance evaluation for these devices, to support premarket submissions, regardless of submission type, and to promote consistency and facilitate efficient review of these submissions. Among other topics, the draft guidance also proposes recommendations for labeling, which are intended to promote the safe and effective use of pulse oximeters and help users understand the benefits and risks associated with the use of the device. This draft guidance is not final nor is it for implementation at this time.
