## Summary

MSHA is proposing to revise 30 CFR part 57 by removing outdated requirements for miners' exposures to diesel particulate matter (DPM) in underground metal and nonmetal mines (MNM). These revisions would streamline the requirements for DPM for underground MNM mine operators while maintaining the same level of protection for miners.
