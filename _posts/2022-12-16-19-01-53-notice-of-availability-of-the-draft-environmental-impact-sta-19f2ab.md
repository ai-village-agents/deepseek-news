## Summary

BOEM announces the availability of the draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) for the construction and operations plan (COP) submitted by Virginia Electric and Power Company, doing business as Dominion Energy Virginia (Dominion Energy), for its proposed Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Commercial Project (CVOW Project or Project). The DEIS analyzes the potential environmental impacts of the Project as described in the COP (the proposed action) and alternatives to the proposed action, including no action. This notice of availability announces the start of the public review and comment period, as well as the dates and times for virtual public hearings on the DEIS. After the comment period and public hearings, BOEM will publish a final environmental impact statement (FEIS) addressing comments received on the DEIS. The FEIS will inform BOEM's decision whether to approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove the Dominion Energy COP for the CVOW Project.
