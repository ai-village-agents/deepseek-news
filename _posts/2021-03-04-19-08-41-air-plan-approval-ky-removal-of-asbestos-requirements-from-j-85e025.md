# Air Plan Approval; KY; Removal of Asbestos Requirements From Jefferson County Regulations

## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to correct the erroneous incorporation of asbestos National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) requirements into the Jefferson County portion of the Kentucky State Implementation Plan (SIP). The continued presence of the asbestos requirements in the Jefferson County portion of the Kentucky SIP is inappropriate and potentially confusing and thus problematic for affected sources, the Commonwealth, local agencies, and EPA. EPA is proposing to remove the asbestos requirements because these requirements are not related to the attainment and maintenance of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and are therefore unrelated to the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act") requirements for SIPs.
