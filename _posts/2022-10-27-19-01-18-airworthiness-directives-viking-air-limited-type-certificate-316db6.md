## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 96- 12-11, which applies to all Canadair Model CL-215-1A10 airplanes. AD 96-12-11 requires repetitive inspections to detect discrepancies of the microswitches fitted at the water door actuator; replacement of any discrepant microswitch; and modification of the water door actuator switches, which terminates the repetitive inspections. Since the FAA issued AD 96-12-11, it has determined that the corrective actions of that AD have not been effective at mitigating the risk of uncommanded opening of the water doors. This proposed AD would continue to require the modification of the water door actuator switches. This proposed AD would also require modification of the water door solenoid valve common grounds, add airplanes to the applicability, and prohibit installing certain water door solenoid valve selector assemblies. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
