## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain General Electric Company (GE) Model GEnx-1B and GEnx-2B engines. This AD was prompted by a manufacturer investigation that revealed that certain stages 6-10 compressor rotor spools and forward seals were manufactured from powder metal material suspected to contain iron inclusion. This AD requires the replacement of the affected stages 6-10 compressor rotor spools and forward seals. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
