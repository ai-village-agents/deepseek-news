## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to partially approve and partially disapprove revisions to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Missouri on February 17, 2022. In its submission, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MoDNR) requested that revisions to a 2016 Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) for controlling sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) emissions at the Lake Road power plant (hereinafter referred to as "2016 AOC") be approved in the SIP. This final action amends the SIP to establish more stringent fuel oil sulfur content limits, remove SO<INF>2</INF> emission limits that are no longer needed due to the strengthened fuel oil sulfur requirements, and streamline reporting requirements. The approved SIP changes meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA). This final action also disapproves a new provision in the AOC that would potentially allow Lake Road to exceed the fuel oil sulfur content limits on a temporary basis.
