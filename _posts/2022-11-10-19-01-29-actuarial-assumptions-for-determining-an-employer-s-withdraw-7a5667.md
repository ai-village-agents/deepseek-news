## Summary

The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is extending the comment period for a proposed rule that would provide interest rate assumptions that may be used by a plan actuary in determining a withdrawing employer's liability under a multiemployer plan. PBGC published the proposed rule in the Federal Register on October 14, 2022, with a comment period that was scheduled to end on November 14, 2022. Since the proposed rule was published, PBGC has received a request from a group of interested parties for PBGC to extend the comment period to provide a total of at least 60 days from October 14, 2022, for them to submit comments on the proposal. In response to this request, PBGC is extending the comment period through December 13, 2022.
