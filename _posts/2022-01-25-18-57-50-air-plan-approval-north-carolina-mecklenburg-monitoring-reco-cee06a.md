## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision to the Mecklenburg County portion of the North Carolina SIP, hereinafter referred to as the Mecklenburg Local Implementation Plan (LIP). The revision was submitted by the State of North Carolina, through the North Carolina Division of Air Quality (NCDAQ), on behalf of Mecklenburg County Air Quality (MCAQ) via a letter dated April 24, 2020, and was received by EPA on June 19, 2020. The revision updates several Mecklenburg County Air Pollution Control Ordinance (MCAPCO) rules and adds three new rules for incorporation into the LIP. These rules cover general recordkeeping, monitoring, and reporting requirements. EPA is approving these changes pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act).
