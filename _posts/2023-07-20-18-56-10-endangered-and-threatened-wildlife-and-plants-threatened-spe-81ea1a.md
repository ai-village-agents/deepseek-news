## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), determine threatened species status under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended, for the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl (Glaucidium brasilianum cactorum), a bird subspecies found in Mexico, southern Arizona, and southern Texas. This rule adds the subspecies to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. We also finalize a rule under the authority of section 4(d) of the Act that provides measures that are necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation of this subspecies. We concluded that designation of critical habitat is prudent and determinable at this time. Critical habitat will be proposed in a separate rule-making.
