## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled the Collaborating Center for Questionnaire Design and Evaluation Research (CCQDER). This Generic Clearance request allows CDC to conduct cognitive testing activities, and includes a general questionnaire for development, pre-testing, and measurement-error reduction activities to be carried out in 2022-2025.
