## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission or we) revises its rules governing spectrum sharing among a new generation of broadband satellite constellations to promote market entry, regulatory certainty, and spectrum efficiency. The Commission adopts rules clarifying protection obligations between non- geostationary satellite orbit, fixed-satellite service (NGSO FSS) systems authorized through different processing rounds, subjects those protections to a sunset period, and requires all NGSO FSS operators licensed or granted market access in the United States to coordinate with each other in good faith.
