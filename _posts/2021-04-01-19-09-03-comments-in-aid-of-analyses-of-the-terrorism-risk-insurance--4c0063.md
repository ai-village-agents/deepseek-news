## Summary

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA) created the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIP or Program) to address disruptions in the market for terrorism risk insurance, to help ensure the continued availability and affordability of commercial property and casualty insurance for terrorism risk, and to allow for the private markets to stabilize and build insurance capacity to absorb any future losses for terrorism events. The Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary) administers the Program, with the assistance of the Federal Insurance Office (FIO). Treasury requests comments from interested parties concerning the issues that FIO will be analyzing in connection with its next report concerning the participation of small insurers in the Program, including any competitive challenges such insurers face in the terrorism risk insurance marketplace.
