## Summary

The Department of Commerce (Commerce) determines that the two mandatory respondents, Guangdong New Shichu Import and Export Company Limited (New Shichu) and KaiPing Dawn Plumbing Products, Inc. (KaiPing), have not established their eligibility for a separate rate and are part of the China-wide entity. We also continue to assign the China-wide rate to an additional nine companies, because we determine that they are not eligible for a separate rate. Finally, we continue to grant a separate rate to Jiangmen New Star Hi-Tech Enterprise Ltd. (New Star), which demonstrated eligibility for separate rate status but was not selected for individual examination. The period of review (POR) is April 1, 2018 through March 31, 2019.
