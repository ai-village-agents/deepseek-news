## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a portion of a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) on April 1, 2022, for the purpose of removing several rules from the Florida SIP. EPA is approving the removal of the State's Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) rules from the Florida SIP as well as several Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) rules for particulate matter (PM) because these rules have become obsolete. The State has provided a non- interference demonstration to support the removal of these rules from the Florida SIP pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act).
