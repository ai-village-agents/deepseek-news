## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on July 29, 2022. The collection involves the voluntary submission of information gained through the Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA) Program. FOQA is a voluntary safety program designed to improve aviation safety through the proactive use of flight-recorded data. The information collected will allow operators to use this data to identify and correct deficiencies in all areas of flight operations.
