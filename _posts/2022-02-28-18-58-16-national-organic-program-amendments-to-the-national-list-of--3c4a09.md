## Summary

This final rule amends the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) organic regulations to implement recommendations from the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB). The rule prohibits fourteen nonorganic ingredients, which are currently allowed in the manufacture of organic processed products. The rule also prohibits two substances (vitamin B<INF>1</INF> and procaine), which are currently allowed in organic crop and livestock production. Finally, the rule renews an allowance for two substances (oxytocin and sucrose octanoate esters) in organic production.
