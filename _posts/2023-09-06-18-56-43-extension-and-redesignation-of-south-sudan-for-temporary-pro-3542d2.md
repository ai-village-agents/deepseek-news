## Summary

Through this notice, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announces that the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) is extending the designation of South Sudan for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 18 months, beginning on November 4, 2023, and ending on May 3, 2025. This extension allows existing TPS beneficiaries to retain TPS through May 3, 2025, so long as they otherwise continue to meet the eligibility requirements for TPS. Existing TPS beneficiaries who wish to extend their status through May 3, 2025, must re-register during the 60-day re-registration period described in this notice. The Secretary is also redesignating South Sudan for TPS. The redesignation of South Sudan allows additional South Sudanese nationals (and individuals having no nationality who last habitually resided in South Sudan) who have been continuously residing in the United States since September 4, 2023, to apply for TPS for the first time during the initial registration period described under the redesignation information in this notice. In addition to demonstrating continuous residence in the United States since September 4, 2023, and meeting other eligibility criteria, initial applicants for TPS under this designation must demonstrate that they have been continuously physically present in the United States since November 4, 2023, the effective date of this redesignation of South Sudan for TPS.
