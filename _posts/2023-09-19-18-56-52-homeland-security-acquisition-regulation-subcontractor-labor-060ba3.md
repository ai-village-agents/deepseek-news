## Summary

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is withdrawing its proposed rule titled Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) Subcontractor Labor Hour Rates Under Time and Materials Contracts (HSAR Case 2010-001) and providing this notice of cancellation. The notice of proposed rulemaking proposed to amend the Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) parts 3016 and 3052 to require DHS contracts for time and material or labor hours (T&M/LH) to include separate labor hour rates for subcontractors and a description of the method that will be used to record and bill for labor hours for both contractors and subcontractors. DHS is withdrawing this proposed rule because of differing agency priorities and the staleness of the public comments. DHS will not take any further action on this proposal.
