## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) and accompanying environmental assessment (EA) for an exemption request from ProTechnics, a division of Core Laboratories LP (ProTechnics), byproduct material license no. 42-26928-01, for alternate abandonment of an irretrievable sealed source in a Gulf of Mexico oil and gas well. Based on the analysis in the EA, the NRC staff has concluded that there would be no significant impacts on the quality of the human environment from ProTechnics' proposed exemption request and therefore, a FONSI is appropriate.
