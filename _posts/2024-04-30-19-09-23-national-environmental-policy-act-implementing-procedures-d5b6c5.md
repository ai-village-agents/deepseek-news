## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE or the Department) is revising its National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) implementing procedures (regulations) to add a categorical exclusion for certain energy storage systems and revise categorical exclusions for upgrading and rebuilding powerlines and for solar photovoltaic systems, as well as to make conforming changes to related sections of DOE's NEPA regulations. These changes will help ensure that DOE conducts an appropriate and efficient environmental review of proposed projects that normally do not result in significant environmental impacts.
