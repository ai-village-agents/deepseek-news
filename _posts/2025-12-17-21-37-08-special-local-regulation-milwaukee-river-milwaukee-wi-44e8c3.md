## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to update special local regulations (SLR) for certain navigable waters of the Milwaukee River. The SLR update is needed to make the regulations more accurate and to continue to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards created by a boat race. This proposed rulemaking would delete an outdated SLR for the Milwaukee Open Water Swim and update the Milwaukee River Challenge to change the date from "1 day; the third Saturday of September." to "1 day; on or around early October." We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
