## Summary

On August 8, 2023, DHS issued an interim final rule which amended the regulations to authorize ICE to serve bond-related notices to obligors electronically. The rule allowed DHS to electronically serve demand and other immigration bond notices for delivery, order of supervision, or voluntary departure bonds to obligors who consent to electronic service. DHS is now issuing this final rule that introduces no substantive changes from the interim final rule.
