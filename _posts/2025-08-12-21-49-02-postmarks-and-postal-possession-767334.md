## Summary

The United States Postal Service seeks comment on a proposed addition to the Mailing Standards of the United States Postal Service, Domestic Mail Manual (DMM). Specifically, the Postal Service proposes to add Section 608.11, "Postmarks and Postal Possession." This Section will serve multiple purposes. It will define the postmark, will identify the types of Postal Service markings that qualify as postmarks, and will describe the circumstances under which those markings are applied. This Section will also explain that, while the presence of a postmark on a mailpiece confirms that the Postal Service was in possession of the mailpiece on the date of the postmark's inscription, the postmark date does not inherently or necessarily align with the date on which the Postal Service first accepted possession of a mailpiece. In addition, this Section will advise customers of the options available if they want evidence of the exact date on which the Postal Service first accepted possession of their mailpiece. The proposed DMM addition does not signal and would not effect a change in postmarking procedures; postmarks will continue to be applied to Single-Piece First Class Mail pieces, both letter-shaped and flat- shaped, in the same manner and to the same extent as before.
