## Summary

This regulation extends time-limited tolerances for residues of the pesticides clothianidin, methyl bromide, and triclopyr in or on various commodities, as identified in this document. These actions are in response to EPA's granting of emergency exemptions under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) authorizing use of these pesticides. In addition, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) requires EPA to establish a time-limited tolerance or exemption from the requirement for a tolerance for pesticide chemical residues in food that will result from the use of a pesticide under an emergency exemption granted by EPA. Additionally, EPA is removing time-limited tolerances for flonicamid on prickly pear, fruit and pads at 1.5 ppm because this exemption will not be renewed, and the tolerances will expire by the effective date of this rule. EPA is also making non- substantive administrative revisions to the tolerance listings for methyl bromide to update the commodity terminology.
