## Summary

This proposed rule would update the prospective payment rates, the outlier threshold, and the wage index for Medicare inpatient hospital services provided by Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities (IPF), which include psychiatric hospitals and excluded psychiatric units of an acute care hospital or critical access hospital. This proposed rule would also establish a permanent mitigation policy to smooth the impact of year-to-year changes in IPF payments related to decreases in the IPF wage index. In addition, this proposed rule includes a request for comment on the results of the data analysis of the IPF Prospective Payment System adjustments. The proposed changes in this rule would be effective for IPF discharges occurring during the Fiscal Year (FY) beginning October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023 (FY 2023). Lastly, this proposed rule requests information on Measuring Equity and Healthcare Quality Disparities Across CMS Quality Programs.
