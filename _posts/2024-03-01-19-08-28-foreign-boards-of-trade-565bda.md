## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC or Commission) is proposing to amend its regulations to permit a foreign board of trade (FBOT) registered with the Commission to provide direct access to its electronic trading and order matching system to an identified member or other participant located in the United States and registered with the Commission as an introducing broker (IB) for submission of customer orders to the FBOT's trading system for execution. The Commission is also proposing to establish a procedure for an FBOT to request revocation of its registration, and to remove certain outdated references to "existing no-action relief."
