## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce findings that nine species are not warranted for listing as endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). After a thorough review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that it is not warranted at this time to list the Alexander Archipelago wolf (Canis lupus ligoni), Chihuahua catfish (Ictalurus sp. 1), Cooper's cave amphipod (Stygobromus cooperi), Georgia blind salamander (Eurycea wallacei), minute cave amphipod (Stygobromus parvus), Morrison's cave amphipod (Stygobromus morrisoni), narrow-foot hygrotus diving beetle (Hygrotus diversipes), pristine crayfish (Cambarus pristinus), and Tennessee heelsplitter (Lasmigona holstonia). However, we ask the public to submit to us at any time any new information relevant to the status of any of the species mentioned above or their habitats.
