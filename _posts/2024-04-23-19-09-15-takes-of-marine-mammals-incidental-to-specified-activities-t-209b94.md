## Summary

NMFS has received a request from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) for the reissuance of a previously issued incidental harassment authorization (IHA) with the only change being effective dates. The initial IHA authorized take of 10 species of marine mammals, by Level B harassment only, incidental to construction activities associated with the Port of Nome Modification Project in Nome, Alaska. The project has been delayed by 1 year and none of the work covered in the initial IHA has been conducted. The initial IHA was effective from May 1, 2024 through April 30, 2025. USACE has requested reissuance with new effective dates of May 1, 2025 through April 30, 2026. The scope of the activities and anticipated effects remain the same, authorized take numbers are not changed, and the required mitigation, monitoring, and reporting remains the same as included in the initial IHA. NMFS is, therefore, issuing a second identical IHA to cover the incidental take analyzed and authorized in the initial IHA.
