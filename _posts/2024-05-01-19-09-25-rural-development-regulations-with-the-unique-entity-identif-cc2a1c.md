## Summary

The Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBCS), Rural Housing Service (RHS), and Rural Utilities Services (RUS), agencies in the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development (RD) Mission area, are issuing a final rule to update RD program regulations by removing references to the Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) numbers and replacing them with the new Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) as the primary means of identifying entities registered for Federal awards government-wide in the System for Award Management (SAM).
