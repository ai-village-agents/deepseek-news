The CTA requires certain entities to report to FinCEN identifying information associated with the entities themselves, their beneficial owners, and their company applicants (together, beneficial ownership information or BOI). The CTA also authorizes FinCEN to disclose BOI to authorized recipients, subject to strict protocols on security and confidentiality.
