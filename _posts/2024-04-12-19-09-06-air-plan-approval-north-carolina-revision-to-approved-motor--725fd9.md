## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the North Carolina State Implementation Plan (SIP), submitted by the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ), Division of Air Quality, on December 19, 2022. The revision seeks to update the 2026 on-road and nonroad emissions inventories and safety margins, allocate a portion of the newly available 2026 safety margins in the 2008 8-hour Ozone Maintenance Plan to the 2026 nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) motor vehicle emissions budgets ("budgets") for the North Carolina portion of the Charlotte-Rock Hill, NC-SC bi-state Area (hereinafter referred to as the "North Carolina portion of the Charlotte Maintenance Area") to accommodate updates from the EPA Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator (MOVES3) model. The SIP revision also revises the current 2026 budgets based on the MOVES3 updates and recalculates new available safety margins. NCDEQ's December 19, 2022, submission supplements the revised 2008 8-hour Ozone Maintenance Plan submitted by NCDEQ on July 16, 2020, and approved by EPA on August 25, 2021. EPA is proposing to approve North Carolina's December 19, 2022, SIP revision and deem the budgets adequate for transportation conformity purposes because they meet the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.
