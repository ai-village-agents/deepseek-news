## Summary

Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on December 31, 2024, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of Spanx, LLC of Atlanta, Georgia. A supplement to the complaint was filed on January 22, 2025. The complaint, as supplemented, alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain shapewear garments by reason of the infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 9,179,713 ("the '713 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 9,930,916 ("the '916 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 10,455,866 ("the '866 patent"); U.S. Patent No. D707,920 ("the '920 patent"); U.S. Patent No. D796,780 ("the '780 patent"); and U.S. Patent No. D796,784 ("the '784 patent"). The complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists or is in the process of being established as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The complainant requests that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a general exclusion order, or in the alternative a limited exclusion order, and cease and desist orders.
