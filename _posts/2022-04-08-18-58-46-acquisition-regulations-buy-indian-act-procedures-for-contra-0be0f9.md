## Summary

This final rule revises the Department of the Interior's regulations implementing the Buy Indian Act, which provides the Department of Interior (DOI) with authority to set aside procurement contracts for Indian-owned and controlled businesses. These revisions eliminate barriers to Indian Economic Enterprises from competing on certain construction contracts, expand Indian Economic Enterprises' ability to subcontract construction work consistent with other socio- economic set-aside programs, and give greater preference to Indian Economic Enterprises when a deviation from the Buy Indian Act is necessary, among other updates.
