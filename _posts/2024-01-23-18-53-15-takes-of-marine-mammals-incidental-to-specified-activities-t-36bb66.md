## Summary

In accordance with the regulations implementing the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), as amended, NMFS hereby promulgates regulations to govern the incidental taking of marine mammals incidental to the Virginia Electric and Power Company, doing business as Dominion Energy Virginia (Dominion Energy), construction of the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Commercial (CVOW-C) Project (hereafter, the CVOW-C Project or the Project) in Federal and State waters offshore of Virginia, specifically within the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) Commercial Lease of Submerged Lands for Renewable Energy Development on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lease Area OCS-A 0483 (Lease Area) and along export cable routes to sea-to-shore transition points (collectively referred to as the "Project Area"), over the course of 5 years (February 5, 2024 through February 4, 2029). These regulations, which allow for the issuance of a Letter of Authorization (LOA) for the incidental take of marine mammals during construction- related activities within the Project Area during the effective dates of the regulations, prescribe the permissible methods of taking and other means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact on marine mammal species or stocks and their habitat, as well as requirements pertaining to the monitoring and reporting of such taking.
