## Summary

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services seeks an update to the existing data collection for the Annual Survey of Refugees. The Annual Survey of Refugees is a yearly sample survey of refugee households entering the U.S. in the previous 5 fiscal years. The requested update is based upon results of a multi-year effort in instrument redesign and field testing. ACF estimates the proposed changes will increase response burden from 48 to 50 minutes per respondent.
