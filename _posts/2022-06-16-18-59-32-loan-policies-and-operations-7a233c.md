## Summary

The purpose of the proposed rule is to increase direct lender associations' Young, Beginning, and Small farmer and rancher (YBS) activity and reinforce the supervisory responsibilities of the funding banks, authorized by section 4.19 of the Farm Credit Act. The proposed rule requires direct lender associations to adopt an independent strategic plan for their YBS program. The direct lender association's funding bank will approve each YBS strategic plan, annually. The direct lender association's YBS strategic plan must contain specific elements that will be evaluated as part of a rating system to measure year-over- year internal progress. The rating system will enable the Farm Credit Administration (FCA) to compare the success of the direct lender association's extension of credit and services to the YBS borrowing population to its peers both within and outside its bank district.
