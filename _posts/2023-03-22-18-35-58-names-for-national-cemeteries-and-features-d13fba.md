## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes to remove its regulation concerning the naming of cemeteries and features. VA is proposing this action because, after reviewing internal policy and processes, VA determined this regulation is obsolete and unnecessary. When VA promulgated this regulation, VA's cemetery naming activities were supported by statute and served a purely administrative function that did not change existing law or policy and did not affect individual rights or obligations. The activities therefore did not require a regulation to effectuate. However, now that the regulation is in effect, removing it would change existing policy, which requires a rulemaking. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs (the Secretary) has authority for naming Department property and has delegated in regulation the authority for naming features within national cemeteries to the Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs, who is the head of VA's National Cemetery Administration. Therefore, this action is under the authority of the National Cemetery Administration.
