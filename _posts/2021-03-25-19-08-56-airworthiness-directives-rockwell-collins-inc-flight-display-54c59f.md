## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) AD 2019- 12-09 for certain Rockwell Collins, Inc. (Rockwell Collins) FDSA-6500 flight display system applications installed on airplanes. AD 2019-12- 09 imposed operating limitations on the traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS). AD 2019-12-09 was prompted by conflict between the TCAS display indications and aural alerts that may occur during a resolution advisory (RA) scenario. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2019-12- 09 until a software upgrade is completed. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
