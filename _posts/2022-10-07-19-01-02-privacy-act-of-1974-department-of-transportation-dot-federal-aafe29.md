## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Transportation (DOT) intends to rename, modify and re-issue a DOT Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) system of records notice entitled, "DOT/FAA 852 Suspected Unapproved Parts (SUP) Program." The name of this System of Records Notice (SORN) is being changed to "DOT/ FAA 852 Complaint Investigations System." The modification of this system of records notice (hereafter referred to as "Notice") is appropriate because the FAA has aligned the management and oversight of the SUP program with that of other reports of actual or perceived aviation safety-related issues, alleged violations of criminal, civil and administrative laws and regulations, including aircraft noise and whistleblower complaints, and aviation safety related orders under the regulatory oversight of the FAA. The records include the investigative records created as a result of the variety of complaints and issues reported by the public, as well as by FAA employees and contractors. The records of the complaints are covered by the DOT/FAA 845 Administrators Correspondence Control and Hotline Information System (ACCIS), Administrator's Hotline Information System (AHIS) and Consumer Hotline Information System (CHIS) SORN,\1\ while the investigative records, if any, created as a result of these complaints received under the DOT/FAA 845 SORN, will be covered by this SORN. These investigations and findings are managed using the same FAA policies, information systems, and common processes. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
