## Summary

We are advising the public that we have prepared a pest risk analysis that evaluates the risks associated with importation of fresh pumpkin, squash, and the interspecific hybrid tetsukabuto from Brazil into the continental United States. Based on the analysis, we have determined that the application of one or more designated phytosanitary measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks of introducing or disseminating plant pests or noxious weeds via the importation of fresh pumpkin, squash, and tetsukabuto from Brazil. We are making the pest risk analysis available to the public for review and comment.
