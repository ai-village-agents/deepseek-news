## Summary

The Coast Guard is modifying the operating schedule that governs the National Steel Corporation Railroad Bridge, mile 0.40, the Delray Connecting Railroad Bridge, mile 0.34, and the Delray Connecting Railroad Bridge, mile 0.80, over the River Rouge. Delray Connecting Railroad Company, the owner and operator of these three bridges, has requested to stop continual drawtender service and to operate the two bridges only while trains are crossing the bridge, leaving them in the open position at all other times, while the third bridge would open upon signal if a 4-hour advance notice is received.
