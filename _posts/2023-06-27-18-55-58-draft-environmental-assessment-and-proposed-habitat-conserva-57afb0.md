## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), have received an application from Cardinal Point Wind Farm, LLC for an incidental take permit under the Endangered Species Act, for its Cardinal Point Wind Project (project). If approved, the permit would authorize the incidental take of two endangered species, the Indiana bat and the northern long-eared bat, and two species under federal review, the tricolored bat and little brown bat. The applicant has prepared a habitat conservation plan in support of their application. We also announce the availability of a draft environmental assessment, which has been prepared in response to the permit application in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. We invite comments from the public and Federal, Tribal, State, and local governments.
