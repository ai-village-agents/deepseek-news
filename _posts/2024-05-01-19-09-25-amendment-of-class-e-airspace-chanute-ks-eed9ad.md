## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace at Chanute, KS. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of an airspace review conducted due to the decommissioning of the Chanute very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program. The geographic coordinates of the airport would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database. This action will bring the airspace into compliance with FAA orders and support instrument flight rule (IFR) procedures and operations.
