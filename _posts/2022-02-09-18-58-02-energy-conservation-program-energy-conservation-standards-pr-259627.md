## Summary

On January 21, 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") published a notification of a webinar and availability of a preliminary technical support document for miscellaneous refrigeration products ("MREFs"). The notification announced that a public meeting webinar would be held on February 17, 2022. On January 28, 2022, DOE received a request from the Association of Home Appliance Manufactures ("AHAM") to move the webinar date due to significant scheduling constraints. To accommodate these scheduling issues, DOE is moving the public meeting webinar for MREFs to Monday, March 7, 2022.
