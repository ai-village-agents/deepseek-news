## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the allocation formula for the Sewer Overflow and Stormwater Reuse Municipal Grants Program as required by the Clean Water Act (CWA). EPA is required to establish a formula to allocate proportional shares of the amount appropriated to state entities to fund actions that will help manage combined sewer overflows, sanitary sewer overflows, and stormwater. EPA was directed to develop a formula based on the relevant infrastructure needs submitted in the latest Clean Watersheds Needs Survey (CWNS) along with additional information considered appropriate by the EPA Administrator. A summary of the formula is included in this document. This document reflects EPA's consideration of public comments received in response to its August 4, 2020 Federal Register publication.
