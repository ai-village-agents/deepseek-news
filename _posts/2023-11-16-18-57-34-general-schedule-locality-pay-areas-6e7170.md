## Summary

The Office of Personnel Management is issuing final regulations on behalf of the President's Pay Agent to change the geographic boundaries of General Schedule locality pay areas. The changes in locality pay area definitions under these final regulations will be applicable on the first day of the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2024. The locations that will be included in a locality pay area separate from the Rest of U.S. locality pay area under these final regulations have all met criteria previously recommended by the Federal Salary Council and approved by the Pay Agent for nationwide use in the locality pay program.
