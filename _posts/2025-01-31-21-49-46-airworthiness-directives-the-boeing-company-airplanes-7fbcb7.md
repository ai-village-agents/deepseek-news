## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 767-200, -300, and -400ER series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of multiple engine indicating and crew alerting system messages during potable water servicing after the water leaked onto the electronics equipment cooling air filter. This AD requires installation of hoseducts around the left-side section 43 potable water supply hoses and connections, a potable water system leakage test, and applicable corrective actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
