## Summary

The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), Administration for children and Families (ACF), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), seeks an update to the existing data collection for the form ORR-5: Refugee Data Submission System for Formula Funds Allocations and Service Analysis (OMB#: 0970-0043, expiration 4/30/ 2024) and requests an extension of approval for three years. Minor changes to the form ORR-5 are as proposed in the description section. Since the previous comment period, there are additional minor proposed edits: an additional data element to clarify whether the initial client assessment was completed and a change to spacing in headers to improve data processing. ACF estimates the proposed changes will not increase response burden.
