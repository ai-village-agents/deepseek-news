## Summary

The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act) authorized the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) to establish the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP or Program). This Program provides benefits to certain persons who sustain serious physical injuries or death as a direct result of administration or use of covered countermeasures identified by the Secretary in declarations issued under the PREP Act. In addition, the Secretary may provide death benefits to certain survivors of individuals who died as the direct result of such covered injuries or their health complications. In accordance with 42 CFR 110.41, the Department of Health and Human Services is issuing this notice to inform the public that the CICP is accepting electronic Request for Benefits package submissions through the Injury Compensation Programs web-based portal. Completed Request for Benefits Forms, Letters of Intent, copies of completed Authorization for Use or Disclosure of Health Information forms, medical records, and any supporting documentation for CICP Request for Benefits packages can be submitted electronically at https://injurycompensation.hrsa.gov.
