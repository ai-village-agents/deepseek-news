## Summary

NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for groundfish by vessels using nonpelagic trawl gear in the Red King Crab Savings Subarea of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary because the State of Alaska, Department of Fish and Game did not establish a guideline harvest level fishery for red king crab in the Bristol Bay area for the 2022/2023 fishing year.
