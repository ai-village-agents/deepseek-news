## Summary

Daimler AG (DAG) and Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA) collectively referred to as "DAG-Mercedes-Benz," and Pirelli Tire, LLC (Pirelli), have determined that certain Pirelli P7 Cinturato RUN FLAT radial tires that were installed as original equipment in certain model year (MY) 2018-2019 Mercedes-Benz motor vehicles and also sold as replacement equipment do not fully comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 139, New Pneumatic Radial Tires for Light Vehicles. Pirelli filed a noncompliance report dated February 25, 2019, and later amended it on March 15, 2019, and DAG-Mercedes-Benz filed a noncompliance report dated March 4, 2019. Pirelli subsequently petitioned NHTSA (the "Agency") on March 18, 2019, and DAG-Mercedes- Benz petitioned NHTSA on March 27, 2019, for a decision that the subject noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. This notice announces and explains the denial of DAG-Mercedes- Benz's and Pirelli's petitions.
