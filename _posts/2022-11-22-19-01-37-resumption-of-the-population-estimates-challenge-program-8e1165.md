## Summary

The Bureau of the Census (Census Bureau) is resuming the Population Estimates Challenge Program to provide eligible governmental units the opportunity to file requests for the review of population estimates for 2021 and subsequent years in forthcoming estimates series, beginning with the Vintage 2022 series that is scheduled to be published in 2023. This document lifts the stay of the Population Estimates Challenge Program regulations. This document does not implement revisions to the program or its requirements. The Census Bureau has published a proposed rule elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register announcing the program's current requirements and soliciting comments about how the program might be improved.
