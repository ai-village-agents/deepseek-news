## Summary

On March 20, 2020, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued for public comment a draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for Holtec International's (Holtec's) application to construct and operate a consolidated interim storage facility (CISF) for spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and Greater-Than Class C (GTCC) waste, along with a small quantity of mixed oxide fuel. The public comment period was originally scheduled to close on May 22, 2020. Given recent events associated with the COVID-19 public health emergency, the NRC has decided to extend the public comment period to allow more time for members of the public to develop and submit their comments.
