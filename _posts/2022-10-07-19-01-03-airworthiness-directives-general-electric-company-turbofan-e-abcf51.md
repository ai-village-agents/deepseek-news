## Summary

The FAA is revising a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that applied to all General Electric Company (GE) CF34-8C1, CF34-8C5, CF34-8C5A1, CF34-8C5B1, CF34-8C5A2, CF34-8C5A3, CF34-8E2, CF34-8E2A1, CF34-8E5, CF34-8E5A1, CF34-8E5A2, CF34-8E6, and CF34-8E6A1 model turbofan engines. This action revises the NPRM by updating the service information references and removing the initial and repetitive fluorescent penetrant inspections (FPIs) of the combustion chamber assembly. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive (AD) to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions change the required actions as proposed in the NPRM, the agency is requesting comments on this SNPRM.
