## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for navigable waters of the Rio Grande River. The safety zone is needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards created by cryogenics and structural tests of SpaceX rockets at their Massey's test site. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port, Sector Corpus Christi. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
