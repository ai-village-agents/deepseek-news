## Summary

This request for information provides an opportunity for the public to submit issues that have an impact on Service members and their families where state governments are the primary agents for making positive change. Each year, DoD selects State Policy Priorities for states to consider that represent barriers resulting from the transience and uncertainty of military life, and the public submissions will be considered by DoD in setting those priorities. For example, DoD has asked states to consider remedies to improve school transitions for children in active duty military families to overcome problems with records transfer, class and course placement, qualifying for extra- curricular activities, and fulfilling graduation requirements.
