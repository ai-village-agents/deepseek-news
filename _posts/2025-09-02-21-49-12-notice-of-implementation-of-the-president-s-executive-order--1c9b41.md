## Summary

In order to effectuate the President's Executive Order 14324 of July 30, 2025 (Suspending Duty-Free De Minimis Treatment For All Countries), the Secretary of Homeland Security has determined that appropriate action is needed to ensure collection of applicable duties as well as to modify the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) as set out in the Annex to this notice. Executive Order 14324 suspends the duty-free de minimis exemption otherwise authorized under section 321(a)(2)(C) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, for all covered products, regardless of country of origin, valued at $800 or less, and requires such articles, except articles that are sent to the United States through the international postal network, to be entered using an appropriate entry type in the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) by a party qualified to make entry. Executive Order 14324 also establishes a new duty rate for covered products that are sent to the United States through the international postal network.
