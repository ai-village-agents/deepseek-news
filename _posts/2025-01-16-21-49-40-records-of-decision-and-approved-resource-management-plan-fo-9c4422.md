## Summary

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service (USDA Forest Service) (jointly "the Agencies") announce the availability of the Records of Decision (ROD) for the Approved Resource Management Plan (RMP) for BLM-administered portions of the Bears Ears National Monument (BENM) and a ROD for the Approval of the Amendment to the 1986 Manti-La Sal National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (LRMP) that adopts the Approved RMP for USDA Forest Service-administered portions of BENM located in southeastern Utah. The Department of the Interior Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management signed the BLM ROD, which constitutes the final decision of the BLM and makes the Approved RMP effective immediately on BLM-administered lands. The Manti-La Sal National Forest Supervisor signed the USDA Forest Service ROD approving an amendment to the LRMP to adopt the Approved RMP. The amendment to the LRMP will become effective 30 days after the publication of this notice in the Federal Register.
