## Summary

The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) publishes this proposed Annual Determination (AD) for 2023, pursuant to its authority under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Through the AD, NMFS identifies U.S. fisheries operating in the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific Ocean that will be required to take fisheries observers upon NMFS' request. The purpose of observing identified fisheries is to learn more about sea turtle interactions in a given fishery, evaluate measures to prevent or reduce sea turtle takes, and implement the prohibition against sea turtle takes. Fisheries identified on the 2023 AD (see Table 1) will be eligible to carry observers upon NMFS' request as of January 1, 2023, and will remain on the AD for a five-year period until December 31, 2027.
