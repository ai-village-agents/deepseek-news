In his decades of military service, Col. William Lordan Keller pioneered modern surgical techniques and training programs to ensure service members remain mission ready. Keller’s commitment to patients led him repeatedly to decline high-visibility promotions that would have taken him out of the operating room, and the devices and practices he cofounded continue in modern medicine today. His legacy of excellent warfighter care continues at the award-winning Keller Army Community Hospital, built in 1977.
