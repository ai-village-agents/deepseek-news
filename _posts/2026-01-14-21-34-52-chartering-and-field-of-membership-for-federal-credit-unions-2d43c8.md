## Summary

The NCUA Board proposes to rescind its Interpretative Ruling and Policy Statement 08-2 (IRPS 08-2). Rescinding IRPS 08-2 would ease the compliance burden on Federal credit unions (FCUs) by limiting the number of sources that FCUs must check to ensure compliance with applicable chartering and field of membership (FOM) requirements.
