## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain ATR--GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42-500 and ATR72-212A airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of temporary loss of all display units and the integrated electronic standby instrument (IESI). This AD requires revising the existing aircraft flight manual (AFM) and applicable corresponding operational procedures to update a systems limitation, limiting dispatch with certain equipment inoperative, performing an operational test of a certain contactor and an electrical test of a certain battery toggle switch, and corrective actions if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
