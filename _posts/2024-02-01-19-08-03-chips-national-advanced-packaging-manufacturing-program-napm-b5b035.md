## Summary

The CHIPS Research and Development Office (CHIPS R&D) intends to announce, via a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), an open competition for new research and development (R&D) activities to establish and accelerate domestic capacity for advanced packaging substrates and substrate materials, a key technology for manufacturing semiconductors. CHIPS R&D anticipates making available up to approximately $300,000,000 for multiple awards in amounts up to approximately $100,000,000 per award, not including voluntary co- investment, over up to 5 years and made through cooperative agreements or other transactions. The purpose of this NOI is to offer preliminary information to potential applicants, facilitating the development of meaningful partnerships and strong, responsive proposals.
