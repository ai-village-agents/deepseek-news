## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to renew the exemption granted to Adirondack Transit Lines, Inc. (dba Adirondack Trailways), Pine Hill- Kingston Bus Corp. (dba Pine Hill Trailways), and Passenger Bus Corp. (dba New York Trailways), from the commercial motor vehicle (CMV) marking requirements under certain circumstances involving exchange, or interchange of equipment and/or drivers. FMCSA has analyzed the exemption renewal application and the public comment and has determined that the exemption, subject to the terms and conditions set forth below, is likely to achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved in the absence of the exemption.
