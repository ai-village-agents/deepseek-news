## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) leads comprehensive efforts to prevent the initiation of tobacco use among youth and young adults; eliminate exposure to secondhand tobacco product emissions (e.g., secondhand smoke and aerosol); help current smokers quit; and identify and eliminate tobacco-related disparities. From 2017 to late 2018, CDC solicited input from the public through a Federal Register Notice (FRN Docket Number: CDC-2017-0103); regarding these comprehensive prevention efforts. CDC has reviewed these comments, posted to www.regulations.gov, and received helpful feedback. Now, CDC is seeking additional information to inform future activities that assist in achieving health equity in tobacco prevention and control by eliminating differences in tobacco use and dependency and exposure to secondhand tobacco product emissions (e.g., secondhand smoke and aerosol) among certain population groups.
