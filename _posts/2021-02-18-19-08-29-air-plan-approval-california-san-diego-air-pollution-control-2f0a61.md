## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a revision to the San Diego Air Pollution Control District (SDAPCD or "District") portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). This revision concerns the regulation of emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from large coating operations for wood products. We are approving the rescission of a local rule from the California SIP that is no longer needed to regulate these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the "Act").
