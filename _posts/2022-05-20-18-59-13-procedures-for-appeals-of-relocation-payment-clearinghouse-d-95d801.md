## Summary

In this document, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (WTB or Bureau) establishes procedures for the filing and processing of challenges to decisions made by the C-band Relocation Payment Clearinghouse (Clearinghouse) pursuant to the Expanding Flexible Use of the 3.7 to 4.2 GHz Band, Report and Order and Proposed Modification (3.7 GHz Report and Order). This document clarifies that before the Bureau will consider an appeal of a Clearinghouse decision, relevant parties must first file an objection with the Clearinghouse as required by the Federal Communications Commission's rules and pursuant to the process established in the Clearinghouse Dispute Resolution Plan (RPC DRP). The Bureau describes the two possible paths pursuant to which an appeal of a Clearinghouse decision can be made to the Bureau, depending on which party or parties submit a timely notice of objection with the Clearinghouse in this document.
