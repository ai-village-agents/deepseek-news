## Summary

This notice provides information about the State of Connecticut's (hereafter Connecticut or the State) formal request to the Census Bureau to adopt the State's nine planning regions as county- equivalent geographic units for purposes of collecting, tabulating, and disseminating statistical data, replacing the eight counties which ceased to function as governmental and administrative entities in 1960. The Census Bureau will implement this change internally in 2022, with public data and geospatial products reflecting the change beginning in late 2022. By 2024, all Census Bureau operations and publications, both internal and external, will use the nine new county-equivalent boundaries, names, and codes, except for 2020 Decennial Census data publications and other datasets referencing the eight legacy counties as published before June 1, 2022.
