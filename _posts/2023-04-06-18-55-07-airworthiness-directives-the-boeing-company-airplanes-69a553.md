## Summary

The FAA is revising a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that applied to certain The Boeing Company Model 747-8 and -8F series airplanes. This action revises the NPRM by revising certain compliance times. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive (AD) to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over that in the NPRM, the FAA is requesting comments on this SNPRM.
