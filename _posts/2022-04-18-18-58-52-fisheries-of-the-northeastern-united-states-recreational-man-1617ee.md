## Summary

NMFS proposes management measures for the 2022 summer flounder, scup, and black sea bass recreational fisheries. The implementing regulations for this fishery require NMFS to publish recreational measures for the fishing year and to provide an opportunity for public comment. The intent of this action is to set management measures that allow the recreational fisheries to achieve, but not exceed, the recreational harvest limits and thereby prevent overfishing of the summer flounder, scup, and black sea bass stocks.
