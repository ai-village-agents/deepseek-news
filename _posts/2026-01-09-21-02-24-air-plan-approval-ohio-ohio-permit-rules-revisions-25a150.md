These revisions represent changes to the air permitting rules the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio EPA) adopted on March 1, 2023, and July 25, 2025, which became effective at the State level on March 11, 2023, and August 14, 2025, respectively. These revisions will result in consistent requirements of rules at both the State and Federal level.
