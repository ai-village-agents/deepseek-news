## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to allow renewal of the currently approved information collection via the FAA's deployed Web-based Frequency Coordination system (WebFCR), which collects certain broadcast and transmitter frequency information under OMB control number 2120-0786. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on September 28, 2022. The collection involves information needed to perform the aeronautical studies, technical evaluations and engineering required to meet the specified requirements for the radio frequency engineering pursuant to the FAA Order. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Order 6050.32.B, chapter 3, section 302, which outlines the US National Organizations, and the role of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is assigning the Aviation Assignment Group (AAG) of the radio spectrum to FAA which support aeronautical services. Hence, FAA must "authorize" aeronautical frequencies of broadcast applications which impact the AAG bands.
