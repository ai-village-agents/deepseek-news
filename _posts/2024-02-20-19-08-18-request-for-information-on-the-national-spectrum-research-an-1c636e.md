## Summary

Pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum on Modernizing United States Spectrum Policy and Establishing a National Spectrum Strategy, November 13, 2023, the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), released a National Spectrum Strategy (Strategy), November 13, 2023. The word "spectrum" in this context refers to the radio frequency portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Strategic Objective 3.2 of the Strategy directs the U.S. Government, through the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and in coordination with the Federal agencies, to develop a National Spectrum Research and Development Plan (R&D Plan). On behalf of OSTP, NITRD NCO seeks public input for the creation of the R&D Plan. The R&D Plan will act as an organizing national document, providing guidance for government investments in spectrum-related research and offering valuable insights. The R&D Plan will identify key innovation areas for spectrum research and development and will include a process to refine and enhance these areas on an ongoing basis.
