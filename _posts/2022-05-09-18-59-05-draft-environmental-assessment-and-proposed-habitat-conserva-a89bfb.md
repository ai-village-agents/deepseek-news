## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, have received an application from Fowler Ridge Wind Farm LLC, Fowler Ridge II Wind Farm LLC, Fowler Ridge III Wind Farm LLC, and Fowler Ridge IV Wind Farm LLC, collectively referred to as Fowler Ridge (applicant), to amend an existing incidental take permit (ITP) under the Endangered Species Act, for its Fowler Ridge Wind Farm (project). If approved, the ITP would be extended for an additional 10-year period and would add authorization of incidental take of a threatened species, the northern long-eared bat, to the currently existing authorization to incidentally take the endangered Indiana bat. The applicant has prepared a proposed habitat conservation plan amendment that describes the actions and measures that the applicant would implement to avoid, minimize, and mitigate incidental take of the Indiana bat and northern long-eared bat. We also announce the availability of a draft environmental assessment, which has been prepared in response to the permit application in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. We request public comment on the application and associated documents.
