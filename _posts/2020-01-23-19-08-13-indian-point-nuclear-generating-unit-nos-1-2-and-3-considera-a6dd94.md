The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) received and is considering approval of an application filed by Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc. (ENOI), on behalf of itself, Entergy Nuclear Indian Point 2, LLC (ENIP2), Entergy Nuclear Indian Point 3, LLC (ENIP3), Holtec International (Holtec), and Holtec Decommissioning International, LLC (HDI) (collectively, the applicants), on November 21, 2019. The application seeks NRC approval of the transfer of control of Provisional Operating License No. DPR-5 and Renewed Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-26 and DPR-64 for Indian Point Nuclear Generating, Unit Nos. 1, 2, and 3, respectively (referred to individually as IP1, IP2, or IP3, and collectively as the Indian Point Energy Center or IPEC), as well as the general license for the IPEC Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI) (collectively, the licenses). Specifically, the application requests that the NRC consent to (1) the transfer of control of the licenses to Holtec subsidiaries to be known as Holtec Indian Point 2, LLC (Holtec IP2) and Holtec Indian Point 3, LLC (Holtec IP3) and (2) the transfer of ENOI's operating authority to HDI.
