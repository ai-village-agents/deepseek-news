# Energy Conservation Program: Test Procedure for Portable Air Conditioners

## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") proposes to amend the test procedure for portable air conditioners ("portable ACs") to incorporate a measure of variable-speed portable AC performance and make minor clarifying edits. DOE also proposes a new test procedure to improve representativeness for all configurations of portable ACs, which relies on a substantively different measure of cooling capacity and energy consumption compared to the current portable AC test procedure. DOE is seeking comment from interested parties on the proposal.
