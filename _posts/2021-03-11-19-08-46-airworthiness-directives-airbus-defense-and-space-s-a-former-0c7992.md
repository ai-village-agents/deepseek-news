## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Defense and Space S.A. Model C-212-CB, C-212-CC, C- 212-CD, C-212-CE, C-212-CF, C-212-DE, and C-212-DF airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of cracks on the left-hand (LH) and right-hand (RH) side fuselage skin and on frame (FR) 5 underneath the skin, near the leading edge of the wing. This proposed AD would require repetitive inspections of the LH and RH side center wing fairings at FR 5, around the wing leading edge for discrepancies (cracks) and repair, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
