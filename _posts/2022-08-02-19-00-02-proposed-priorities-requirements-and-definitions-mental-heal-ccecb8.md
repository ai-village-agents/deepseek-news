## Summary

The Department of Education (Department) proposes priorities, requirements, and definitions under the Mental Health Service Professional Demonstration Grant Program, Assistance Listing Number 84.184X. We may use one or more of these priorities, requirements, and definitions for competitions in fiscal year (FY) 2022 and later years. We propose priorities, requirements, and definitions designed to provide competitive grants to support and demonstrate innovative partnerships to train school-based mental health services providers (as defined in section 4102 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended (ESEA)) for employment in schools and local educational agencies (LEAs). The goal of the program is to increase the number of high-quality, trained providers to address the shortages of mental health services professionals in schools served by high-need LEAs.
