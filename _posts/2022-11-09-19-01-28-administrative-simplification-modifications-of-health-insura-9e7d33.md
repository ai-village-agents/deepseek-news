## Summary

This proposed rule would adopt updated versions of the retail pharmacy standards for electronic transactions adopted under the Administrative Simplification subtitle of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). These updated versions would be modifications to the currently adopted standards for the following retail pharmacy transactions: health care claims or equivalent encounter information; eligibility for a health plan; referral certification and authorization; and coordination of benefits. The proposed rule would also broaden the applicability of the Medicaid pharmacy subrogation transaction to all health plans. To that end, the rule would rename and revise the definition of the transaction and adopt an updated standard, which would be a modification for state Medicaid agencies and an initial standard for all other health plans.
