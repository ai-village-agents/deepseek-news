## Summary

The Privacy Act of 1974 requires that all agencies publish in the Federal Register a notice of the existence and character of their systems of records. Notice is hereby given that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is establishing a new system of records entitled "Veterans Affairs Profile-VA" (VA Profile) (192VA30). This system of records is an enterprise Master Data Management (MDM) solution that modernizes VA systems by ensuring VA customer data is synchronized and shared across the VA, regardless of the channel used to provide the information. This system of records contains VA customer contact information to support a range of business activities that are used by Veterans, eligible beneficiaries, other VA customers, and the different administrations supporting VA customers.
