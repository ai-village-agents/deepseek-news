## Summary

The Office of Community Services (OCS), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is requesting a 3-year extension of the Community Economic Development (CED) Performance Progress Report (PPR) (Office of Management and Budget (OMB) #: 0970-0386), expiration date February 28, 2026, with revisions to support a quarterly reporting schedule. This request updates burden estimates to account for new quarterly reporting requirements. While the core CED PPR form remains unchanged and will still be submitted semi-annually, new awardees must now report quarterly. In alternate quarters (Q1 and Q3), they will complete a shorter version of the form with narrative updates only.
