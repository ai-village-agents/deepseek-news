## Summary

The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a semi- autonomous agency within the United States (U.S.) Department of Energy (DOE), announces the availability of a Final Supplement Analysis (SA) of the Complex Transformation Supplemental Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (SPEIS) (DOE/EIS-0236-SA-02). NNSA prepared the Final SA to determine whether, prior to implementing a Modified Distributed Center of Excellence (DCE) Alternative for plutonium operations to enable producing plutonium pits at a rate of no fewer than 80 pits per year by 2030, the existing Complex Transformation SPEIS should be supplemented, a new environmental impact statement be prepared, or that no further National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) analysis is required. NNSA published the Draft Supplement Analysis of the Complex Transformation Supplemental Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement on June 28, 2019, and announced a 45-day comment period. After considering all comments received, NNSA prepared the Final SA and concluded that no further NEPA documentation at a programmatic level is required.
