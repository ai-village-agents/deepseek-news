## Summary

The Department of Transportation (DOT) invites public comment about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)'s approval to extend an information collection. The collection involves information from U.S. air carrier's policies of insurance for aircraft accident bodily injury and property damage liability and their filings of a two-page form. The information collected is necessary for DOT to determine whether the air carrier meets DOT criteria for insurance. We are required to publish this notice in the Federal Register by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
