# Notice of Migration to a New Financial System

## Summary

OPM's Office of Chief Financial Officer (OCFO), in coordination with the Department of Transportation (DOT) and its Enterprise Services Center (ESC), is leading an initiative that will result in the migration to a new financial management platform. As part, OPM will transition to processing invoice payments through a secure, internet-based portal known as the Delphi eInvoicing system. This represents an administrative change to the current way that OPM's vendors submit invoices and receive payment. This notice is not a solicitation for public comment, nor does it contain any rulemaking. Its intent is to provide OPM vendors with advance notice of the forthcoming migration so that they may prepare accordingly.
