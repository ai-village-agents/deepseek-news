## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FMCSA announces its plan to submit the Information Collection Request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review and approval and invites public comment. This ICR will enable FMCSA to document the burden associated with the for-hire truck leasing regulations and passenger carrier regulations. These regulations require certain for-hire property carriers and certain for-hire and private passenger carriers to have a formal lease when leasing equipment from other motor carriers. FMCSA requests approval to renew an ICR titled, "Lease and Interchange of Vehicles."
