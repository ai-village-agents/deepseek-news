## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve changes to the Tennessee State Implementation Plan (SIP) and the Tennessee title V operating permit program (title V) submitted by the State of Tennessee, through the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC), Division of Air Pollution Control on March 23, 2021, and supplemented on July 1, 2022. These changes address the public notice rule provisions for the New Source Review (NSR) and title V programs of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) by providing for electronic notice (e-notice) and removing the mandatory requirement to provide public notice of a draft air permit in a newspaper. EPA is proposing to approve these changes as they are consistent with the CAA and implementing Federal regulations.
