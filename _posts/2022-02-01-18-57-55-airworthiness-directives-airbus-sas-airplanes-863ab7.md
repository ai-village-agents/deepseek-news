## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A300 series airplanes; Airbus SAS Model A300 B4-600, B4-600R, and F4-600R series airplanes, and Model A300 C4-605R Variant F airplanes (collectively called Model A300-600 series airplanes); and Airbus SAS Model A310 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of incorrect installation of the fire shut-off valves (FSOV) actuator, which was found to rotate around its pivot axis. This AD requires a one-time detailed inspection of the FSOV actuator for rotation around its pivot axis, and replacement if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
