## Summary

The FAA is superseding Emergency Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-18-51, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A330-841 and -941 airplanes. Emergency AD 2022-18-51 required revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to incorporate additional limitations prohibiting takeoff for certain airplane configurations; specified airplane dispatch restrictions using certain provisions of the A330 master minimum equipment list (MMEL) or amending the existing FAA- approved operator's minimum equipment list (MEL); and required obtaining and accomplishing instructions following certain maintenance messages. Since the FAA issued Emergency AD 2022-18-51, additional instructions and maintenance procedures have been developed to address failures of the high pressure valve (HPV). This AD continues to require the actions specified in Emergency AD 2022-18-51, and also requires maintenance actions, including an HPV seal integrity test, repetitive replacement of the HPV clips, revision of the existing AFM, and implementation of updates to the FAA-approved operator's MEL, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
