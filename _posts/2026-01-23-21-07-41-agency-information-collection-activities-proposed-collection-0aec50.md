This collection is a new collection for identifying and describing the sources of food waste; identifying and describing how much food waste can be attributed to these different sources in U.S. households overall and by food category; identifying and describing how estimates of food waste attributable to each source, overall and by food category, are associated with household characteristics including household income and per capita food-at-home expenditure; identifying and describing how estimates of food waste attributable to each source, overall and by food category, are associated with adherence to best practices in minimizing household food waste; identifying and describing the minimum level of food waste by source, overall, and by food category, observable in a nationally representative sample of U.S. households; and using information collected from objectives 1-5 to develop updated food waste estimates and a predictive model that estimates the proportion of food waste at the household level for varied household types.
