## Summary

Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), as amended, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston District (USACE) intends to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Cedar Port Navigation and Improvement District Channel Deepening Project. The EIS would be prepared in association with a feasibility report prepared by a Non- Federal Interest (NFI)--the Cedar Port Navigation and Improvement District (CPNID) under authority granted by section 203 of WRDA 1986. The study will identify and evaluate the feasibility of providing a deep-water connection between the Houston Ship Channel (HSC) and a planned future deepwater terminal facility at Cedar Port Industrial Park while enhancing efficient, safe, and reliable navigation in the Cedar Bayou Navigation Channel and HSC to existing stakeholder terminals. This notice announces the USACE's intent to determine the scope of the issues to be addressed and identify the significant environmental issues related to the proposed action.
