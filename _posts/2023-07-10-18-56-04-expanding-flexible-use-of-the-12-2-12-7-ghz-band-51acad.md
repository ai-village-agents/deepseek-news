## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) seeks further comment on how it could facilitate more robust terrestrial operations in the 12.2-12.7 GHz (12.2 GHz) band through additional possible terrestrial uses of the band including one- way, point-to-point or point-to-multipoint fixed links at higher powers than current Multichannel Video Distribution and Data Service (MVDDS) rules permit; two-way, point-to-point fixed links at standard part 101 power limits; two-way, point-to-multipoint links; indoor only underlay on a licensed by rule basis; unlicensed use; and expanded use through technology-based sharing using Automated Frequency Coordination. In their responses to these inquiries, the Commission strongly encourages commenters to provide specific proposals and detailed technical data to support their proposals.
