## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) builds on the 6 GHz band unlicensed rules by permitting very low power (VLP) devices in the U-NII-5 (5.925-6.425 MHz) and U- NII-7 (6.525-6.875 MHz) portions of the 6 GHz band. The Commission will limit VLP devices to low power levels and subject them to other technical and operational requirements that will permit these devices to operate across the United States while protecting incumbent licensed services that operate in the 6 GHz band from harmful interference. The Commission also takes action in a Memorandum Opinion and Order on Remand that addresses a remand from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concerning an issue raised by television broadcasters. The Commission finds that broadcasters' unsubstantiated claims of interference in the 2.4 GHz band do not warrant any changes to the 6 GHz rules.
