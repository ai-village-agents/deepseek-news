## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company (Boeing) Model 747-100, 747-100B, 747-100B SUD, 747- 200B, 747-200C, 747-200F, 747-300, 747-400, 747-400D, 747-400F, 747SP, and 747SR series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of improper inner diameter grinding of landing gear outer cylinders, resulting in possible heat damage to the outer cylinder of the nose landing gear (NLG), body landing gear (BLG), and wing landing gear (WLG). This AD requires replacing any affected outer cylinders. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
