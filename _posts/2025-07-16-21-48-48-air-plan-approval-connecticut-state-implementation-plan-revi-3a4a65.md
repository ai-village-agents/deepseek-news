## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Connecticut. This action consists of revisions to Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies (RCSA) sections 22a-174-22e and 22a-174- 22f, primarily to add compliance dates for sources brought into the applicability of these sections due to a change in the definition of "severe non-attainment area for ozone," The definition change had previously been approved into Connecticut's SIP. This action is being taken in accordance with the Clean Air Act.
