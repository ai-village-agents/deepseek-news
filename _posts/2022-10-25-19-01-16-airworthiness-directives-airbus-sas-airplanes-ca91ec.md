## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-16- 03, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. AD 2021-16-03 required an inspection for missing or incorrect application of the lightning strike edge glow sealant protection at certain locations in the wing tanks, and corrective action. This AD was prompted by in-production findings of missing or incorrect application of the lightning strike edge glow sealant protection at specific locations in the wing tanks and by the development of a modification to restore two independent layers of lightning strike protection on the wing upper cover. This AD continues to require the actions of AD 2021-16-03 and requires a modification to restore two independent layers of lightning strike protection, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
