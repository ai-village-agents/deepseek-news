## Summary

The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), on behalf of the Interagency Council for Advancing Meteorological Services (ICAMS), requests input from all interested parties to identify opportunities for, and inform the advancement of Federal meteorological services across the meteorological enterprise. ICAMS invites input from States; Tribes; territories; individuals, including those belonging to groups that have been historically underserved, marginalized, or subject to discrimination or systemic disadvantage; local governments; appropriate industries; academic institutions; nongovernmental organizations; and international organizations with expertise in meteorological research and development, and service delivery, in both the short- (2-3 years) and long-term (next decade). This information will be used to inform the development of a new decadal strategic plan for Federal coordination of meteorological science and services using an earth system approach.
