## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are reopening the public comment period on our September 30, 2021, proposal to remove the ivory-billed woodpecker from the Federal Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants (List) due to extinction. We are taking this action to conduct a public hearing on the proposal to remove the ivory-billed woodpecker from the List and to allow all interested parties additional time to comment on the proposed rule to delist the ivory-billed woodpecker (docket number: FWS-R4-ES-2020- 0109). Comments previously submitted need not be resubmitted and will be fully considered in preparation of the final rule. This comment period reopening is only for the ivory-billed woodpecker proposed delisting; we are not taking any comments in regard to the other 22 species proposed in the same rule, for which the comment periods closed on November 29, 2021.
