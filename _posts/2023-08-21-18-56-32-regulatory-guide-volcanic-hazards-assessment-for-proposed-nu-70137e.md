## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing Revision 1 to Regulatory Guide (RG) 4.26 "Volcanic Hazards Assessment for Proposed Nuclear Power Reactor Sites," to restore text and a Section heading inadvertently omitted from Section C, "Staff Regulatory Guidance," of Revision 0. The restored text appeared in the draft guide released for public comment. In addition, there is a minor update of the Paperwork Reduction Act text in the RG. The changes do not represent substantive changes in the NRC staff's regulatory positions.
