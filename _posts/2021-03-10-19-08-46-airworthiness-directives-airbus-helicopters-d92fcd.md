## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-23- 02, which applied to all Airbus Helicopters Model EC225LP helicopters. AD 2020-23-02 required repetitive inspections of the bearing in the swashplate assembly of the main rotor mast assembly for discrepancies (ceramic balls that have a hard point or sensitive axial play or both) and, depending on the findings, replacement of an affected main rotor mast assembly with a serviceable main rotor mast assembly. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-23-02, the FAA has determined additional main rotor mast assemblies are affected by the unsafe condition. This AD continues to require the actions specified in AD 2020-23-02, and also includes additional affected main rotor mast assemblies; as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
