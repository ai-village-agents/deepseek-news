## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-2A12 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that some of the multi-function spoiler (MFS) anti-rotation plates failed in-service due to a thin wall design. This AD requires replacing the MFS anti-rotation plates, inspecting the MFS anti-rotation plates for cracking and hinge bolts for evidence of rotation, accomplishing applicable corrective actions, and performing a functional test of the MFS control surfaces. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
