## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by two engine fan blade-out (FBO) events that resulted in the separation of engine inlet cowl and fan cowl parts from the airplane damaging the fuselage, which caused loss of pressurization and subsequent emergency descent. The FBO events also resulted in cracks in the primary exhaust nozzle, potentially resulting in the departure of the primary exhaust nozzle and damaging a stabilizer or striking the fuselage and window. This proposed AD would require an inspection or maintenance records check to determine if the primary exhaust nozzle has an affected part number and, for affected primary exhaust nozzles, an installation of bridge brackets onto the primary exhaust nozzle, or as an option, an installation of a serviceable primary exhaust nozzle. This proposed AD would also require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new airworthiness limitations. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
