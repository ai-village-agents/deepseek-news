## Summary

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is proposing new regulations to reduce the waste of natural gas from venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and gas production activities on Federal and Indian leases. The proposed regulations would be codified in the Code of Federal Regulations and would replace the BLM's current requirements governing venting and flaring, which are more than four decades old.
