## Summary

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) proposes a noncompetitive (direct) sale of 20 acres to the City of Apache Junction (City) in accordance with the applicable provisions of Sections 203 and 209 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) and the BLM land sale regulations. Since the Recreation and Public Purposes Act (R&PP) does not authorize uses aimed predominately at producing revenue or where the principal use is a commercial activity, the City would like to further develop and operate the land through a direct sale. The appraised Fair Market Value (FMV) of the parcel is $1,400,000.
