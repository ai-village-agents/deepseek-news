## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directives (ADs) 2012-22- 05 and 2018-19-03, which applied to certain Fokker Services B.V. Model F28 Mark 0070 and 0100 airplanes. AD 2012-22-05 required inspecting for cracks of the pistons on the main landing gear (MLG), and replacing the affected pistons if necessary. AD 2012-22-05 also required modifying the MLG, and revising the airplane maintenance program. AD 2018-19-03 required an inspection of the MLG, and replacement if necessary. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2012-22-05, expands the applicability, and requires a new modification or replacement of the MLG; as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD was prompted by a determination that the required heat treatment may not have been applied to certain MLG pistons. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
