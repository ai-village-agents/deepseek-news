## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve the portion of a Wyoming State Implementation Plan (SIP) submission addressing interstate transport for the 2015 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). EPA is also withdrawing our prior May 24, 2022 proposed disapproval of the interstate transport portion of the Wyoming SIP submission. The "good neighbor" or "interstate transport" provision requires that each state's SIP contain adequate provisions to prohibit emissions from within the state from significantly contributing to nonattainment or interfering with maintenance of the NAAQS in other states. This requirement is part of the broader set of "infrastructure" requirements, which are designed to ensure that the structural components of each state's air quality management program are adequate to meet the state's responsibilities under the CAA.
