## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of a frame web crack at a certain fuselage station (STA) between certain stringers common to the frame web notch. This AD requires repetitive inspections for cracks of the frames and repair of cracks. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
