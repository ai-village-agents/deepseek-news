## Summary

The Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM), as a part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, invites the general public and other Federal Agencies to comment on the proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The Multi-Buyer Policy: Reasonable Spread of Risk (RSOR) Exclusions Worksheet will be used by external customers, current policyholders and portfolio managers to determine eligibility of Export-Import Bank support under the RSOR Policy. Program changes that were made in 2017 have resulted in revitalized demand of the RSOR product in the marketplace. This form will be available on EXIM's website and will standardize the collection of required information into a user friendly format that can be submitted electronically via email or as an attachment to an EXIM Online application.
