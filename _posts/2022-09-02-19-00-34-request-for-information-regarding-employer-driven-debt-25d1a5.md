## Summary

On June 9, 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau or CFPB) issued a request for information seeking input from the public on debt obligations incurred by consumers in the context of an employment or independent contractor arrangement. The request for information was published in the Federal Register on June 17, 2022, and provided for a comment period that was set to expire on September 7, 2022. To allow interested persons more time to gather the requested information and submit comments, the Bureau has determined that an extension of the comment period until September 23, 2022, is appropriate.
