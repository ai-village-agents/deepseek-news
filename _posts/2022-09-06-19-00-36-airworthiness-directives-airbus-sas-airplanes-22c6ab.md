## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-10- 24, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A330-200 series airplanes, Model A330-200 Freighter series airplanes, and Model A330- 300 series airplanes; AD 2018-23-14, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A330-200 series airplanes, Model A330-200 Freighter series airplanes, and Model A330-300 series airplanes; and AD 2021-05-12, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A330-200 Freighter series airplanes. AD 2017-10-24, AD 2018-23-14, and AD 2021-05-12 require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. This AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD revises the applicability by adding airplanes. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2018-23-14 and AD 2021-05-12, and requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
