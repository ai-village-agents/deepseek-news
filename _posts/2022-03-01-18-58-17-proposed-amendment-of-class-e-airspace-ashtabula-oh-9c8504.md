## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace at Ashtabula, OH. The FAA is proposing this action due to an airspace review conducted as part of the decommissioning of the Jefferson very high frequency (VHF) omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimal Operational Network (MON) Program. The name and geographic coordinates of the airport would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
