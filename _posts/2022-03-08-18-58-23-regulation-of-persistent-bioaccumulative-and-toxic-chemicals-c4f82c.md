Specifically, EPA is extending the compliance date applicable to the prohibition on processing and distribution in commerce of certain PIP (3:1)-containing articles, and the PIP (3:1) used to make those articles, until October 31, 2024, along with the compliance date for the associated recordkeeping requirements for manufacturers, processors, and distributors of PIP (3:1)-containing articles. This final rule follows issuance of a proposed rule for public comment on October 28, 2021; comments on the proposed rule are responded to in this action.
