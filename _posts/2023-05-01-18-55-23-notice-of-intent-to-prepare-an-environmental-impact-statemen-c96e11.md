## Summary

In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (NEPA), and consistent with direction from the U.S. District Court of Montana, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) intends to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) to analyze the potential environmental effects from maintaining or revoking former Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell's coal leasing moratorium. This notice begins the process of defining the scope of the EIS by providing background on the Federal coal program and the direction received from the United States District Court for the District of Montana in Citizens for Clean Energy, v. U.S. Dep't of the Interior. With this notice, the BLM also solicits public comments for consideration in establishing the scope and content of the EIS.
