## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG Trent 1000-AE3, Trent 1000-CE3, Trent 1000-D3, Trent 1000-G3, Trent 1000-H3, Trent 1000-J3, Trent 1000-K3, Trent 1000-L3, Trent 1000-M3, Trent 1000-N3, Trent 1000- P3, Trent 1000-Q3, Trent 1000-R3, Trent 7000-72, and Trent 7000-72C model turbofan engines. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a crack finding of the front air seal on the intermediate-pressure compressor (IPC) shaft assembly during the stripping of a flight test engine. This proposed AD would require initial and repetitive borescope inspections (BSIs) of the IPC shaft assembly and, depending on the results of the inspection, replacement of the IPC shaft assembly with a part eligible for installation. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
