## Summary

This action revokes the Class E surface airspace at Tri-County Regional Airport, Lone Rock, WI, and amends the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Tri-County Regional Airport and Richland Airport, Richland Center, WI. This action is the result of airspace reviews caused by the decommissioning of the Lone Rock VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) navigation aid as part of the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program. The names and geographic coordinates of the airport are also being updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
