## Summary

As part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, FinCEN invites comments on the proposed renewal, without change, of a currently approved information collection found in existing Bank Secrecy Act regulations. Specifically, the regulations permit banks to file a FinCEN Report 110, Designation of Exempt Person ("DOEP Report"), to designate eligible customers as exempt persons, such that a bank is not required to file a report with respect to any transaction in currency over $10,000 with such customers. Under the regulations, a bank, to exempt a person, must also take steps to ensure that a person meets the requirements for an exemption, document the basis for the bank's initial conclusion that a person is exempt, annually review the eligibility of certain exempt persons, document compliance with the DOEP Report requirements, and maintain a monitoring system that is reasonably designed to detect, for each account of a non-listed business or payroll customer, transactions in currency requiring a bank to file a suspicious transaction report. Although no changes are proposed to the information collection itself, this request for comments covers a future expansion of the scope of the annual hourly burden and cost estimate associated with these regulations. This request for comments is made pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
