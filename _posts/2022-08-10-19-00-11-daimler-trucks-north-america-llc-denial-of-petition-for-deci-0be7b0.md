## Summary

Daimler Trucks North America, LLC (DTNA) has determined that certain model year (MY) 2011-2021 Thomas Built Saf-T-Liner HDX school buses do not fully comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 222, School Bus Passenger Seating and Crash Protection. DTNA filed a noncompliance report dated December 17, 2019, and later amended the report on January 16, 2020. DTNA subsequently petitioned NHTSA on January 16, 2020, (DTNA incorrectly dated their petition January 16, 2019) for a decision that the subject noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. This document announces and explains the denial of DTNA's petition.
