## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 777 airplanes. This AD was prompted by fuel system reviews conducted by the manufacturer. This AD requires, depending on the airplane configuration, installation of Teflon sleeves, cap sealing of fasteners, detailed inspections, and corrective actions. This AD also requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate more restrictive airworthiness limitations (AWLs). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
