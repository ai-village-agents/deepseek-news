## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports indicating that protective caps were found on engine fire extinguishing pipes in the engine core zone (Zone 2) after airplane delivery. This AD requires a one-time inspection of the engine fire extinguishing pipes for the presence of protective caps and removal of any protective caps found, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
