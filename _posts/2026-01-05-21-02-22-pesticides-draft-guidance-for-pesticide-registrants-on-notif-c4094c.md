## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is announcing the availability of and seeking public comment on a draft Pesticide Registration Notice (PR Notice) entitled "Pesticide Registration (PR) Notice 2026-NEW: Notifications, Non-Notifications, and Minor Formulation Amendments." PR Notices are issued by the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) to inform pesticide registrants and other interested persons about important policies, procedures, and registration related decisions, and serve to provide guidance to pesticide registrants and OPP personnel. This draft PR Notice, when final, will supersede PR Notice 98-10, entitled "Notifications, Non- notifications and Minor Formulation Amendments" dated October 22, 1998, in its entirety. In addition, the guidance in this draft PR Notice allowing for additions, modifications, or deletions of mandatory or advisory statements will supersede the contrary guidance in section II of PR Notice 2000-5, dated May 10, 2000, that requires such changes be submitted by amendment. EPA believes these changes align with Pillar 1 ("Clean Air, Land, and Water for Every American") and Pillar 3 ("Permitting Reform") of the five pillars underpinning the Administrator's "Powering the Great American Comeback" initiative as these changes will improve submissions and save registrants and OPP time and resources, while maintaining full protection of human health and the environment.
