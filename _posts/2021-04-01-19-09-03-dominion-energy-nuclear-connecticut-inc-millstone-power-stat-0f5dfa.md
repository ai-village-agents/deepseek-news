## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering issuance of an amendment to Renewed Facility Operating License No. NPF- 49, issued to Dominion Energy Nuclear Connecticut, Inc., for operation of the Millstone Power Station, Unit 3 (MPS3). The proposed amendment would revise the renewed facility operating license and technical specifications (TSs) to support a measurement uncertainty recapture power uprate from 3,650 megawatts thermal (MWt) to 3,709 MWt. For this amendment request, the NRC proposes to determine that it involves no significant hazards consideration. Because this amendment request contains sensitive unclassified non-safeguards information (SUNSI), an order imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI for contention preparation. The proposed amendment was previously noticed on January 26, 2021 (86 FR 7115), and is being re-noticed to include the instructions for requesting access to SUNSI.
