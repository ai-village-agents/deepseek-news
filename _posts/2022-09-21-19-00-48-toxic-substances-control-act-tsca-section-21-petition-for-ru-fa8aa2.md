## Summary

This action announces the availability of EPA's response to a petition received on June 16, 2022, from Daniel M. Galpern on behalf of Donn J. Viviani, John Birks, Richard Heede, Lise Van Susteren, James E. Hansen, Climate Science, Awareness and Solutions, and Climate Protection and Restoration Initiative (the petitioners). The petitioners request that EPA in general phase out the anthropogenic manufacture, processing, distribution, use, and disposal of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, fossil fuels, and fossil fuel emissions. They also request multiple actions under TSCA, and actions pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), and the Independent Offices Appropriations Act (IOAA). EPA has determined that the request for risk management rulemaking under TSCA is within the ambit of a petition under TSCA's provision for a citizen petition. EPA is treating the other actions requested as petitions under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which this notice does not address. EPA shares the petitioners' concerns regarding the threat posed by climate change, and the Biden Administration will continue to combat the climate crisis with a whole of government approach. Nonetheless, after careful consideration, EPA has denied the petition for the reasons set forth in this notice.
