## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a revision to the Maricopa County Air Quality Department (MCAQD) portion of the Arizona State Implementation Plan (SIP). This revision concerns emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from petroleum solvents used in dry cleaning. We are approving a local rule that regulates these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act").
