## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for a new information collection. The collection involves the possibility for airplane manufacturers for which the airplane is subject to the applicability of Annex 16, Volume III of the Convention on Civil Aviation (hereinafter the "Chicago Convention") to submit electronically CO<INF>2</INF> Certification Database (CO<INF>2</INF>DB) Datasheet(s) to the FAA. The information to be collected will be necessary because of FAA's commitment to help (a) provide publicly available data on the CO<INF>2</INF> Metric Value (MV) which represents a measure of fuel burn performance of airplane types against CO<INF>2</INF> technology/design standards, (b) track and communicate the improvement in airplane CO<INF>2</INF> MVs over time and (c) provide an incentive to improve the CO<INF>2</INF> MV of airplane types.
