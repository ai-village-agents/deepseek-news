## Summary

This document announces U.S. Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) modification of the National Customs Automation Program (NCAP) test concerning Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) Portal Accounts to establish the ACE Vessel Agency Portal Account, and to decommission the Cartman and Lighterman Portal Accounts due to a lack of usage by the public. The ACE Vessel Agency Portal Account will include access to Vessel Entrance and Clearance Reports. Account ownership will be a prerequisite for eligibility in the forthcoming Maritime Forms Automation Test pilot, which will allow Vessel Agency Account users to file electronic Vessel Entrance and Clearance Statements through the Vessel Entrance and Clearance System (VECS). This notice describes the eligibility and documentation requirements to apply for a Vessel Agency Portal Account and invites public comment concerning any aspect of these modifications to the ACE Portal Account Test.
