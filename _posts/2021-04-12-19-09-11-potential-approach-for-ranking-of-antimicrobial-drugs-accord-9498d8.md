## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency) is reopening the comment period for the notice announcing a public meeting and requesting comments that appeared in the Federal Register of October 13, 2020. In that notice, FDA announced a public meeting, which was held on November 16, 2020, and requested public input on a potential revised approach for considering the human medical importance of antimicrobial new animal drugs when assessing and managing the antimicrobial resistance risks associated with the use of antimicrobial drugs in animals. Specifically, the Agency requested comments on the potential revised process for ranking antimicrobials according to their relative importance in human medicine, on the potential criteria for their ranking, and on the resulting ranked list of antimicrobial drugs. We are taking this action in response to technical difficulties submitting comments to the Federal eRulemaking portal.
