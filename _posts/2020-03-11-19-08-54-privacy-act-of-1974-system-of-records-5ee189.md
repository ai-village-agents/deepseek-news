## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to establish a new DHS system of records titled, "Department of Homeland Security/ALL-044 DHS eRulemaking System of Records." DHS eRulemaking allows the public to search, view, download, and comment on all DHS rulemaking and notice documents in one central online system. It consists of a public facing interface, www.regulations.gov, and a portal visible to DHS, called the Federal Docket Management System (FDMS). This system of records notice covers the various records maintained by the Department of Homeland Security and its Components pertaining to written data, views, or arguments submitted to the Department. This newly established system will be included in DHS's inventory of record systems.
