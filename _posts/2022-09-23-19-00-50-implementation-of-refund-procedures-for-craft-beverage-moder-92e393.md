## Summary

Elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, by means of a temporary rule, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) is implementing certain changes made to the Internal Revenue Code by the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020 (Tax Relief Act of 2020), which amended the Craft Beverage Modernization Act (CBMA) provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The temporary rule establishes procedures for taking advantage of quantity-limited reduced tax rates and tax credits applicable to imported alcohol products. The text of the regulations in that temporary rule serves as the text of the proposed regulations. This document also proposes to amend the regulations to clarify that a foreign producer may not assign CBMA tax benefits on distilled spirits, wine, or beer unless it produces the product. In this document, TTB is soliciting comments on the regulatory amendments adopted in the temporary rule and on the amendment proposed in this notice of proposed rulemaking.
