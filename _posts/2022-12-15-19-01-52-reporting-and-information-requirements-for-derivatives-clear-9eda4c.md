## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC or Commission) is proposing to amend certain reporting and information regulations applicable to derivatives clearing organizations (DCOs). These proposed amendments would, among other things, update information requirements associated with commingling customer funds and positions in futures and swaps in the same account, address certain systems-related reporting obligations regarding exceptional events, revise certain daily and event-specific reporting requirements, and include in an appendix the fields that a DCO is required to provide on a daily basis. In addition, the Commission is proposing to amend certain delegation provisions.
