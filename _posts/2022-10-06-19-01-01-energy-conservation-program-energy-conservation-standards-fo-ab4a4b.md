## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is initiating an effort to determine whether to amend the current energy conservation standards for metal halide lamp fixtures ("MHLF"). On October 25, 2021, DOE published a final determination concluding that energy conservation standards for MHLFs do not need to be amended because they are not economically justified. No later than 3 years after such a determination, under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended, DOE must periodically review these standards and publish either a notice of proposed rulemaking ("NOPR") to propose new standards for MHLFs or a notification of determination that the existing standards do not need to be amended. This request for information ("RFI") solicits information from the public to help DOE determine whether amended standards for MHLFs would result in significant energy savings and whether such standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified. As part of this RFI, DOE seeks comment on technological and market changes since the most recent standards update to consider in its evaluation of more stringent standards. DOE also welcomes written comments from the public on any subject within the scope of this document (including those topics not specifically raised), as well as the submission of data and other relevant information.
