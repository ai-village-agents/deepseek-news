## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued a Confirmatory Order to ProTechnics Division of Core Laboratories LP (ProTechnics) to document commitments made as part of a settlement agreement made between the NRC and ProTechnics following an alternative dispute resolution mediation session held on October 12, 2023. The mediation addressed six apparent violations involving ProTechnics' abandonment of well logging sources, compliance with disposal of effluents limits within the Gulf of Mexico, and compliance with NRC requirements for monitoring occupational radiation exposure. ProTechnics has committed to various measures intended to improve the effectiveness of its radiation safety program, develop better well logging source abandonment procedures, and to train its employees on occupational exposure limits and the proper use of dosimetry. The Confirmatory Order is effective upon issuance.
