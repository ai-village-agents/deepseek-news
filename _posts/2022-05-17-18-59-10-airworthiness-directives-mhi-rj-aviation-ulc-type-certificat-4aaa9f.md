## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain MHI RJ Aviation ULC Model CL-600-2C10 (Regional Jet Series 700, 701 & 702); CL-600-2C11 (Regional Jet Series 550); CL-600-2D15 (Regional Jet Series 705); CL-600-2D24 (Regional Jet Series 900); and CL-600-2E25 (Regional Jet Series 1000) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by laboratory tests that showed that the oxygen tubes of the crew oxygen system may be contaminated with lubricants, as a result of the manufacturing and cleaning procedures used. This proposed AD would require cleaning and flushing the crew oxygen system. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
