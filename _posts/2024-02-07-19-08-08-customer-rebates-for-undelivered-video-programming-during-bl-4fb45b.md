# Customer Rebates for Undelivered Video Programming During Blackouts

## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) seeks comment on whether to require cable operators and direct broadcast satellite (DBS) providers to give their subscribers rebates when those subscribers are deprived of video programming they expect to receive during programming blackouts that result from failed retransmission consent negotiations or failed non-broadcast carriage negotiations. When such blackouts occur, subscribers often pay the same monthly subscription fee for a service package that does not include all of the channels for which they signed up to receive. In other words, consumers are paying for a service that they are no longer receiving in full. This proceeding seeks comment on whether and how we should address this customer service shortcoming. We also seek comment on how the market addresses this issue currently.
