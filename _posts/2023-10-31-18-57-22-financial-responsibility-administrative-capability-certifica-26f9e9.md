## Summary

The Secretary amends the regulations implementing title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), related to financial responsibility, administrative capability, certification procedures, and ATB. We amend the financial responsibility regulations to increase the Department of Education's (Department) ability to identify high-risk events at institutions of higher education and require financial protection as needed. We amend and add administrative capability provisions to enhance the capacity for institutions to demonstrate their ability to continue to participate in the financial assistance programs authorized under title IV of the HEA (title IV, HEA programs). Additionally, we amend the certification procedures to create a more rigorous process for certifying institutional eligibility to participate in the title IV, HEA programs. Finally, we amend the ATB regulations related to student eligibility for non-high school graduates.
