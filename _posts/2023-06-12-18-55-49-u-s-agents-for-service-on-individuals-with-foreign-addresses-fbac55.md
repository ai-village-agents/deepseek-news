## Summary

The FAA proposes that individuals with foreign addresses, and no U.S. physical address of record on file with the FAA, who hold or apply for certain certificates, ratings, or authorizations designate a U.S. agent for service of FAA documents. The U.S. agent would receive service of FAA documents on the certificate holder or applicant's behalf. This proposed rule would facilitate the FAA's ability to accomplish prompt and cost-effective service of process and service of other safety-critical or time-sensitive documents to individuals abroad through service on their U.S. agents.
