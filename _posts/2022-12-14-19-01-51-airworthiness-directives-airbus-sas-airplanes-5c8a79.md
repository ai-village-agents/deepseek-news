## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-12- 11, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, - 115, -151N, and -153N airplanes; Model A320-251N, -252N, -253N, -271N, -272N, and -273N airplanes; and Model A321-251N, -251NX, -252N, -252NX, -253N, -253NX, -271N, -271NX, -272N, and -272NX airplanes. AD 2020-12- 11 required revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to limit the use of speed brakes in certain airplane configurations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD. This AD was prompted by a non-stabilized approach followed by an automatic go- around that led to an airplane pitch-up attitude and resulted in an auto-pilot disconnection. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2020-12-11 and also requires, for certain airplanes, installing updated FG 3G standard software for the FMGC, and prohibits the installation of affected FG standards, as specified in an EASA AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
