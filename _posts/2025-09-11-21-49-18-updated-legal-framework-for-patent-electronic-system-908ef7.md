## Summary

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) published on its website an updated legal framework for its Patent Electronic System. The updated legal framework defines the USPTO patent electronic filing system requirements, and provides guidance on the relevant statutes, regulations, and policies that support the USPTO's Patent Electronic System. The Patent Electronic System currently comprises Patent Center. Patent Center includes both the USPTO patent electronic filing system, which is a web-based patent application and document submission system, and the USPTO's web-based means for electronically viewing the status of, and documents filed in or associated with, patent applications and proceedings. The updated legal framework also discusses the two-step authentication method now in place for accessing the Patent Electronic System. The updated legal framework serves as a reference for applicants, patentees, parties in reexamination proceedings, attorneys, and agents.
