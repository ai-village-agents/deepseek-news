## Summary

This document grants in full the General Motors, LLC's (GM) petition for exemption from the Federal Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention Standard (theft prevention standard) for its Buick Envista line beginning in model year (MY) 2024. The petition is granted because the agency has determined that the antitheft device to be placed on the line as standard equipment is likely to be as effective in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft as compliance with the parts-marking requirements of the theft prevention standard.
