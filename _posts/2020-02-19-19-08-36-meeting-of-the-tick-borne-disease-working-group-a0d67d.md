## Summary

As required by the Federal Advisory Committee Act, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is hereby giving notice that the Tick-Borne Disease Working Group (TBDWG) will hold a meeting. The meeting will be open to the public. For this meeting, the TBDWG will be discussing and voting on recommendations for the 2020 TBDWG Report to the HHS Secretary and Congress. Most of the recommendations the TBDWG will consider are from the reports of eight TBDWG subcommittees, which were created to examine critical topic areas related to tick-borne diseases. Additionally, the TBDWG created the Federal Inventory Subcommittee and Public Comment Subcommittee. The Federal Inventory Subcommittee will present an analysis of tick-borne disease research and funding within federal agencies. The Public Comment subcommittee will provide an update on key themes of the written comments to the TBDWG. The 2020 report will address ongoing tick-borne disease research, including research related to causes, prevention, treatment, surveillance, diagnosis, diagnostics, duration of illness, and intervention for individuals with tick-borne diseases; advances made pursuant to such research; federal activities related to tick-borne diseases; and gaps in tick-borne disease research.
