## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) published notice in the Federal Register on July 24, 2025, in which Commerce announced the final results of the 2022-2023 administrative review of the antidumping duty (AD) order on heavy-walled rectangular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes (HWR) from Mexico. This notice corrects the spelling of a non-examined company name that was inadvertently listed incorrectly as Acro Metal S.A. de C.V.
