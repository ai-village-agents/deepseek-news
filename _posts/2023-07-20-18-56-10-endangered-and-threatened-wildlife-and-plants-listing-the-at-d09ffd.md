## Summary

We, NMFS, published a proposed rule on April 7, 2023 to list the Atlantic humpback dolphin (Sousa teuszii) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in response to a petition from the Animal Welfare Institute, the Center for Biological Diversity, and VIVA Vaquita to list the species. Following publication of this proposed rule, NMFS became aware of cartographic guidance bulletin 38, issued by the Department of State's Office of the Geographer and Global Issues on December 16, 2020, and determined that the preamble to our proposed rule was not in alignment with the guidance. This correction removes all references to the name "Western Sahara" from the proposed rule's preamble and identifies Morocco as a country within the species' range, per the guidance. Additionally, this correction includes changes to the "International Regulatory Mechanisms" subsection of the proposed rule resulting from the inclusion of Morocco as a range country for the Atlantic humpback dolphin (S. teuszii). We are also reopening the public comment period for the proposed rule.
