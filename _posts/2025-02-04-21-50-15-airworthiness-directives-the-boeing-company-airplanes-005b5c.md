## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of operators receiving No. 1 flight compartment windows that may not meet type design requirements for withstanding a bird impact. This AD requires replacing affected No. 1 flight compartment windows and prohibits the installation of affected windows. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
