## Summary

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is issuing this advisory opinion to resolve regulatory uncertainty regarding: (1) the applicability of the definition of credit under Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), to earned wage access (EWA) products that conform to the description of "Covered EWA" provided in part I.C.2 of this advisory opinion; and (2) the applicability of the definition of finance charge under Regulation Z to certain EWA-related charges (expedited delivery fees, tips) to the extent any EWA products meet the Regulation Z definition of credit. The CFPB is also withdrawing a proposed interpretive rule.
