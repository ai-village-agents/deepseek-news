## Summary

This rule governs the management of surface resources and Special Areas in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (Reserve or NPR-A). The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages the NPR-A consistent with its duties under the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act, as amended (NPRPA), Federal Land Policy and Management Act, as amended, (FLPMA), and other authorities. The rule revises the framework for designating and assuring maximum protection of Special Areas' significant resource values and protects and enhances access for subsistence activities throughout the NPR-A. It also incorporates aspects of the NPR-A Integrated Activity Plan (IAP) approved in April 2022.
