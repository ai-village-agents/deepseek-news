## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Continental Aerospace Technologies, Inc. C-125, C145, IO-360, IO-470, IO-550, O-300, O-470, TSIO-360, TSIO-520 series model reciprocating engines and certain Continental Motors IO-520 series model reciprocating engines with a certain oil filter adapter installed. This AD was prompted by reports of two accidents that were the result of power loss due to oil starvation. This AD requires replacing the oil filter adapter fiber gasket (fiber gasket) with an oil filter adapter copper gasket (copper gasket). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
