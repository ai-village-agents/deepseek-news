## Summary

As part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, FinCEN invites comments on the proposed renewal, without change, of a currently approved information collection found in an existing Bank Secrecy Act regulation. Specifically, the regulation requires that upon receiving a written request from FinCEN, a U.S. bank that maintains a correspondent account for a specified foreign bank must ask the foreign bank, and report to FinCEN, about transactions or other financial services provided by that foreign bank to Iranian-linked financial institutions designated under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)-linked persons designated under IEEPA. This request for comments is made pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
