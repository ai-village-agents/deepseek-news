## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the State of Missouri for a regulation which limits the volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from batch process operations by incorporating reasonably available control technology (RACT) as required by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. This final action will amend the SIP to include adding incorporations by reference, including definitions specific to the rule, revising unnecessarily restrictive language, and making other administrative wording changes. The EPA's approval of these rule revisions is being done in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
