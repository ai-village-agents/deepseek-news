## Summary

NMFS has received a request from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) for a second re-issuance of a previously issued incidental harassment authorization (IHA), with the only change being the effective dates. The IHA authorizes take of seven species of marine mammals, by Level A and Level B harassment, incidental to construction associated with the Debris Dock Replacement Project in Sausalito, California. The ACOE has requested re-issuance with new effective dates of January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024. The scope of the activities and anticipated effects remain the same, authorized take numbers are not changed, and the required mitigation, monitoring, and reporting remains the same as included in the initial IHA. NMFS is, therefore, issuing an identical IHA to cover the incidental take analyzed and authorized in the initial IHA.
