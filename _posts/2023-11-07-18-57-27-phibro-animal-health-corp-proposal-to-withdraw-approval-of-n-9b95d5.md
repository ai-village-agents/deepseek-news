## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency), Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM), is proposing to withdraw approval of all new animal drug applications (NADAs) providing for use of carbadox in medicated swine feed, for which Phibro Animal Health Corp., Glenpointe Centre East, Third Floor, 300 Frank W. Burr Blvd., Suite 21, Teaneck, NJ 07666-6712, is the sponsor, and is announcing an opportunity for the holder of the NADAs to request a hearing on this proposal. This action is based on CVM's determination that there is no approved regulatory method to detect the residue of carcinogenic concern in the edible tissues of the treated swine.
