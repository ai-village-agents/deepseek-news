## Summary

On December 30, 2019, the Maritime Administration (MARAD) and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) announced the cancellation of all actions related to the processing of a license application for the proposed Texas COLT LLC deepwater port including cancellation of all activities related to the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement that was announced on Friday, March 8, 2019, in Federal Register Volume 84 Number 46 (Notice of Intent; Notice of Public Meeting; Request for Comments). The document inadvertently described the proposed Texas COLT LLC deepwater port as a liquified natural gas deepwater port facility. This document corrects the previous notice by describing the Texas COLT LLC deepwater port as an oil deepwater port facility.
