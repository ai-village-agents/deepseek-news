## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing an approval and a limited approval and limited disapproval of a revision to the Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District (MDAQMD or "District") portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). We are proposing approval of five rules and a limited approval and limited disapproval of five rules. These revisions concern the District's New Source Review (NSR) permitting program for new and modified sources of air pollution under part D of title I of the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act"). If finalized, this action will update the MDAQMD's current SIP with ten revised rules. We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
