## Summary

This action proposes special conditions for the Leonardo S.p.a. (Leonardo) Model AW139 helicopter. This helicopter as modified by The Boeing Company (Boeing) will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for helicopters. This design feature incorporates a 2.5-minute all engines operating (AEO) power restricted for use at helicopter operating speeds below 60 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS), and hovering out of ground effect (HOGE). This power is referred to as 2.5-minute HOGE utility power (HUP), or 2.5-minute HUP. The 2.5-minute HUP is greater than the transmission power limitations associated with takeoff and AEO. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These proposed special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
