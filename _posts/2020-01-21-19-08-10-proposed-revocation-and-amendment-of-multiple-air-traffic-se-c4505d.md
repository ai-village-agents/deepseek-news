## Summary

This action proposes to amend five VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways, V-4, V-53, V-115, V-119, and V-140; amend two low altitude Area Navigation (RNAV) routes, T-215 and T-323; and remove three VOR Federal airways, V-331, V-339, and V-478, in the vicinity of Newcombe, KY, and Hazard, KY. The Air Traffic Service (ATS) route modifications are necessary due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portions of the Newcombe, KY, VOR/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) and the Hazard, KY, VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) navigation aids (NAVAIDs). The NAVAIDs provide navigation guidance for portions of the affected air traffic service (ATS) routes. These VORs are being decommissioned as part of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
