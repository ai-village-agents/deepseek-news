## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) received and is considering approval of five amendment requests. The amendment requests are for Fermi 2; Oconee Nuclear Station, Units 1, 2, and 3; Center for Neutron Research Test Reactors; Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2; Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, Unit 2. For each amendment request, the NRC proposes to determine that it involves no significant hazards consideration. Because the amendment request contains sensitive unclassified non-safeguards information (SUNSI) and safeguards information (SGI) an order imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI and SGI for contention preparation.
