## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-26-13, which applies to certain Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (Sikorsky) Model S-92A helicopters. AD 2020-26-13 requires establishing the life limit for certain part-numbered horizontal stabilizer root fittings FWD (forward root fittings) and certain part-numbered stabilizer strut fittings. AD 2020-26-13 also requires repetitively inspecting certain parts, and depending on the inspection results, removing parts from service. Finally AD 2020-26-13 prohibits installing certain stabilizer assemblies on any helicopter. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-26-13, the manufacturer notified the FAA that due to an error in the service information, certain part numbers in AD 2020-26-13 are incorrect. Also, the FAA determined that additional inspections are required to address the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would retain certain requirements and the prohibition for installing certain stabilizer assemblies on any helicopter from AD 2020-26-13 and would correct certain part numbers and require additional repetitive inspections. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
