## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2024-24-02, which applies to all Safran Helicopter Engines, S.A. (Safran) Model ARRIUS 2F engines. AD 2024-24-02 requires removal of the affected fuel control unit (FCU) from service and replacement with a serviceable part. Since the FAA issued AD 2024-24-02, it was determined that certain serial numbers of the affected FCUs are not subject to the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would continue to require removal of the affected FCU from service and replacement with a serviceable part. This proposed AD would also reduce the number of affected FCUs. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
