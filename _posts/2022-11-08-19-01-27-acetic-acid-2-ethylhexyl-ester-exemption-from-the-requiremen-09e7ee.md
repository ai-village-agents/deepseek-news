## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of acetic acid, 2-ethylhexyl ester (CAS Reg. No. 103-09-3) when used as an inert ingredient (solvent/cosolvent) at a concentration not to exceed 50% in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops. SciReg, Inc., on behalf of Solvay USA Inc., submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of acetic acid, 2-ethylhexyl ester, when used in accordance with the terms of the exemption.
