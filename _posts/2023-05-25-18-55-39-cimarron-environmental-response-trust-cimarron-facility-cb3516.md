## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has received a license amendment application from Cimarron Environmental Response Trust (CERT or the applicant) for the Cimarron Facility, located in the city of Guthrie, which is in Logan County, Oklahoma. The license authorizes Possession of Byproduct, Source, and Special Nuclear Material (SNM-928). In this amendment request, CERT requests approval of its proposed Facility Decommissioning Plan (DP), Revision 3 for the Cimarron Facility. The requested license amendment is necessary for CERT to complete the remaining decommissioning activities needed for the NRC to release the Cimarron site for unrestricted use. The requested license amendment is also necessary to ultimately terminate SNM-928; however, license termination is a separate action that requires a separate application from CERT and a separate NRC finding that the site is suitable for release. Because the license application contains Sensitive Unclassified Non-Safeguards Information (SUNSI), an order imposes procedures to obtain access to this type of information for contention preparation.
