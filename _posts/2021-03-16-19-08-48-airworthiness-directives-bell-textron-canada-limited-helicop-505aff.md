## Summary

The FAA is superseding Emergency Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-05-52 which applied to certain Bell Textron Canada Limited (Bell) Model 505 helicopters. Emergency AD 2021-05-52 required a one-time visual inspection of the pilot collective stick and grip assembly (pilot collective stick), a fluorescent penetrant inspection (FPI) if no crack was found during the visual inspection, and depending on the inspection results, removing the pilot collective stick from service and reporting certain information to Bell. Emergency AD 2021-05-52 also prohibited installing any pilot collective stick on any helicopter unless the inspections had been accomplished. This AD removes the visual inspection of the pilot collective stick, requires repetitive FPIs of the pilot collective stick, and requires revising the existing Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) for your helicopter. This AD retains the reporting requirement and expands the prohibition. This AD was prompted by the determination that visual inspections do not adequately detect a crack and additional findings that a crack may occur sooner than previously expected. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
