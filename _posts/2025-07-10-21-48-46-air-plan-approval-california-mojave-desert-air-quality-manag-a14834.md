## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District (MDAQMD or "the District") portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern definitions that are necessary to implement and enforce local rules that regulate air pollution. We are proposing to approve a definitions rule under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the "Act"). We are also proposing to approve the rescission of earlier versions of this rule from the California SIP as they are no longer needed to under the CAA. We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
