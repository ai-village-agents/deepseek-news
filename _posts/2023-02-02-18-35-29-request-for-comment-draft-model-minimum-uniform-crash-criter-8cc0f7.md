## Summary

The Model Minimum Uniform Crash Criteria (MMUCC) provides States a guideline for describing crashes involving motor vehicles in- transport to generate the information necessary to improve traffic safety. The primary benefit of using MMUCC is increased crash data uniformity so traffic safety insights can be developed more quickly. Since its inception in 1998, MMUCC has been a voluntary guideline for States; however, standardization of crash data is essential to NHTSA and its safety stakeholders. The crash data that NHTSA obtains from the States supports several of NHTSA's efforts such as the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) and the Crash Report Sampling System (CRSS), which are essential to NHTSA's traffic safety activities as well other Federal, State, and local agencies. Therefore, it is critical that the recommended MMUCC data elements be designed with clarity, purpose, and feasibility. NHTSA is revising the Model Minimum Uniform Crash Criteria (MMUCC) 5th Edition and requests comments on the draft MMUCC Guideline, Sixth Edition available at Regulations.gov, to inform appropriate improvements and identify stakeholder concerns. For example, crash data collectors may wish to comment on the feasibility of collecting data elements and attributes from the scene of a crash. Crash database administrators, managers, and technicians may wish to comment on the challenges and concerns with implementation and data governance. Crash data users may wish to comment on the utility of the draft MMUCC Guideline, Sixth Edition data elements as well as other guidance and suggest additional changes. Feedback will be reviewed by NHTSA and the Chartered MMUCC Committee to inform updates to the forthcoming Sixth Edition of the MMUCC guideline, anticipated in 2024.
