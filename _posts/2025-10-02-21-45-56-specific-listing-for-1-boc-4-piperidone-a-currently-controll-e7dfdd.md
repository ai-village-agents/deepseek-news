## Summary

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is establishing a specific listing and DEA Chemical Code Number for tert-butyl 4- oxopiperidine-1-carboxylate (also known as 1-boc-4-piperidone; and CAS Number: 79099-07-3) and its salts as a list I chemical under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Although 1-boc-4-piperidone is not specifically listed as a list I chemical of the CSA with its own unique Chemical Code Number, it has been regulated as a list I chemical in the United States as a carbamate of 4-piperidone, a list I chemical, since May 12, 2023. Therefore, DEA is simply amending the list of list I chemicals in its regulations to separately include 1-boc-4-piperidone.
