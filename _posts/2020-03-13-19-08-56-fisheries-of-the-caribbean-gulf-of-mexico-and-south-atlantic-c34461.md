## Summary

NMFS announces the re-opening of the commercial longline component for golden tilefish in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the South Atlantic through this temporary rule. The most recent commercial longline landings data for golden tilefish indicate the commercial longline annual catch limit (ACL) for the 2020 fishing year has not yet been reached. Therefore, NMFS re-opens the commercial longline component for golden tilefish in the South Atlantic EEZ for 9 days to allow the commercial longline ACL to be caught while minimizing the risk of the commercial ACL being exceeded.
