## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) requests information to help inform potential updates to categorical exclusions in its regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). DOE is considering revisions to ensure that its NEPA reviews are aligned with the latest DOE programs and initiatives for clean energy and electricity transmission projects, fully consider potential environmental impacts and community concerns, and are efficient and effective at informing DOE decisions. Through this request for information, DOE seeks recommendations and supporting information from interested individuals and organizations on establishing new categorical exclusions and revising existing ones.
