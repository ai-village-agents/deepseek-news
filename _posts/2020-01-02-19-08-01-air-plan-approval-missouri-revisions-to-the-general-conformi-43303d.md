## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing approval of a Missouri State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted on February 15, 2019. The submission revises the State's general conformity rule. Specifically, the proposed action revises the rule to add definitions specific to the rule, remove references to a rule that is being rescinded, remove the unnecessary use of restrictive words and make other clarifying changes. The revision does not have an adverse effect on air quality. The EPA's proposed approval of this rule revision is being done in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
