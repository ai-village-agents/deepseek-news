## Summary

To avoid a gap in services to its service area between the end of BCHN's current period of performance and the next Service Area Competition (SAC), BCHN will receive a 3-month Extension with Funds to extend the end date of its period of performance from January 31, 2026, to April 30, 2026. BCHN currently has a period of performance ending on January 31, 2026. Extending BCHN's total period of performance to April 30, 2026, will prevent interruption in access to critical primary health care services in the community currently served by BCHN. Since there will be no SAC competition released for health centers with a period of performance end date of January 31, 2026, this extension will also permit BCHN to apply to the SAC application cycle for health centers with a period of performance end date of April 30, 2026.
