The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled "Non- Penicillin Beta-Lactam Drugs: A CGMP Framework for Preventing Cross- Contamination." This draft guidance describes methods, facility design elements, and controls that are important in preventing drugs from being cross-contaminated with non-penicillin beta-lactam antibacterial drugs or non-antibacterial beta-lactam compounds, and it makes recommendations for how manufacturers can be compliant with current good manufacturing practice requirements for preventing cross- contamination. This draft guidance also provides information regarding the relative health risk of, and the potential for, cross-reactivity in the classes of non-penicillin beta-lactam antibacterial drugs and non- antibacterial beta-lactam compounds. This draft guidance revises the guidance of the same title issued on April 17, 2013.
