## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model AS355E, AS355F, AS355F1, AS355F2, AS355N, and AS355NP helicopters. This AD was prompted by the identification of certain parts needing maintenance actions, including life limits and maintenance tasks. This AD requires incorporating into existing maintenance records requirements (airworthiness limitations), as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
