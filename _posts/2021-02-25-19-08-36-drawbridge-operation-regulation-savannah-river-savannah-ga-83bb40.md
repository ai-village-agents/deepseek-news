## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to modify the operating schedule that governs the Houlihan Bridge (US 17), across the Savannah River, mile 21.6, at Savannah, Georgia and the Seaboard System Railroad Bridge, across the Savannah River, mile 27.4, near Hardeeville, South Carolina. This proposed rule would increase the advance notification time for an opening at the bridges. The proposed rule would also update the name and geographic location of the bridges.
