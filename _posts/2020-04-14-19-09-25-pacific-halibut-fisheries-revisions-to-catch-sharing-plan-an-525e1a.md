## Summary

NMFS proposes regulations that would implement a "fish up" provision in the halibut and sablefish Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) Program to allow Community Quota Entities (CQEs) located in IFQ regulatory Area 3A (Southcentral Alaska) holding category D halibut quota share (QS) (i.e., for use on catcher vessel less than or equal to 35 ft (10.7 m) length overall) to have the associated IFQ harvested on category C vessels (catcher vessels less than or equal to 60 ft (18.3 m) length overall) beginning August 15 of each IFQ fishing season. This action would also make a minor change to regulations implementing the IFQ Program to consolidate temporary IFQ transfer forms. This proposed rule is intended to promote the goals and objectives of the Northern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982 and other applicable laws.
