## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-22- 03, AD 2023-13-10, and AD 2024-04-03, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A318, A319, A320, and A321 series airplanes. AD 2017-22-03, AD 2023-13-10, and AD 2024-04-03 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. This AD continues to require certain actions in AD 2023-13-10 and all actions in AD 2024-04- 03, and requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
