## Summary

The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) proposes to revise the regulations governing leasing of the Osage Nation's mineral estate ("Osage Mineral Estate") for oil and gas mining. The proposed rule would allow the BIA to strengthen management of the Osage Mineral Estate by updating bonding, royalty payment and reporting, production valuation and measurement, site security, and operational requirements to address changes in technology and industry standards that have occurred in the 47 years since the regulations were issued. The proposed rule would also allow the BIA to respond to recommendations made by the Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of the Interior (OIG).
