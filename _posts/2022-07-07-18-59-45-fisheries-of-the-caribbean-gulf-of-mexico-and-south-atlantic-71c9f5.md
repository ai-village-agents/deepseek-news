## Summary

NMFS implements an accountability measure for the commercial hook-and-line component of golden tilefish in the South Atlantic exclusive economic zone (EEZ). NMFS projects that commercial hook-and- line landings for golden tilefish will reach the commercial quota for the hook-and-line component by July 6, 2022. Therefore, NMFS closes the commercial hook-and-line component for golden tilefish in the South Atlantic EEZ on July 6, 2022. This closure is necessary to protect the golden tilefish resource.
