## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of zein (CAS Reg. No. 9010-66-6) when used as an inert ingredient (stabilizing agent) in pesticide formulations applied to animals. The United States Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA APHIS), submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of zein when used in accordance with the terms of the exemption.
