## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all LAVIA ARGENTINA S.A. (LAVIASA) Model PA-25, PA-25-235, and PA- 25-260 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of corrosion in the front and rear wing spars and cracks in the front wing spar. This proposed AD would require inspecting the front and rear wing spars for corrosion and crack(s); inspecting the upper/lower spar flange of the front wing spar for any crack(s); repairing or replacing front and rear wing spars if crack(s) or corrosion are found, as applicable. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
