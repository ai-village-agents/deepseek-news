## Summary

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act ("EPCA"), as amended, prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment, including commercial prerinse spray valves ("CPSVs") equipment. EPCA also requires the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE" or "the Department") to periodically determine whether more stringent, amended standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would result in significant energy savings. In this final determination, DOE has determined that amended energy conservation standards for commercial prerinse spray valves are not needed.
