## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-100-1A10 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive maintenance tasks are necessary. This proposed AD would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive maintenance tasks. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
