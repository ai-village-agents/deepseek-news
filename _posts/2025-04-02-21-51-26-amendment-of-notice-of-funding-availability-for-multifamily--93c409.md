## Summary

The Rural Housing Service (RHS or Agency), an agency within the United States Department of Agriculture, Rural Development (RD), is amending two program funding opportunities to remove references to the prior Administration's key priorities and DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion)-related scoring criteria to bring them into compliance with the Executive Order, "Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing", issued on January 20, 2025. The following funding notices are covered by this amendment: Notice of Funds Availability for the Multifamily Housing Preservation and Revitalization Demonstration Program and for Section 515 Subsequent Loans for Preservation Activities for the Fiscal Year 2024, and Consolidated Multifamily Housing Technical Assistance Grant Program Notice of Funding Availability Fiscal Year 2024. This notice also confirms that previous Administration key priorities will not be considered during application scoring and makes clear that applicants who already have applied need not reapply.
