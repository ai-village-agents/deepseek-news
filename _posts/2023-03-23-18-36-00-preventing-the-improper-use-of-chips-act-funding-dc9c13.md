## Summary

The CHIPS Act (the Act) established an incentives program to reestablish and sustain U.S. leadership across the semiconductor supply chain. To ensure that funding provided through this program does not directly or indirectly benefit foreign countries of concern, the Act includes certain limitations on funding recipients, such as prohibiting engagement in certain significant transactions involving the material expansion of semiconductor manufacturing capacity in foreign countries of concern and prohibiting certain joint research or technology licensing efforts with foreign entities of concern. The Department of Commerce (Department) is issuing, and requesting public comments on, a proposed rule to set forth terms related to these limitations and procedures for funding recipients to notify the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) of any planned significant transactions that may be prohibited.
