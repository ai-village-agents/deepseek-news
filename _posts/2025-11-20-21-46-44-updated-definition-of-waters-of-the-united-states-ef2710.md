## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Department of the Army ("the agencies") are publishing for public comment a proposed rule revising the regulations defining the scope of waters federally covered under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act, in light of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2023 decision in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency. With this proposed rule, the agencies intend to provide greater regulatory certainty and increase Clean Water Act program predictability and consistency by clarifying the definition of "waters of the United States." This proposed rule is also intended to implement the overall objective of the Clean Water Act to restore and maintain the quality of the Nation's waters while respecting State and Tribal authority over their own land and water resources.
