## Summary

This action supplements an earlier notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that DOT published on December 9, 2024. This supplemental proposal would update terminology in DOT's drug and alcohol testing regulations consistent with Executive Order 14168 (E.O. 14168), Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government. DOT continues to propose a provision to require a directly observed urine collection in situations where oral fluid tests are currently required, but oral fluid testing is not yet available.
