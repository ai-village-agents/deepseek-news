## Summary

The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is announcing a fee to be collected by USCIS. The EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022 (the 2022 Act) requires USCIS to establish a special fund to be known as the EB-5 Integrity Fund to be primarily used by USCIS in the administration of the Regional Center Program. USCIS must collect a fee of $20,000 or $10,000, depending on certain factors established by the 2022 Act, to finance the EB-5 Integrity Fund from each designated regional center. This notice explains how regional centers should determine the amount of the fee and provides the process for how it is to be paid.
