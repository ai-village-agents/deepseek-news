## Summary

Section 1042 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) generally authorizes States to enforce the CFPA's provisions. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) is issuing this interpretive rule to provide further clarity regarding the scope of State enforcement under section 1042 and related provisions of the CFPA. Specifically, the Bureau is issuing the following interpretations: Section 1042 allows States to enforce any provision of the CFPA, including section 1036(a)(1)(A), a provision that makes it unlawful for covered persons or service providers to violate the Federal consumer financial laws; the limitations on the Bureau's authority in sections 1027 and 1029 generally do not constrain States' enforcement authority under section 1042; and section 1042 does not restrict States from bringing concurrent enforcement actions with the Bureau.
