## Summary

On May 13, 2022, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) published an interim final rule that appeared in the Federal Register and that amended the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS) regulations. That rule was published with a 30-day comment period, which ended on June 13, 2022, and a 45-day delayed effective date (June 27, 2022). A subsequent notice delaying the effective date until September 26, 2022, was published on June 24, 2022. This action further delays the effective date of the interim final rule by an additional 120 days, until January 24, 2023.
