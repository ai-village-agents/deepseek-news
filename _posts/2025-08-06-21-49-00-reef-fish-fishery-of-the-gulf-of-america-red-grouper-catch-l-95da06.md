## Summary

NMFS issues this final temporary rule to promulgate emergency measures, due to recently discovered circumstances to mitigate harmful economic conditions to red grouper fishermen in the Gulf of America (Gulf). As requested by the Gulf Council (Council), NMFS issues this final temporary rule to increase the Gulf red grouper catch limits for the remainder of the 2025 fishing year. The purpose of this emergency action is to allow for increased harvest opportunities in the commercial and recreational sectors, particularly by extending the recreational fishing season and increasing the revenue potential for commercial and charter vessel/headboat (for-hire) fishermen targeting red grouper.
