## Summary

The Employment and Training Administration of the Department of Labor (DOL) is issuing this notice to announce the 2024 Adverse Effect Wage Rates (AEWR) for the employment of temporary or seasonal nonimmigrant foreign workers (H-2A workers) to perform agricultural labor or services other than the herding or production of livestock on the range. AEWRs are the minimum wage rates the DOL has determined must be offered, advertised in recruitment, and paid by employers to H-2A workers and workers in corresponding employment so that the wages and working conditions of workers in the United States (U.S.) similarly employed will not be adversely affected. The AEWRs established in this notice are applicable to H-2A job opportunities that are both: classified in one (or more) of the six Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) codes comprising the field and livestock workers (combined) category, and located in States or regions, or equivalent districts or territories, in which the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Farm Labor Report (better known as the Farm Labor Survey, or FLS) reports wages. In this notice, DOL also announces an update to the average AEWR, which is used to calculate adjustments to required bond amounts for H-2A Labor Contractors.
