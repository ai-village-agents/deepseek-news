## Summary

On August 20, 2020, HUD issued a notice providing for the program rules, statutory and regulatory waivers, and alternative requirements applicable to supplemental Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds made available to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus (CDBG-CV funds) and to annual formula CDBG grants awarded in fiscal years 2019 and 2020. This notice describes a change to one of the regulatory waivers and alternative requirements applicable to the CDBG-CV funds. The change removes the requirement that eighty percent of a grant must be expended within three years of grant agreement execution. Except as otherwise described in this notice, the August 2020 Notice, the CARES Act, and the statutory and regulatory provisions governing the CDBG program continue to apply to CDBG-CV funds.
