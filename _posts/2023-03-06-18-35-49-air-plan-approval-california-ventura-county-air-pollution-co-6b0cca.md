## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a revision to the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (VCAPCD) portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). This revision concerns emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from architectural coating operations. We are approving a local rule to regulate these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act). Approval of the local rule as part of the California SIP makes it federally enforceable.
