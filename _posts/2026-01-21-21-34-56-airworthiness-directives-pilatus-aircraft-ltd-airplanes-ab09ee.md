## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Pilatus Aircraft Ltd. (Pilatus) Model PC-12 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that the emergency exit door could not be opened from inside an airplane. This proposed AD would require a visual inspection of the passenger service unit (PSU) trim panel for dual lock fastener tapes and modification if dual lock fastener tapes are not installed. This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
