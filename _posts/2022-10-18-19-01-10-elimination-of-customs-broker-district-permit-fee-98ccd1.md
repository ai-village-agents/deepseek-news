## Summary

This document amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regulations to eliminate customs broker district permit fees. Concurrently with this final rule, CBP is publishing a final rule to, among other things, eliminate customs broker districts (see "Modernization of the Customs Broker Regulations" RIN 1651-AB16). Specifically, CBP is transitioning all brokers to national permits and expanding the scope of the national permit authority to allow national permit holders to conduct any type of customs business throughout the customs territory of the United States. As a result of the elimination of customs broker districts, CBP is amending in this document the regulations to eliminate customs broker district permit fees.
