## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 737-100, -200, -200C, -300, -400, and -500 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report indicating cracks in the frame inner chord and web at station (STA) 727. This AD requires an inspection for any repair installed, repetitive inspections of the frame inner chord and web at STA 727 for any crack, and applicable on- condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
