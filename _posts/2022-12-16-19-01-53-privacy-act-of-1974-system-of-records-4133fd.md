## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the DoD is modifying, renumbering, and renaming a Department-wide system of records titled DoD DPR-39, "DoD Personnel Accountability and Assessment System." This system of records is being modified to support additional information systems being established within the DoD using the same categories of data for the same purposes. The system number is changing from DPR-39 to DoD-0012, to reflect its status as a DoD-wide system of records, and the name is changing from "DoD Personnel Accountability and Assessment System" to "Defense Accountability and Assessment Records." The DoD is also modifying numerous sections of the notice, including the system location, system managers, authority for maintenance of the system, purpose of the system, individuals covered by the system, record source categories, routine uses, and notification procedures. This system of records covers DoD's maintenance of records about accountability for and status of DoD-affiliated individuals, including Military Service members, civilian employees, dependents and family members, contractors, and other DoD-affiliated personnel (including individuals in other uniformed services performing DoD-related assignments) in a natural or man-made disaster, public health emergency, similar crisis, or when directed by the Secretary of Defense. This system may also apply to DoD's maintenance of records about DoD-affiliated individuals that are necessary to respond to anomalous health incidents (AHIs), such as AHIs contemplated by two sections of the National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2022, when such records are not covered by another system, such as EDHA 07, Military Health Information System (June 15, 2020). Additionally, DoD is issuing a direct final rule, which is exempting this system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act, elsewhere in today's issue of the Federal Register.
