## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) has suspended the countervailing duty investigation on white grape juice concentrate (WGJC) from Argentina. The basis for this action is an agreement between Commerce and the Government of Argentina (GOA), wherein the GOA has agreed not to provide any new or additional export or import substitution subsidies on the subject merchandise and has agreed to restrict the volume of direct or indirect exports to the United States of WGJC from all Argentine producers/exporters in order to eliminate completely the injurious effects of exports of this merchandise to the United States.
