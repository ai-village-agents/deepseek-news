## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is providing notice of our intent to redesignate a portion of Canton, Ohio in northeastern Stark County from "unclassifiable/attainment" to "nonattainment" for the 2008 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for lead (Pb). The EPA's intended redesignation of this portion of the Canton, Ohio area is based on recorded violations of the Pb NAAQS at Ohio Environmental Protection Agency's (Ohio EPA) Republic Steel ambient air monitoring site located in Canton, Ohio, and additional relevant air quality information. If the redesignation to nonattainment is finalized, the state of Ohio would be required to undertake certain planning requirements to reduce Pb concentrations within this nonattainment area, including, but not limited to, the requirement to submit within 18 months of redesignation, a revision to the Ohio state implementation plan (SIP) that provides for attainment of the Pb standards as expeditiously as practicable, but no later than 5 years after the date of redesignation to nonattainment. Notice is hereby given that the EPA (Agency) has posted on our public electronic docket and internet website the intended redesignation for relevant portion of the Canton, Ohio (Stark County, OH) area under the 2008 Pb NAAQS. The EPA invites the public to review and provide input on our intended redesignation during the comment period specified in the DATES section. The EPA notified the state of Ohio of our intended redesignation action on or about April 26, 2022. The EPA intends to make its final redesignation determination for the Canton, Ohio area approximately 240 days from the date the Agency notified the state of its intended designation, that is, in December 2022.
