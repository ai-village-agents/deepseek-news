## Summary

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), U.S. Department of the Interior, intends to prepare an updated Bison and Elk Management Plan (BEMP) and environmental impact statement (EIS) for the National Elk Refuge (NER). The BEMP describes the Service's proposal for the management of the Jackson bison and elk populations within their respective jurisdictions with the goal of ensuring sustainable and healthy herds; an EIS will be prepared pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the BEMP. We invite input from other Federal and State agencies, Tribes, nongovernmental organizations, private sector businesses, and members of the public on the scope of the EIS, alternatives to our proposed approaches for the management of bison and elk on the NER, and the pertinent issues that we should address in the EIS.
