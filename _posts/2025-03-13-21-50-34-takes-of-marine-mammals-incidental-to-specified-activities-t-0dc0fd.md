## Summary

NMFS has received a request from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) on behalf of the United States Air Force Pacific Air Forces Regional Support Center (USAF) for an incidental harassment authorization (IHA) that is nearly identical to an IHA previously issued to USAF authorizing the take of marine mammals, by Level A and Level B harassment, incidental to the Eareckson Air Station (EAS) Fuel Pier Repair project in Alcan Harbor on Shemya Island, Alaska. Pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), NMFS is requesting comments on its proposal to issue an IHA to incidentally take marine mammals during the Eareckson Fuel Pier Repair project. NMFS is also requesting comments on a possible 1-year renewal IHA that could be issued under certain circumstances and if all requirements are met, as described in Request for Public Comments at the end of this notice. NMFS will consider public comments prior to making any final decision on the issuance of the requested MMPA authorizations and agency responses will be summarized in the final notice of our decision. The IHA would be valid for one year from the effective date.
