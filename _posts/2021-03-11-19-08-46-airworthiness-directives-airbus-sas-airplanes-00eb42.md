# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus SAS Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A330-200, A330-300, A340-200, A340-300, A340-500, and A340-600 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports that, for certain lower deck mobile crew rest (LDMCR) units, the connection of a certain halon outlet tube to the outlet of a certain fire extinguisher bottle may be incorrect. This proposed AD would require replacing each affected halon outlet tube with a flexible hose, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
