## Summary

Under this proposed rule, when tenants who reside in public housing or in properties receiving project-based rental assistance (PBRA) face eviction for nonpayment of rent, public housing agencies (PHAs) and owners would need to provide those tenants with written notification at least 30 days prior to the commencement of a formal judicial eviction procedure for lease termination. For purposes of this proposed rule, PBRA includes projects in the following programs: Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance, Section 202/162 Project Assistance Contract, Section 202 Project Rental Assistance Contract (PRAC), Section 811 PRAC, Section 811 Project Rental Assistance Program (811 PRA), and Senior Preservation Rental Assistance Contract Projects (SPRAC). This proposed rule would curtail preventable and unnecessary evictions by providing tenants with time and information to help cure nonpayment violations.
