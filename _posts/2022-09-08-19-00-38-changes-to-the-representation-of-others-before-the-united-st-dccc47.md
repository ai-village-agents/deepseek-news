## Summary

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO or Office) proposes to amend the rules of practice in patent cases and the rules regarding the representation of others before the USPTO to better protect the public and improve compliance with USPTO requirements. In particular, this rulemaking proposes to formalize the USPTO's Diversion Pilot Program for patent and trademark practitioners whose physical or mental health issues or law practice management issues resulted in minor misconduct. Formalizing the Pilot would align USPTO disciplinary practice with a majority of states and provide practitioners an opportunity to address the root causes of such misconduct. In addition, the USPTO proposes to require foreign attorneys or agents granted reciprocal recognition in trademark matters to provide and update their contact and status information or have their recognition withdrawn so the public will have access to up-to-date information. Also, the USPTO proposes to defer to state bars regarding fee sharing between practitioners and non-practitioners to reduce the potential for conflicts between USPTO and state bar rules. Further, the USPTO proposes to remove a fee required when changing one's status from a patent agent to a patent attorney and to make minor adjustments to other rules related to the representation of others before the USPTO.
