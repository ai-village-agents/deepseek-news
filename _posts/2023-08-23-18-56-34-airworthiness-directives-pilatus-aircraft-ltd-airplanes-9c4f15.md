## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Pilatus Aircraft Ltd. (Pilatus) Model PC-24 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of an electrical burning smell in the cabin without the presence of smoke. This AD requires revising the Limitations Section of the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) for your airplane, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
