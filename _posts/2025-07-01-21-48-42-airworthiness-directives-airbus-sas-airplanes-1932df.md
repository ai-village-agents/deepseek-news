## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that the applicable aircraft flight manual (AFM) was providing an incorrect value for maximum cumulative taxi time in freezing fog conditions. This AD requires revising the existing AFM to provide the flightcrew with normal procedures to follow under certain conditions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
