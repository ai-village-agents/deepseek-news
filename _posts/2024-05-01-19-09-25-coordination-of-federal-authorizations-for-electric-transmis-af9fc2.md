## Summary

The Department of Energy (DOE) is amending its regulations for the timely coordination of Federal authorizations for proposed interstate electric transmission facilities pursuant to the Federal Power Act (FPA). Specifically, DOE is establishing an integrated and comprehensive Coordinated Interagency Transmission Authorizations and Permits Program (CITAP Program); making participation in the Integrated Interagency Pre-Application (IIP) Process a pre-condition for assistance under the CITAP Program; re-establishing the IIP Process as an iterative and collaborative process between the proponent of a proposed electric transmission project and Federal and State agencies to develop information needed for Federal authorizations; requiring the project proponent to engage in robust engagement with the public, communities of interest, and Indian Tribes during the IIP Process; aligning and harmonizing the IIP Process and implementation of the FPA with the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act; and ensuring that DOE may carry out its statutory obligation to prepare a single environmental review document sufficient for the purposes of all Federal authorizations necessary to site a proposed project.
