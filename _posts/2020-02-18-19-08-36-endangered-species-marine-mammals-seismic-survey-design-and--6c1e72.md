## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, announce the availability of a peer-reviewed scientific manuscript and associated model regarding seismic survey design and potential impacts to maternal polar bear dens. This manuscript contains information, including a methodology and model that may be used for evaluating the effects of future seismic survey proposals for their potential impacts to maternal polar bear dens. We are also announcing public webinars that will provide an overview of the manuscript and model and respond to questions. We request public comments on the value of the model and the associated methodology described in the peer-viewed scientific manuscript in assisting in the evaluation of the effects of future seismic survey proposals for their potential impacts to maternal polar bear dens.
