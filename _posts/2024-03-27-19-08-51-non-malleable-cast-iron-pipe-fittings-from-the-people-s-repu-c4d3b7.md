## Summary

On March 11, 2024, the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT or Court) issued its final judgment in MCC Holdings dba Crane Resistoflex v. United States and ASC Engineered Solutions LLC., Court No. 18-00248, Slip Op. 24-30 (CIT March 11, 2024) (Crane Slip Op. 24- 28), sustaining the final remand results of the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce), pertaining to the final scope ruling on certain non-malleable cast iron pipe fittings (pipe fittings) from the People's Republic of China (China). Commerce is therefore amending its Final Scope Ruling to find that ductile iron flanges exported by MCC Holdings dba Crane Resistoflex (Crane) are not within the scope of the antidumping (AD) order on pipe fittings from China. Commerce is also notifying the public that the CIT's final judgment is not in harmony with the Final Scope Ruling.
