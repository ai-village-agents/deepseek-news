## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of acetophenone when used as an inert ingredient (solvent or co-solvent) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops. ADAMA Makhteshim Ltd. submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting the establishment of this exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of acetophenone, when used in accordance with the terms of that exemption.
