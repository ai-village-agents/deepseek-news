## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A330-800 and A330-900 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a protective cap found still in place on the drain hole of a fire extinguishing pipe, and by further investigations indicating these caps may have remained on other airplanes. This proposed AD would require a one-time general visual inspection (GVI) of the engine fire extinguishing pipe drain hole and, depending on findings, removal of the protective cap, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
