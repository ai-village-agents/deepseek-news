## Summary

This action increases the possession and trip limits of Gulf of Maine cod, Cape Cod/Gulf of Maine yellowtail flounder, and witch flounder for Northeast multispecies common pool vessels for the remainder of the 2021 fishing year. This action will provide the common pool fishery greater opportunity to harvest, but not exceed, the annual quotas for these stocks.
