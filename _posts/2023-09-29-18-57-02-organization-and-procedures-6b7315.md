## Summary

The Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB or the Board) is launching an updated electronic filing (e-filing) system, e-Appeal, on October 2, 2023, in support of MSPB's agency-wide initiative to modernize its technology, gain new efficiencies, and improve the e- filing experience for our external users. MSPB hereby amends its rules of practice and procedure to require all pleadings filed by agencies and attorneys who represent appellants in MSPB proceedings to be electronically filed (e-filed). This requirement will apply to all pleadings in all adjudicatory proceedings before the Board except those specifically excluded by this interim final rule.
