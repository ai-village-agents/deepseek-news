## Summary

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) requests public comment on an application for a five year exemption received from Emergency Safety Solutions (ESS or Applicant). Specifically, ESS seeks an exemption from certain Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) related to requirements for placing warning devices around a stopped commercial motor vehicle (CMV), requirements that exterior lamps be steady burning, and requirements that specific types of warning devices be used. The exemption would allow CMVs to operate with a module manufactured by ESS which pulses the rear clearance, identification, and brake lamps from a standard lower level lighting intensity (1-2 Hertz) to a higher-level lighting intensity (4- 5 Hertz) when activated during emergency stops or breakdowns. FMCSA requests public comment on Applicant's request for exemption.
