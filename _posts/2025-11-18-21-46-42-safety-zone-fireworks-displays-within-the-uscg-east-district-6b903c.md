## Summary

The Coast Guard will enforce a safety zone for a fireworks display at "The Wharf DC," in Washington, DC, to provide for the safety of life on navigable waterways during this event. Our regulation for recurring safety zones for fireworks displays within the USCG East District identifies the precise location. During the enforcement period, vessels may not enter, remain in, or transit through the safety zone unless authorized to do so by the COTP or his representative, and vessels in the vicinity must comply with directions from the Patrol Commander or any Official Patrol displaying a Coast Guard ensign.
