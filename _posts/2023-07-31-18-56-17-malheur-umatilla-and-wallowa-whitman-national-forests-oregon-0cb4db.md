## Summary

The Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, is initiating the Land Management Plan revision process for the Malheur, Umatilla, and Wallowa-Whitman National Forests (Blue Mountains Forests), located in northeast Oregon and southeast Washington. This process will result in three revised Land Management Plans to guide all resource management activities on the Blue Mountains Forests for approximately fifteen years. This notice announces the initiation of the assessment phase, the preliminary stage of the plan revision process. Assessments will identify and consider relevant and readily accessible material about ecological, social, and economic conditions and trends in the planning area, including best available scientific information. Findings will be documented in an assessment report. Trends and conditions identified in the assessment will help describe a need to change the existing plans and inform the revision of the three Land Management Plans.
