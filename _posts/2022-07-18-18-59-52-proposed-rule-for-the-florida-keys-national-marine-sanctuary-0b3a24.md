## Summary

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is proposing several changes to the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) to expand the boundary of the sanctuary, update sanctuary-wide regulations, update the individual marine zones and their associated regulations, and revise the sanctuary's terms of designation. In addition, a revised draft management plan is included in the supporting material for this proposed rule. FKNMS currently protects 3,800 square miles of waters surrounding the Florida Keys, from south of Miami westward to the Dry Tortugas. Within the boundaries of the sanctuary lie spectacular, unique, and nationally significant marine resources including North America's only coral barrier reef, extensive seagrass beds, mangrove-fringed islands, and more than 6,000 species of marine life. The sanctuary also protects pieces of our Nation's history such as shipwrecks and other archeological resources. This proposed rule follows NOAA's publication of a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) in August 2019, also referred to as the Restoration Blueprint, which included a range of alternatives. The proposed rule is necessary to improve the condition of resources in the Florida Keys through a series of regulatory measures designed to reduce threats and, where appropriate, restore coral reefs, seagrasses, and other important habitats. The intended effect of this proposed rule is to protect and preserve the living and heritage resources of the Florida Keys for the benefit of the public. NOAA is soliciting public comment on this proposed rule.
