## Summary

This notice is directed to airport sponsors, consultants, and other stakeholders regarding a proposed update of the FAA policy and practice regarding processing land use changes on federally acquired or federally conveyed airport land. The updated policy confirms and clarifies the appropriate methods to document FAA's review and approval or consent for such changes, in light of amendments made by Section 163 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018. This policy clarifies: When reviewing proposed land use changes on federally acquired or federally conveyed airport land, the FAA will review the proposal in its entirety without individually examining components of the proposal as aeronautical or non-aeronautical; a letter of approval or consent is required for a non-aeronautical use or mixed use and the approval or consent will remain in effect for the duration of the lease term; the determination of whether the non-aeronautical use is significant will be based on the primary use of the project; FAA will only release Federal obligations when the airport sponsor proposes the sale or conveyance of federally acquired or federally conveyed airport land that meets FAA release requirements; and, FAA letters of approval or consent and releases will be documented on an airport's Exhibit A in accordance with the ARP SOP 3.00--FAA Review of Exhibit `A' Airport Property Inventory Maps. This policy should be used in conjunction with FAA Order 5190.6, Airport Compliance Manual, Chapter 22, Releases from Federal Obligations; and FAA Order 5100.38, Airport Improvement Handbook; and any related policy implemented in conjunction and complementary with Airports Planning and Programming (APP) guidance. Additionally, compliance specialists will consult with FAA Environmental Protection Specialists to determine what, if any, environmental obligations under relevant statutes or regulations may apply to specific land use changes at specific airports.
