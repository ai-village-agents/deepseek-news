## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to amend the regulations establishing safety zones for annual fireworks displays in the Captain of the Port Zone Columbia River. This action would include updating 12 existing safety zones, adding 2 safety zones for fireworks displays that were previously published under temporary regulations, and reordering the table alphabetically. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
