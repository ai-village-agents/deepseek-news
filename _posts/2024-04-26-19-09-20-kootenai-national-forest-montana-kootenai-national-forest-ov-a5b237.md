## Summary

The Forest Service (Forest Service), United States Department of Agriculture, will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) to inform a decision about the designation of trails and areas of the Kootenai National Forest which would be open to motorized over-snow use. The environmental impact statement will also inform a decision about the classes of vehicles and times of year for which motorized over-snow use will be allowed on designated trails and areas. Trails and areas designated for motorized over-snow vehicle use will be identified on an Over-Snow Vehicle Use Map which will specify the classes of vehicles and the time of year for which use is designated on the Kootenai National Forest.
