## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve the May 13, 2020 revisions to the Texas State Implementation Plan (SIP) concerning Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) requirement for the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB), 2008 8-hour ozone National Air Quality Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) nonattainment area (NA). The HGB area, designated as serious for 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS, consists of Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery and Waller counties. The RACT requirements apply to sources of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) and Oxides of Nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) in this area. We are also proposing to approve negative declarations for certain VOC source categories subject to RACT in the HGB area.
