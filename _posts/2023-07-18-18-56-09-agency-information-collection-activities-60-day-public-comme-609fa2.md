## Summary

As part of our continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, and as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the Federal Maritime Commission (Commission) invites comments on the information collection related to Licensing, Financial Responsibility Requirements and General Duties for Ocean Transportation Intermediaries and Related Forms. This notice announces a renewal of an existing collection and includes a minor update to the collection based on an increase in the number of entities required to respond.
