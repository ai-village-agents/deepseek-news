## Summary

NMFS is closing the commercial Atlantic mackerel fishery through December 31, 2025. This closure is required by regulation because NMFS projects that 80 percent of the mackerel domestic annual harvest has been harvested. This action is necessary to comply with the regulations implementing the Mackerel, Squid, and Butterfish Fishery Management Plan and is intended to prevent overharvest of Atlantic mackerel.
