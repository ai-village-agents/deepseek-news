## Summary

The U.S. Department of Agriculture is amending its administrative regulations by removing the procedural regulations for the review and issuance of agency guidance documents.

This final rule implements the direction in section 3 of E.O. 13992 to rescind any regulations that were issued to implement or enforce E.O. 13891.
