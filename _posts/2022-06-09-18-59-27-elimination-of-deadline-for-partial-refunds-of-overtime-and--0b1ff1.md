## Summary

On July 15, 2021, the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced in the Federal Register that, while funding is available, it will reduce overtime and holiday inspection fees for small and very small establishments. In the notice, FSIS stated that small and very small establishments need to submit an Overtime/Holiday Rate Reduction form to request an overtime or holiday inspection fee reduction. FSIS also explained that establishments that submit their forms by March 11, 2022, and that qualify for a fee reduction, would receive a partial refund for overtime and holiday inspection fees paid since October 11, 2020, i.e., the first day of the pay period after the beginning of Fiscal Year 2021. FSIS is eliminating the March 11, 2022, deadline for partial refunds. Therefore, all establishments that qualify and submit their forms will be eligible to receive the partial refund for overtime and holiday fees paid since October 11, 2020, while funding is available.
