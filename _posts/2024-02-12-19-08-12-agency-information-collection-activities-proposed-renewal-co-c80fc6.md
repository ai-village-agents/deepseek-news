## Summary

As part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, FinCEN invites comment on a renewal, without change, of existing information collection requirements relating to reports of suspicious transactions. Under Bank Secrecy Act regulations, financial institutions are required to report suspicious transactions using FinCEN Form 111 (the suspicious activity report, or SAR). This request for comments is made pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA).
