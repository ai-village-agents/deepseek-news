## Summary

The Rules of Practice for Adjudication Proceedings (Rules of Practice) govern adjudication proceedings conducted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau). The Bureau issued a procedural rule to update the Rules of Practice (Updated Rules of Practice). The Updated Rules of Practice expanded the opportunities for parties in adjudication proceedings to conduct depositions. They also made amendments concerning timing and deadlines, the content of answers, the scheduling conference, bifurcation of proceedings, the process for deciding dispositive motions, and requirements for issue exhaustion, as well as other technical changes. The Bureau sought to provide the parties with earlier access to relevant information and also foster greater procedural flexibility, which the Bureau expected would ultimately contribute to more effective and efficient proceedings. The Bureau invited the public to submit comments on the Updated Rules of Practice. After considering the comments, the Bureau has decided to retain the amendments.
