## Summary

This regulation establishes a temporary exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of Ledprona (CAS# 2433753-68-3) in or on potatoes when used in accordance with the terms of Experimental Use Permit (EUP) No. 94614-EUP-1. GreenLight Bioscience, Inc. submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) for a temporary exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of Ledprona on all raw agricultural products and food products. After reviewing the petition and supporting data, the Agency has limited the temporary tolerance exemption to residues of Ledprona on potatoes only. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of Ledprona in or on potatoes. This temporary tolerance exemption expires on April 30, 2025.
