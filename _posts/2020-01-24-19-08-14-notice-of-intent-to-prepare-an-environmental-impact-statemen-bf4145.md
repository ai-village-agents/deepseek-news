## Summary

Pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as implemented by the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations, the Department of the Navy (Navy) announces its intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to evaluate the potential environmental effects associated with revitalization of the Navy Old Town Campus (OTC) to support Naval Information Warfare Systems Command's (NAVWAR) current and future operational readiness. This EIS will also address provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) as it relates to non- federal development within the proposed alternatives. An EIS is considered the appropriate document for comprehensively analyzing the proposed action to demolish and construct buildings, utilities, and infrastructure at the OTC, Naval Base Point Loma, California. Specific proposed actions within the OTC proposal could include Navy recapitalization of the site or redevelopment through a public-private partnership.
