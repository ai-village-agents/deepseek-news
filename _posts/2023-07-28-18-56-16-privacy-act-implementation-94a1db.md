## Summary

HHS exempts certain records in an existing system of records maintained by OCSE within ACF from the accounting, access, and amendment requirements of the Privacy Act. The affected system of records is OCSE Federal Case Registry of Child Support Orders, HHS/ACF/ OCSE, System No. 09-80-0385. Only case files marked with the Family Violence Indicator (FVI) will be exempted, to align with a restriction in section 453(b)(2) of the Social Security Act which prohibits disclosure of case files marked with the FVI to anyone other than a court or agent of a court, to avoid harm to the custodial parent or the child of such parent.
