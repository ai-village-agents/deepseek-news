## Summary

To address America's skills gap and to rapidly increase the availability of high-quality apprenticeship programs in sectors where apprenticeship opportunities are not widespread, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL or the Department) is issuing this final rule under the authority of the National Apprenticeship Act (NAA). This final rule establishes a process for the DOL's Office of Apprenticeship (OA) Administrator (Administrator), or any person designated by the Administrator, to recognize qualified third-party entities, known as Standards Recognition Entities (SREs), which will, in turn, evaluate and recognize Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs (IRAPs). This final rule describes what entities may become recognized SREs; outlines the responsibilities and requirements for SREs, as well as the standards of the high-quality Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs the SREs will recognize; and sets forth how the Administrator will oversee SREs.
