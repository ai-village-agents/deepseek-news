# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model AS332L2 and EC225LP helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a discrepancy in the rotorcraft flight manual (RFM) where the rotorcraft stay-up flying capabilities for Category B operation were provided through performance data only, not as airworthiness limitations that are dependent upon on the number of passengers on board. This proposed AD would require revising the existing RFM for your helicopter, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
