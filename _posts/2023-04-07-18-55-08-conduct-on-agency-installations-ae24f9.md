## Summary

The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is amending its installation security regulations to include Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) property in the definition of Agency installation, which reflects the Agency's authority to provide security on ODNI installations. The CIA is also removing the exemption for Federal officials or members of the Armed Forces from its prohibition on carrying weapons on Agency installations, except when such persons are either authorized by the CIA Director of Security or otherwise authorized by law for the performance of official law enforcement duties. This amendment also revises the definition of weapon to permit small amounts of irritant gas on Agency installations and revises the penalties provision to clarify that the penalty for a violation of these regulations is up to a Class C misdemeanor.
