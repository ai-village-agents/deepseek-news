## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission or Agency) is modifying an existing system of records, FCC/WCB-1, Lifeline Program, subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. This action is necessary to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act to publish in the Federal Register notice of the existence and character of records maintained by the agency. The Lifeline Program (or "Lifeline") provides discounts for one Lifeline Program telephone per household (voice telephony) and broadband internet access service (BIAS) to qualifying low-income individuals. Individuals may qualify for Lifeline through proof of income or participation in another qualifying program. Since the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (1996 Act), the Lifeline Program has been administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) under the direction of the Commission and, by delegation, of the Commission's Wireline Competition Bureau (WCB). This system of records contains information about individuals who have applied to participate in the Lifeline Program, respondents to consumer surveys related to the Lifeline program, and enrollment representatives. The modifications described in this notice will allow USAC to maintain and administer this system in a manner that promotes efficiency and minimizes waste, fraud, and abuse.
