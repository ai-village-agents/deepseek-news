## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 97-06-10 for certain Raytheon Aircraft Company (type certificate now held by Textron Aviation Inc. (Textron)) Model 76 airplanes. AD 97-06-10 required repetitively inspecting the main landing gear (MLG) "A" frame assemblies for cracks and replacing any cracked assembly. Since the FAA issued AD 97-06-10, the replacement parts have also experienced failure due to cracking. This AD requires magnetic particle inspections of the MLG "A" frame assemblies for cracks and replacement of the affected parts if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
