## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2013-05-13, which applies to certain Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) BR700-710 series turbofan engines. AD 2013-05-13 requires replacing the affected fuel pump splined couplings. Since the FAA issued AD 2013-05-13, the manufacturer has revised the time limits manual (TLM), introducing new and more restrictive instructions, including the replacement of the fuel pump splined coupling. This proposed AD would expand the applicability by adding a model turbofan engine to the applicability and would also require revisions to the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the operator's existing approved aircraft maintenance program (AMP), as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
