## Summary

The United States Census Bureau seeks comments on the Draft U.S. Census Bureau Plan for Providing Public Access to Results of Federally Funded Research. The Census Bureau is taking steps to make its scientific data and publications more readily available and accessible by the public, as directed in an August 2022 Memorandum from the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). The Census Bureau's Public Access Plan applies to the results of research funded wholly or in part by the Census Bureau, presented in peer-reviewed scholarly publications including book chapters and peer-reviewed conference proceedings as appropriate, and scientific data as defined in the OSTP Memo. The document outlines the Census Bureau's plan for implementing new requirements to manage the public access of scientific data and publications. Public comments received on the Public Access Plan will inform Census Bureau as it develops policies and procedures to implement the Plan.
