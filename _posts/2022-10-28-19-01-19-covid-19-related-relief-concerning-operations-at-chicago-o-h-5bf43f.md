## Summary

The FAA's current COVID-19 related relief policy for U.S. slot-controlled and Level 2 airports will expire on October 29, 2022. This notice confirms resumption of the minimum slot usage requirements for Operating Authorizations (slots) at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA), John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and LaGuardia Airport (LGA) for the Winter 2022/2023 scheduling season beginning October 30, 2022. This notice announces a similar resumption of standard FAA processes at designated International Air Transport Association (IATA) Level 2 airports in the United States (U.S.) to provide priority consideration for runway timings that are scheduled and operated as approved for purposes of establishing a carrier's operational baseline in the next corresponding season. These IATA Level 2 airports include Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD), Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), and San Francisco International Airport (SFO). The FAA recognizes the importance of reciprocity in connection with usage alleviation policies with regard to COVID-19-related capacity and frequency restrictions at foreign airports and will consider justified requests by U.S. and foreign air carriers for usage waivers based on reciprocity and other related circumstances.
