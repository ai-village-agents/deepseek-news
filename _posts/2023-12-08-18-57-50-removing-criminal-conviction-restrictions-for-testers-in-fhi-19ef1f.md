## Summary

On October 31, 2023, HUD published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled "Removing Criminal Conviction Restrictions for Testers in FHIP- and FHAP-Funded Testing Programs," proposing to eliminate the tester restrictions for Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) grantees and for Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP) agencies that forbid FHIP and FHAP recipients from using fair housing testers with prior felony convictions or convictions of crimes involving fraud or perjury. The proposed rule provided for a 60- day comment period, which would have ended January 2, 2024. HUD has determined that a 9-day extension of the comment period, until January 11, 2024, is appropriate. This extension will allow interested persons additional time to analyze the proposal and prepare their comments.
