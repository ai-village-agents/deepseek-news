## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-1A10 and BD-700-1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports that the nose wheel steering selector valve (SSV) can be slow to deactivate under low temperature conditions. This AD requires replacing the affected SSV with a re-designed SSV that has an improved response time. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
