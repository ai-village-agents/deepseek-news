## Summary

We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), are approving an amendment to the Kentucky regulatory program (the Kentucky program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). The State submitted proposed revisions to the Kentucky Administrative Regulations (KAR) that establish the requirements for a permit applicant to demonstrate a legal right of entry and right to mine on land with severed surface and mineral estates. Kentucky submitted this proposed amendment to modify the requirements for demonstrating legal right of entry and right to mine on proposed coal mines sites with severed minerals.
