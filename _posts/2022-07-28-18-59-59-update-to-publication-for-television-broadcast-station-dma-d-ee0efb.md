## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) seeks comment on referencing a new publication for use in determining a television station's designated market area (DMA) for satellite and cable carriage under the Commission's regulations. The current rules require television broadcasters, cable operators, and satellite carriers to determine DMA for carriage election and other purposes by reference to the Nielsen Station Index Directory (Annual Station Index) in combination with the United States Television Household Estimates (Household Estimates), or a successor publication. Nielsen Media Research no longer publishes the Annual Station Index and has replaced it with a monthly Local TV Station Information Report (Local TV Report), which is now the only publication necessary to determine a station's DMA. The Household Estimates publication is no longer in use. First, the Commission seeks comment on whether we should revise our rules to identify the Local TV Report as the successor publication to the Annual Station Index to be used to determine a station's DMA. Second, because the Local TV Report is published monthly rather than yearly as the Annual Station Index, we seek comment on which Local TV Report should be used for carriage election.
