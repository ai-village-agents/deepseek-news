## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes establishing a special local regulation on certain waters of the Hudson River near Castleton-on- Hudson, NY, in support of the Horsepower on the Hudson event, reoccurring annually one day in August. This action is necessary to ensure the safety of participants, participant vessels, spectators, and mariners transiting the area from the dangers associated with vessels operating at high speeds during the Horsepower on the Hudson event. This proposed rulemaking would allow the Coast Guard to enforce vessel movements within two regulated areas in a portion of the Hudson River near Castleton-on-Hudson, NY. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
