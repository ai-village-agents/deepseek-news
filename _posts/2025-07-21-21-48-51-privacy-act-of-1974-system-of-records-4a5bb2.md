## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to modify and reissue a DHS system of records titled, "DHS/U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)- 006 ICE Intelligence Records Systems (IIRS)." The IIRS system of records incorporates ICE systems that contain raw intelligence and intelligence products collected to support its law enforcement intelligence, counterterrorism, and homeland security mission. DHS/ICE is modifying this system of records notice (SORN) to: document the decommissioning of two technology systems and reflect the information collected and maintained by DHS/ICE program offices in accordance with their respective missions; update and clarify the categories of individuals; update the categories of records; and update routine uses. Additionally, this notice includes non-substantive changes to simplify the formatting and text of the previously published notice. This modified system will be included in DHS's inventory of record systems.
