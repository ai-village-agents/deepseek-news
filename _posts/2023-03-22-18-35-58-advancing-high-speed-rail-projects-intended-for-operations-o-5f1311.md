## Summary

The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is issuing this notice to encourage development of high-speed rail (HSR) system projects intended for operations over 160 miles per hour by establishing a streamlined process for reviewing domestic sourcing and workforce plans. Specifically, this notice summarizes FRA's intent to invite HSR project sponsors to voluntarily submit for review, in advance of receipt of DOT funding, their domestic sourcing and workforce plans. This notice provides further clarification to the December 7, 2022, Notice of Funding Opportunity for the Federal-State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail Program, which stated that FRA expects all applicants to comply with Buy America requirements without needing a waiver. However, to obtain a waiver, an applicant must be prepared to demonstrate how they will maximize the use of domestic goods, products, and materials in constructing their project. If an applicant anticipates it may need a waiver, the applicant should indicate the need in its application and submit materials necessary for such requests together with its application. This notice provides further detail on the recommended content of these materials. This notice also serves as an RFI to assist with planning a U.S. domestic content High Speed Rail Industry Exchange Day (Industry Day).
