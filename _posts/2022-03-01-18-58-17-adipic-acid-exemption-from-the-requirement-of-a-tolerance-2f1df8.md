## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of adipic acid (CAS Reg. No. 124-04-9) when used as an inert ingredient (acidification or buffering agent, pH regulator) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops. Verdesian Life Sciences U.S., LLC, and Fine Agrochemicals Ltd., submitted petitions to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) requesting the establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for adipic acid. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of adipic acid on food or feed commodities when used in accordance with this exemption.
