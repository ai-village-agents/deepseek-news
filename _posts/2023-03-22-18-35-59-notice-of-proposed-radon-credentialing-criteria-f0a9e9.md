## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) seeks input on criteria to help align and ensure consistency across radon service provider credentialing programs operated by certification bodies and states. The criteria reflect stakeholder feedback received in response to a 2017 Federal Register Notice on the same subject and consideration of conformity assessment practices in place across the federal government. The EPA is soliciting comment on these criteria. The comments will inform development of the final version of the criteria.
