## Summary

The FAA is revising a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that applied to certain Learjet, Inc., Model 45 airplanes. This action revises the NPRM by adding airplanes to the applicability. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive (AD) to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over that in the NPRM, the FAA is requesting comments on this SNPRM.
