## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Embraer S.A. Model ERJ 190-300 and -400 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that the method for calculating level-off altitude by the computerized airplane flight manual (CAFM), may result in a non- conservative level-off height. This AD requires revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to incorporate new CAFM versions as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
