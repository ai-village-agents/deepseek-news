## Summary

The Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation (OPRE) within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is proposing a new information collection for the Child Welfare Study to Enhance Equity with Data (CW-SEED). The project aims to understand how and to what extent data are used to explore equity in service delivery and child and family outcomes, to identify barriers or problematic data practices, and to explore efforts by child welfare agencies and their partners to use data to reduce barriers across the continuum of child welfare services.
