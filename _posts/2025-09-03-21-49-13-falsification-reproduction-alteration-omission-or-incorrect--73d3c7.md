## Summary

FAA is amending, restructuring, and consolidating the falsification regulations presently located throughout title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Regarding 14 CFR chapter I, this rule eliminates inconsistencies among the various falsification regulations and associated sanctions; consolidates all existing falsification regulations into one part under 14 CFR chapter I to standardize the existing falsification regulations; and ensures that falsification-related conduct not addressed by pertinent current regulations is covered. This rule also creates a falsification prohibition applicable to the regulations governing commercial space transportation.
