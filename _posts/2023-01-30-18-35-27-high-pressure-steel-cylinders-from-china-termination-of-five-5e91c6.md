## Summary

The Commission instituted the subject five-year reviews on November 1, 2022 to determine whether revocation of the countervailing duty order and antidumping duty order on high pressure steel cylinders from China would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury. On January 20, 2023, the Department of Commerce published notice that it was revoking the orders effective December 5, 2022, because no domestic interested party responded to the sunset review notice of initiation by the applicable deadline. Accordingly, the subject reviews are terminated.
