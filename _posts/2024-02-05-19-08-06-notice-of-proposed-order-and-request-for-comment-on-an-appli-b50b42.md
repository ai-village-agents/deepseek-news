## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is soliciting public comment on an application submitted by the Institute of International Bankers, International Swaps and Derivatives Association, and Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association requesting that the Commission determine that the capital and financial reporting laws and regulations of the United Kingdom applicable to CFTC-registered swap dealers organized and domiciled in the United Kingdom, which are licensed under the United Kingdom Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 as investment firms and designated for prudential supervision by the United Kingdom Prudential Regulation Authority, provide sufficient bases for an affirmative finding of comparability with respect to the Commission's swap dealer capital and financial reporting requirements adopted under the Commodity Exchange Act. The Commission is also soliciting public comment on a proposed order providing for the conditional availability of substituted compliance in connection with the application.
