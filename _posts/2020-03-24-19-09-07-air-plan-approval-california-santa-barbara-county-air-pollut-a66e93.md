## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve revisions to the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District's (SBAPCD or "the District") portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern the District's New Source Review (NSR) permitting program for new and modified sources of air pollution under section 110(a)(2)(C) of the Clean Air Act (CAA). This action updates the SBAPCD's applicable SIP with current permitting rules.
