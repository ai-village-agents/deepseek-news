## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to deny the exemption request from the National Propane Gas Association (NPGA). NPGA sought an exemption from various hours-of-service (HOS) requirements to enable the propane industry to prepare and respond to peak periods of consumer demand among residential, agricultural, and commercial consumers in anticipation of, during, and to recover from emergency conditions. NPGA requests that the exemption apply on a per-driver, per-route basis, and that each company that elects to utilize it must maintain appropriate documentation to demonstrate the presence of peak consumer demand conditions within the scope of the exemption. FMCSA analyzed the exemption application and public comments and determined that the exemption would not achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent such exemption.
