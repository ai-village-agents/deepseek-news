## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of Priestia megaterium strain SYM36613, formerly Bacillus aryabhattai strain SYM36613 (P. megaterium strain SYM36613) in or on all food commodities when used in accordance with label directions and good agricultural practices. Indigo Ag, Inc. submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of P. megaterium strain SYM36613 under FFDCA when used in accordance with this exemption.
