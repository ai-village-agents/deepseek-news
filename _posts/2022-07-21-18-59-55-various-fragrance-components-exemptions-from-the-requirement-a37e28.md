## Summary

This regulation establishes exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of various fragrance components listed in unit II of this document when they are used as inert ingredients in antimicrobial pesticide formulations for use on food contact surfaces in public eating places, dairy processing equipment, and food processing equipment and utensils with end-use concentration not to exceed 100 parts per million (ppm). Verto Solutions on behalf of The Clorox Company submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting the establishment of such exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of various fragrance components.
