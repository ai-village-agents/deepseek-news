## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-08- 08, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. AD 2021-08-08 required replacing affected bleed duct assemblies and bleed gimbals at the wing-to-pylon interface, and prohibited the installation of affected parts. This AD was prompted by a report of a welding quality issue in the gimbal joint of the air bleed duct at each wing-to-pylon interface and the consequent deformation of the gimbal inner ring, and by new findings that affected bleed gimbals were found on certain airplanes that did not have any maintenance record of affected part replacement. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2021-08-08 and, for certain airplanes, requires inspection of the bleed gimbals to determine the part number, and replacement if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
