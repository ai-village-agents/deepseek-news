## Summary

This notice serves to inform interested parties and the public of the Maritime Administration's (MARAD) new program designating eligible and qualified training entities as Centers of Excellence for Domestic Maritime Workforce Training and Education (CoE). The National Defense Authorization Act of 2018 (the Act), provided the Secretary of Transportation with the discretionary authority to designate eligible and qualified entities as CoEs. CoE designations will serve to assist the maritime industry in obtaining and maintaining the highest quality workforce. On July 19, 2019, the agency published a notice in the Federal Register seeking public comments on a draft policy under which designations would be carried out. Below, MARAD provides its responses to all comments received. The agency is now announcing its voluntary program to identify and recommend qualified training providers for CoE designation.
