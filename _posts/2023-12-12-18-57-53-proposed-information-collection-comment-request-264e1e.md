## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) offers the public and Federal agencies the opportunity to comment regarding the NTSB's intent to submit an Information Collection Request (ICR) seeking reinstatement, with change, of a previously-approved information collection (IC) for which approval for Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Control No. 3147-0001 has expired. The NTSB's 60-Day Notice, soliciting comments on the IC was published on May 4, 2021, and the NTSB has since revised the form in response to comments received as a result. The NTSB is issuing this 30-Day Notice, informing the public and Federal agencies to submit comments directly to the Office of Information & Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) regarding this ICR.
