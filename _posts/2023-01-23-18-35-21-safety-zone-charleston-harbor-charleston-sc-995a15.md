The safety zone is needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards created by the dead ship movement of USNS Gordon from the Naval Weapons Station, Joint Base Charleston Transportation Core (TC) Dock or Wharf Alpha through the Charleston Harbor Entrance Channel. Entry of vessels or persons into this zone is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port Sector Charleston.
