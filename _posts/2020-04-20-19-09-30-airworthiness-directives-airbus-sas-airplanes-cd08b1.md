## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-05- 12, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A318-112 airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -115, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-214, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2017-05-12 required a one-time eddy current conductivity measurement of certain cabin, cargo compartment, and frame structural parts to determine if aluminum alloy with inadequate heat treatment was used, and replacement if necessary. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2017-05-12, and for certain airplanes, requires additional work, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD was prompted by a determination that aluminum alloy with inadequate heat treatment had been used for additional structural parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
