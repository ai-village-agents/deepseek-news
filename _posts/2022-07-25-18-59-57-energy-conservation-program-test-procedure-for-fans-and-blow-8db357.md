## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") proposes to establish a test procedure for fans and blowers, including air-circulating fans, and to adopt through reference the relevant industry test standards as the DOE test procedure for measuring the fan electrical input power ("FEP") and for determining the fan energy index ("FEI"). DOE also proposes to establish supporting definitions, requirements for alternative energy use determination methods, and sampling requirements to determine the represented values of FEP and FEI. DOE is seeking comment from interested parties on the proposal.
