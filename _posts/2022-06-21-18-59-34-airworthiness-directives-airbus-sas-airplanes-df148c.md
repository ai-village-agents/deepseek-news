## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-26-11, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A319-112, -115, and -132; A320-214, -216, -232, -233, -251N, and -271N; and A321-211, - 231, -232, -251N, and -253N airplanes; and AD 2021-23-15, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, - 132, and -133; A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233; and A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2019-26-11 requires replacing the affected bumpers with serviceable bumpers. AD 2021-23-15 requires modifying the waste compartment door of each affected galley. Since the FAA issued AD 2019-26-11 and AD 2021- 23-15, it was determined that additional airplanes are subject to the unsafe conditions described in those ADs. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2019-26-11 and AD 2021-23-15, and would add airplanes to the applicability, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
