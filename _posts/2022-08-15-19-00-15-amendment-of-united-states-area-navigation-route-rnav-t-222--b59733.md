## Summary

This action corrects a final rule published by the FAA in the Federal Register on June 30, 2022, that amends United States Area Navigation (RNAV) route T-222 in the vicinity of Bethel, AK, in support of a large and comprehensive T-route modernization project for the state of Alaska. The final rule identified the CABOT, AK, and IKUFU, AK, route points as waypoints (WPs), in error. This action makes editorial corrections to all references of the CABOT, AK, and IKUFU, AK, WPs to change them to be reflected as Fixes and match the FAA's aeronautical database information.
