## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Safran Helicopter Engines, S.A. (Safran) (type certificate previously held by Turbomeca S.A.) Model Arrius 2R engines. This AD is prompted by reports of inconsistencies between the torque (TQ) and measured gas temperature (MGT) conformation values recorded in the avionics and the TQ and MGT conformation values recorded on the engine log cards following replacement of the M01 and M02 modules installed on the engine. This AD requires a one-time check of the consistency between the TQ and MGT conformation values recorded in the avionics and the values recorded on the engine log cards, and, if necessary, recalibrating the values and updating the engine logs, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
