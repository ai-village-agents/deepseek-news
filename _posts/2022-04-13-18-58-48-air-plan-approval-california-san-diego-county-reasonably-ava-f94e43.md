## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the San Diego Air Pollution Control District (SDAPCD or "District") portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern SDAPCD's negative declarations for certain Control Techniques Guidelines (CTGs) as they apply to the 2008 and 2015 ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or "standards") reasonably available control technology (RACT) SIP. We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
