## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-20-10 for certain Leonardo S.p.a. Model AB139 and AW139 helicopters. AD 2021- 20-10 required removing from service a certain part-numbered main gearbox (MGB) spherical bearing lock nut (lock nut) that is installed on certain part-numbered MGBs and replacing it with a newly designed MGB lock nut. AD 2021-20-10 also prohibited installing any MGB with the affected MGB lock nut and prohibited installing any affected MGB lock nut on any helicopter. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-20-10, it was discovered that a part number (P/N) was incorrectly listed and that the applicability needed to be clarified. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2021-20-10 and clarifies the applicability. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
