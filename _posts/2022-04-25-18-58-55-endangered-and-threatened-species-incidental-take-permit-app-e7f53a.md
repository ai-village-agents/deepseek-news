## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), have received an application from 8minute Solar Energy for an incidental take permit under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. The permit would authorize take of the federally threatened desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) incidental to otherwise lawful activities associated with construction, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning of the Bellefield Solar Energy Project. We invite comments on the draft habitat conservation plan and the draft environmental assessment, which we have prepared pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. We will take comments into consideration before deciding whether to issue an incidental take permit.
