## Summary

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) proposes to extend data collection under the existing overarching generic clearance for Formative Data Collections for ACF Research and Evaluation (OMB #0970-0356). There are no changes to the proposed types of information collection or uses of data, but the request does include an increase to the estimated number of respondents and, therefore, the overall burden estimate.
