## Summary

On December 14, 2021, the Department of Commerce (Commerce) published the Federal Register notice of the final determination in the anti-circumvention inquiries of the antidumping duty (AD) orders on certain uncoated paper from Brazil, the People's Republic of China (China), and Indonesia and the countervailing duty (CVD) orders on certain uncoated paper from China and Indonesia. This notice inadvertently did not address Commerce's intent to instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to liquidate certain uncoated paper entries from China.
