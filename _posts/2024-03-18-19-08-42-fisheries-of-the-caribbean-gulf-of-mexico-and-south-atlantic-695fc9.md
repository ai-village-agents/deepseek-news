## Summary

NMFS announces the 2024 recreational fishing season for blueline tilefish in South Atlantic Federal waters. Announcing the length of the recreational season is part of the accountability measures (AMs) for the recreational sector. The recreational season opens on May 1, 2024, and NMFS has projected that recreational landings of blueline tilefish will reach the recreational annual catch limit (ACL) after July 18, 2024. Therefore, NMFS closes the recreational sector for blueline tilefish on July 19, 2024. The recreational season length and closure are necessary to protect the blueline tilefish resource in South Atlantic Federal waters.
