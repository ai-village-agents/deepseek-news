## Summary

The FAA is updating certain procedural regulations relating to civil aircraft registration and recordation to provide administrative relief from the requirements for submitting original documents and to sunset the FAA's practice of stamping documents. Amending these regulations will reduce administrative burdens and enable the FAA to better utilize the capabilities of the Civil Aviation Registry Electronic Services (CARES) system for civil aircraft registration and recordation.
