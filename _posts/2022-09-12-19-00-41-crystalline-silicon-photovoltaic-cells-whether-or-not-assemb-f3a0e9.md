# Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells, Whether or Not Assembled Into Modules, From the People's Republic of China: Final Results and Partial Rescission of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review; 2019 and Notice of Amended Final Results of Countervailing Duty Review, 2019; Corrections

## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) published a notice in the Federal Register on July 7, 2022, in which Commerce announced the final results, and partial rescission, of the 2019 administrative review of the countervailing duty (CVD) order on crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells, whether or not assembled into modules, (solar cells) from the People's Republic of China (China). This notice inadvertently included two companies in Appendix III, which is a list of companies for which Commerce rescinded the review, instead of listing them in Appendix II, which is a list of "Non-Selected Companies Under Review." We also incorrectly titled Appendix III "Intent to Rescind Review, In Part," instead of "Rescission of Review, In Part." Further, Commerce also published a notice in the Federal Register of August 15, 2022, in which Commerce amended the final results of the administrative review. In this notice, Commerce also inadvertently did not list the same two companies as "Non- Selected Companies Under Review" in the appendix. We are correcting these inadvertent errors with this notice, as described below.
