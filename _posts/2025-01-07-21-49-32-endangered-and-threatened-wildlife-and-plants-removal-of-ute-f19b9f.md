## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to remove Ute ladies'-tresses (Spiranthes diluvialis) from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Plants. This determination also serves as our 12-month finding on a petition to delist Ute ladies'- tresses. After a review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that delisting the species is warranted. Our review indicates that the threats to Ute ladies'-tresses have been eliminated or reduced to the point that the species no longer meets the definition of an endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Accordingly, we propose to delist Ute ladies'-tresses. If we finalize this rule as proposed, the prohibitions and conservation measures provided by the Act, particularly through sections 7 and 9, would no longer apply to Ute ladies'-tresses. We request information and comments from the public regarding this proposed rule and the draft post-delisting monitoring (PDM) plan for Ute ladies'-tresses.
