## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce findings that three salamander species, the Samwel salamander (Hydromantes samweli), Shasta salamander, (H. shastae), and Wintu salamander (H. wintu), are not warranted for listing as endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). However, we ask the public to submit to us at any time any new information relevant to the status of any of the three species or their habitats.
