## Summary

The FAA announces the release of the Draft Environmental Assessment (EA) for proposed departure procedure amendments at Bob Hope "Hollywood Burbank" Airport (BUR Airport). The FAA has prepared the Draft EA to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the FAA adopting new procedures for Runway 15 departures at BUR Airport. If implemented, the Proposed Action (Alternative A) is intended to maintain the safety and efficiency of the National Airspace System (NAS) while meeting the terms of a settlement agreement that the FAA entered with local homeowners' associations, which requires consideration of alternative procedures. The FAA also evaluated proposed amendments put forth by the Southern San Fernando Valley Airplane Noise Task Force for BUR Airport (Alternative B).
