## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC, the Commission) received and is considering approval of an application filed by Susquehanna Nuclear, LLC (Susquehanna Nuclear) on September 29, 2022, as supplemented by letter dated October 28, 2022. The application seeks NRC approval of the indirect transfer of Renewed Facility Operating License Nos. NPF-14 and NPF-22 for Susquehanna Steam Electric Station (Susquehanna), Units 1 and 2, respectively, and the general license for the Susquehanna independent spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI) as a result of the restructuring of Talen Energy Corporation, an indirect parent of Susquehanna Nuclear, as a reorganized company yet to be named (referred to as "Reorganized Talen"). The NRC is also considering amending the renewed facility operating licenses for administrative purposes to reflect the proposed transfer. The application and supplement contain sensitive unclassified non-safeguards information (SUNSI).
