## Summary

The Department of Energy, Office of Legacy Management (DOE-LM) has filed an application with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) requesting that the Secretary of the Interior exercise authority under Title II of the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 (UMTRCA) and permanently withdraw and transfer administrative jurisdiction to DOE-LM of 869.08 acres of public lands and 3,454.39 acres of Federal mineral estate at the Split Rock Site in Wyoming. The public land and interests in the land would be withdrawn from operation of the general land laws, including the United States mining laws, the mineral and geothermal leasing laws, and the mineral materials disposal laws, subject to valid existing rights, and would be transferred to DOE-LM for long term maintenance and monitoring under a Nuclear Regulatory Commission license as part of the Split Rock Disposal Cell Site. The BLM previously published notice of a DOE-LM application for withdrawal and transfer of jurisdiction for some of these lands and minerals for the same purpose in the Federal Register on April 14, 2008 (73 FR 20062-63). This notice announces a 30-day opportunity for the public to comment on the DOE-LM application.
