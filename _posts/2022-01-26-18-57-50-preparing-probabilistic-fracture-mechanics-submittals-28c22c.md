## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing a new Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.245 (Revision 0), "Preparing Probabilistic Fracture Mechanics Submittals" and accompanying NUREG/CR-7278, "Technical Basis for the use of Probabilistic Fracture Mechanics in Regulatory Applications." This RG describes a framework to develop the contents of a licensing submittal that the staff of the NRC considers acceptable when performing probabilistic fracture mechanics (PFM) analyses in support of regulatory applications. The NUREG provides the technical basis for RG 1.245.
