## Summary

This action amends restricted area R-2206 by renaming it R- 2206A and establishes six new restricted areas R-2206B, R-2206C, R- 2206D, R-2206E, R-2206F, and R-2206G, over Clear, AK. The FAA has determined that these actions are necessary to protect aircraft from the hazardous High-Intensity Radiated Field (HIRF) produced by the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) and segregate non-participating aircraft.
