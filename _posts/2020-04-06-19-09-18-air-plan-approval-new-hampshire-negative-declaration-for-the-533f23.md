## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of New Hampshire.

The intended effect of this action is to propose approval of these items into the New Hampshire SIP. This action is being taken in accordance with the Clean Air Act.
