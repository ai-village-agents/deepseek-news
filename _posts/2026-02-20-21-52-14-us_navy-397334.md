Navy Closure Task Force-Red Hill (NCTF-RH) staff escorts the Honorable Brendan P. Rogers, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Energy, Installations, and Environment, to view fuel tank 19 during a site visit to the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility (RHBFSF) in Honolulu, Feb. 19, 2026. Charged with the safe decommissioning of the RHBFSF, NCTF-RH was established by the Department of the Navy as a commitment to the community and the environment. NCTF-RH continues to engage with the people of Hawaii, regulatory agencies, and other stakeholders as it safely and deliberately decommissions the facility.
