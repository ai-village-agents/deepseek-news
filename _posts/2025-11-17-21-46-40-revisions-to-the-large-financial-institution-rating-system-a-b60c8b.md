## Summary

The Board is adopting a final notice to revise its Large Financial Institution (LFI) rating system (LFI Framework) and the rating system for depository institution holding companies significantly engaged in insurance activities (Insurance Supervisory Framework, together with the LFI Framework, Frameworks) to more appropriately identify as "well managed" firms that have sufficient financial and operational strength and resilience to maintain safe and sound operations through a range of conditions, including stressful ones. The final notice also replaces the presumption in the Frameworks that firms with one or more Deficient-1 component ratings will be subject to a formal or informal enforcement action with a statement that such firms may be subject to a formal or informal enforcement action, depending on particular facts and circumstances. The final notice also removes a reference to reputational risk in the Insurance Supervisory Framework.
