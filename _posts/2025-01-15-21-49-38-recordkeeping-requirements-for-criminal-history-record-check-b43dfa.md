## Summary

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is issuing technical amendments to certain aviation security regulations. The technical amendments to the regulations clarify that airport operators and aircraft operators are required to retain only the criminal records, including the application for a criminal history records check (CHRC), associated with an individual's current CHRC, CHRC certification, or authorization to perform a covered function and not records associated with previous CHRCs or employment investigations. Also, the technical amendments clarify that the records may be stored in paper or electronic form.
