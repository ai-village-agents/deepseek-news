## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to establish a new DHS system of records titled, "Department of Homeland Security/ALL-043 Enterprise Biometric Administrative Records (EBAR) System of Records (SOR)." This system of records allows the DHS to collect and maintain administrative and technical records associated with the enterprise biometric system known as the Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT) and its successor information technology system, currently in development, called the Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology (HART). Additionally, DHS is issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to exempt this system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act, elsewhere in the Federal Register. This newly established system will be included in the Department of Homeland Security's inventory of record systems.
