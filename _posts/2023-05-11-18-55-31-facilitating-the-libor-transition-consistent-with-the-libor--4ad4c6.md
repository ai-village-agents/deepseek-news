## Summary

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB or Bureau) is issuing an interim final rule amending Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), to reflect the enactment of the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the LIBOR Act or Act) and its implementing regulation promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board). This interim final rule further addresses the planned cessation of most U.S. Dollar (USD) LIBOR tenors after June 30, 2023, by incorporating the Board-selected benchmark replacement for consumer loans into Regulation Z. This interim final rule conforms the terminology from the LIBOR Act and the Board's implementing regulation into relevant Regulation Z open-end and closed- end credit provisions and also addresses treatment of the 12-month USD LIBOR index and its replacement index, including permitting creditors to use alternative language in change-in-terms notice content requirements for situations where the 12-month tenor of the LIBOR index is being replaced consistent with the LIBOR Act. The CFPB requests public comment on this interim final rule.
