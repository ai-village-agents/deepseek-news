## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-18- 05, which applied to certain ATR-GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42-200, -300, and -320 airplanes; and AD 2020- 09-16, which applied to all ATR-GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42-200, -300, and -320 airplanes. AD 2018-18-05 and AD 2020- 09-16 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. This AD is prompted by a determination that additional new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2020-09-16. This AD also requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate additional new or more restrictive maintenance requirements and airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
