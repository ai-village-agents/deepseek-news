## Summary

We, NMFS, have determined that a designation of critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) for the oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) is not prudent at this time. Based on a comprehensive review of the best scientific data available, we find there are no identifiable physical or biological features that are essential to the conservation of the oceanic whitetip shark within areas under U.S. jurisdiction. We also find that there are no areas outside of the geographical area occupied by the species under U.S. jurisdiction that are essential to its conservation. As such, we find there are no areas within the jurisdiction of the United States that meet the definition of critical habitat for the oceanic whitetip shark.
