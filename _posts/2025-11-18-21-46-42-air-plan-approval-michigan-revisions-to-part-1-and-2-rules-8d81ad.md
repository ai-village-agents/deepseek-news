## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving revisions to the Michigan State Implementation Plan (SIP) that Michigan's Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) submitted on March 8, 2022. These revisions amend Michigan's SIP- approved rules for minor New Source Review (NSR) found in Michigan Air Pollution Control Rules Part 2, Air Use Approval. This action updates Michigan's minor NSR rules in the SIP to exempt certain processes and equipment from the requirement to obtain a preconstruction permit.
