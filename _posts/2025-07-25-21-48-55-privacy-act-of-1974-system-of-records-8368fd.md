## Summary

The purpose of this notice is to meet the requirement of M-17- 12 requiring agencies to include two mandatory routine uses in all agency System of Records Notices (SORN) to facilitate information sharing in responding to breaches. The amended list of routine uses is consistent with requirements in a memorandum issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on January 3, 2017. The memorandum requires that all Federal agencies publish two routine uses for their systems allowing for the disclosure of personally identifiable information to the appropriate parties in the course of responding to a breach or suspected breach of the agency's PII or to assist another agency in its response to a confirmed or suspected breach.
