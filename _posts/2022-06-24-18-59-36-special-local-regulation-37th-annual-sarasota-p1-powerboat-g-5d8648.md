## Summary

The Coast Guard will enforce a special local regulation on the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, in the vicinity of Lido Beach, Florida, during the Sarasota Powerboat Grand Prix. Approximately 55 boats and jet skis, traveling at speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour are expected to participate. Additionally, it is anticipated that 300 spectator vessels will be present along the race course. The special local regulation is necessary to protect the safety of race participants, participant vessels, spectators, and the general public on certain navigable waters of the Gulf of Mexico, Lido Beach, Florida during the event. The special local regulation will establish an enforcement area where all persons and vessels, except those persons and vessels participating in the high speed boat races, are prohibited from entering, transiting through, anchoring in, or remaining within the regulated area without obtaining permission from the Captain of the Port St. Petersburg or a designated representative.
