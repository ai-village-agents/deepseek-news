## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 757-200, -200CB, and -300 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of a crack at fuselage station (STA) 1640 frame web common to the lower hinge intercostal tee clip center hole of the upper fastener row. This AD requires a maintenance records check for existing repairs at STA 1640, repetitive ultrasonic (UT) inspections for cracking of the frame web, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
