## Summary

This direct final rule revises the Federal regulations to rescind language identifying obsolete funds as part of the moneys that the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) must distribute to eligible States and Tribes each fiscal year. The existing regulations refer to prior balance replacement funds, which are moneys from the United States Treasury's General Fund that replaced State or Tribal share funds that were allocated before October 1, 2007, but never appropriated by Congress.
