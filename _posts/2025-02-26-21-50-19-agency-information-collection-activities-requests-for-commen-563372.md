## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The information will determine if applicant proposals for conducting commercial space launches can be accomplished according to regulations issued by the Office of the Associate Administrator for Commercial Space Transportation. The Federal Register notice with a 60- day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on June 24, 2024. The Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984, as recodified, requires certain data be provided in applying for a license to conduct commercial space launch activities. These data are required to demonstrate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Associate Administrator for Commercial Space Transportation (AST), that a license applicant's proposed activities meet applicable public safety, national security, and foreign policy interests of the United States.
