## Summary

On September 8, 2023, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requested comments on the regulatory basis to support a rulemaking to amend the NRC's regulations related to the use of conventional and accident tolerant light-water reactor fuel designs. The public comment period was originally scheduled to close on November 22, 2023. The NRC has decided to extend the public comment period to allow more time for members of the public to develop and submit their comments.
