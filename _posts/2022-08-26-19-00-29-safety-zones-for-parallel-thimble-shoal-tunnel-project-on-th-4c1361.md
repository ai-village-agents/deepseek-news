## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing temporary safety zones for certain waters of the Chesapeake Bay. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters near the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel (CBBT), linking Southeastern Virginia to the Eastern Shore, during an already ongoing construction project on the CBBT. This regulation prohibits persons and vessels from operating within 500 feet of the construction area unless authorized by the Captain of the Port (COTP) Sector Virginia or a designated representative.
