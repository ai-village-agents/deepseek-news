## Summary

This order extends the duration of the withdrawal created by Public Land Order (PLO) No. 7533 for an additional 20-year period. PLO No. 7533 withdrew 1,265 acres of National Forest System lands in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest from location and entry under the United States mining laws for a period of 20 years to protect the Holden Mine Reclamation Project. Under that project, the United States Forest Service is remediating the release of hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, including undertaking infrastructure improvements and capital investments. A Federal Register notice published on October 27, 2021, corrected the legal land description and acreage figure (from 1,265 acres to 1,285 acres) stated in PLO No. 7533. The withdrawal extension is necessary to continue protecting the Holden Mine Reclamation Project in Chelan County, Washington. Without the extension, the protection afforded by the withdrawal expires on August 5, 2022.
