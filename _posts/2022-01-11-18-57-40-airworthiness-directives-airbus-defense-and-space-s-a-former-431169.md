## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-25- 16, which applied to certain Airbus Defense and Space S.A. Model CN- 235, CN-235-200, and CN-235-300 airplanes. AD 2018-25-16 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2018-25-16, the FAA has determined that additional new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, including inspections for discrepancies (cracking) of certain structural elements, are necessary. This AD requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate additional new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, and repetitive inspections for discrepancies (cracking) of certain structural elements and corrective actions; as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
