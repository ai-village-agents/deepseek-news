## Summary

The Department of Defense (DoD) proposes to amend the regulations governing medical malpractice claims by members of the uniformed services to adjust and update certain portions of the regulation related to calculation of damages. Currently, total potential damages are reduced by offsetting most of the compensation otherwise provided or expected to be provided by DoD or the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for the same harm that is the subject of the medical malpractice claim. The amendments would apply offsets to economic damages only. The amendments would also clarify when future lost wages may be awarded.
