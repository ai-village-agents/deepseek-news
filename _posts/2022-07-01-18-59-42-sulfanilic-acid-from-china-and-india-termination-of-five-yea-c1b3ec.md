## Summary

The Commission instituted the subject five-year reviews on April 1, 2022 (87 FR 19131) to determine whether revocation of the antidumping duty orders on sulfanilic acid from China and India, and the countervailing duty order on imports of sulfanilic acid from India would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury. On June 14, 2022, the Department of Commerce published notice (87 FR 35968) that it was revoking the orders effective May 9, 2022, because no domestic interested party filed a timely notice of intent to participate. Accordingly, the subject reviews are terminated.
