## Summary

The Regional Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency Region 6 (EPA) is providing notice of the availability of EPA's final determination that storm water discharges from the Los Alamos Urban Cluster (as defined by the 2010 Decennial Census) and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) property are contributing to violations of New Mexico water quality standards (WQS) and require National Pollutant Elimination System (NPDES) permit coverage under the Clean Water Act (CWA). This action is in response to a June 30, 2014 petition filed with EPA by Amigos Bravos entitled "A Petition by Amigos Bravos for a Determination that Storm Water Discharges in Los Alamos County Contribute to Water Quality Standards Violations and Require a Clean Water Act Permit."
