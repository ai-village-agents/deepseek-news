## Summary

The Department of Justice's Executive Office for Immigration Review ("EOIR") imposes fees, also known as user charges, for the filing of certain EOIR forms for applications for relief, appeals filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals ("BIA"), and motions to reopen or reconsider. When applicable, the current fee for EOIR applications for relief is $100, and the fee for motions or appeals is $110. EOIR last reviewed and updated these fees 33 years ago, in 1986. This proposed rule ("proposed rule" or "rule") would increase the fees for those EOIR applications, appeals, and motions that are subject to an EOIR-determined fee, based on a fee review conducted by EOIR. This proposed rule would not affect the fees that have been established by the Department of Homeland Security ("DHS") with respect to DHS forms for applications that are filed or submitted in EOIR proceedings. This proposal does not affect the ability of aliens to submit fee waiver requests, nor does it add new fees. The proposed rule also updates cross-references to DHS regulations regarding fees and makes a technical change regarding requests under the Freedom of Information Act.
