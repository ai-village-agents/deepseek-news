## Summary

The Federal Trade Commission ("Commission") published a document in the Federal Register of August 27, 2025, amending its Telemarketing Sales Rule ("TSR") by updating the fees charged to entities accessing the National Do Not Call Registry ("Registry") as required by the Do-Not-Call Registry Fee Extension Act of 2007. Shortly after publication, Commission staff learned the document contained an incorrect date. The Commission issues this correction to reflect the corrected date. The revised fees will become effective October 1, 2025, not October 1, 2024.
