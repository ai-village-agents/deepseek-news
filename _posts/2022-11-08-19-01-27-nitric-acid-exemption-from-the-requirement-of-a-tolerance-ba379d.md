## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of nitric acid (CAS Reg. No. 7697-37-2) when used as an inert ingredient (pH adjuster) applied to crops and raw agricultural commodities pre- and post-harvest, limited to no more than 10% by weight in the pesticide formulation. Technology Sciences Group, Inc. on behalf of Organisan Corporation, submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of nitric acid when used in accordance with the terms of the exemption.
