## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is disapproving elements of two State Implementation Plan (SIP) submissions from the State of Texas for the 2012 PM<INF>2.5</INF> National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) and the 2015 Ozone NAAQS. These submittals address how the existing SIP provides for implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of the 2012 PM<INF>2.5</INF> and 2015 Ozone NAAQS (infrastructure SIP or i-SIP). The i-SIP requirements are to ensure that the Texas SIP is adequate to meet the state's responsibilities under the CAA for these NAAQS. Specifically, this disapproval addresses the interstate visibility transport requirements of the i-SIP for the 2012 PM<INF>2.5</INF> and 2015 Ozone NAAQS under CAA section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(II). In addition to this disapproval, we are finalizing our determination that the requirements of those i-SIP elements are met through the Federal Implementation Plans (FIPs) in place for the Texas Regional Haze program, and no further federal action is required.
