## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to revise the Consumer Confidence Report (CCR) Rule in accordance with America's Water Infrastructure Act (AWIA) of 2018 (AWIA, 2018) and to require reporting of compliance monitoring data to EPA. The proposed revisions to improve the CCR would improve the readability, clarity, and understandability of CCRs as well as the accuracy of the information presented, improve risk communication in CCRs, incorporate electronic delivery options, provide supplemental information regarding lead levels and control efforts, and require systems who serve 10,000 or more persons to provide CCRs to customers biannually (twice per year). The proposed requirements for states to submit to EPA compliance monitoring data for all National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWRs) submitted by systems to the State would enhance EPA's oversight capabilities.
