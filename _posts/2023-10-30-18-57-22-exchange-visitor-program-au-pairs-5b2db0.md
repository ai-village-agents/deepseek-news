## Summary

The U.S. Department of State ("Department of State") proposes to amend existing Exchange Visitor Program regulations governing the Au pair category to clarify and modernize the au pair program, by, among other things, restructuring the child care and educational components, replacing the EduCare program with the part- time option, enhancing au pair and host family orientation requirements, formalizing standard operating procedures for rematching au pairs with new host families, and proposing new requirements to strengthen au pair protections. The Department of State encourages public comment on the proposed rule, particularly the restructuring of the au pair program and the calculation of the weekly compensation.
