## Summary

The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) is proposing to amend regulations that govern the provision of charter service by recipients of Federal financial assistance. The proposed changes will remove the Federal Financial Assistance Programs listed in an appendix and the guidance in additional appendices and make non-substantive technical edits throughout to remove outdated citations and provide clarity.
