## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing an approval and a limited approval and limited disapproval of a State Implementation Plan (SIP) submission made by the State of Arizona to address emissions of particulate matter 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller (PM<INF>10</INF>) from agricultural operations. The SIP submission includes an amended statute, two definition rules, and two rules regulating crop and animal operations in Pinal County, Arizona. We are proposing action on local rules to regulate these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act"). We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
