## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission or Agency) is establishing a new system of records, FCC/WCB-3, Emergency Broadband Benefit Program, subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. This action is necessary to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act to publish in the Federal Register notice of the existence and character of records maintained by the agency. The Emergency Broadband Benefit Program (or "Emergency Broadband") provides discounts for broadband internet access service (BIAS) to qualifying households. A household may qualify for Emergency Broadband if an individual in the household qualifies for the free and reduced lunch program, receives a Pell Grant, was recently laid off or furloughed, qualifies for the Lifeline program, or qualifies for a low-income or COVID-19 discount program offered by internet service providers. The Emergency Broadband program will be administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) under the direction of the Commission and, by delegation, of the Commission's Wireline Competition Bureau (WCB). This system of records contains information about individual Emergency Broadband participants and providers' enrollment representatives.
