## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes to amend its medical regulations that govern copayments for VA outpatient medical care and medications (to include outpatient medical care and medications provided by VA directly or community care obtained by VA through contracts, provider agreements or sharing agreements) by effectively eliminating the copayment for outpatient care and reducing the copayment for medications dispensed to veterans identified by VA as being at high risk for suicide. These copayment changes would be applied until VA determines that the veteran is no longer at high risk for suicide.
