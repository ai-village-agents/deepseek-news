## Summary

The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC), seeks approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for use of a modified survey that differs only slightly from the most recently approved information collection, OSC's 2020 Annual Survey. By statute, OSC must conduct an annual survey to collect feedback from those who have contacted OSC for assistance, either by filing complaints and/or disclosures with OSC, or by seeking Hatch Act Advisory Opinions. This OSC annual survey consists of four electronic questionnaires (one for each type of assistance an individual can seek from OSC), each asking between five and ten questions. OSC invites comments on: (a) The accuracy of OSC's estimate of the burden of the proposed collections of information; (b) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (c) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on respondents.
