## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes to amend its regulations to implement VA's authority to reconsider a prior decision to inter or honor the memory of a person in a VA national cemetery. As of December 20, 2013, VA was authorized to reconsider a prior decision to inter or memorialize an individual who was convicted of a Federal or State capital crime or tier III sex offense. In addition, VA was authorized to reconsider a prior decision to inter or memorialize an individual who committed a Federal or State capital crime but was not convicted of such crime because that individual was not available for trial due to death or flight to avoid prosecution. This proposed rule would implement review criteria and procedures for reconsideration of prior interment or memorialization decisions.
