## Summary

NMFS announces the closure of the Northern Gulf of Maine Scallop Management Area for the remainder of the 2022 fishing year for Limited Access General Category vessels. Regulations require this action once NMFS projects that 100 percent of the Limited Access General Category total allowable catch for the Northern Gulf of Maine Scallop Management Area will be harvested. This action is intended to prevent the overharvest of the 2022 total allowable catch allocated to the Limited Access General Category Fishery.
