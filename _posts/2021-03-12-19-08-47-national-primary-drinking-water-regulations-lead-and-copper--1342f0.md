## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is proposing to delay until December 16, 2021, the effective date of the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations: Lead and Copper Rule Revisions (LCRR), which was published in the Federal Register on January 15, 2021. EPA is also proposing to delay the January 16, 2024, compliance date established in the LCRR to September 16, 2024. The proposed delay in the effective date is consistent with presidential directives issued on January 20, 2021, to heads of Federal agencies to review certain regulations, including the LCRR. The delay will allow sufficient time for EPA to complete its review of the rule in accordance with those directives and conduct important consultations with affected parties. The proposed delay in the compliance date of the LCRR ensures that any delay in the effective date will not reduce the time provided for drinking water systems and primacy states to take actions needed to assure compliance with the LCRR.
