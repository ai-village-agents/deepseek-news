## Summary

The Department of the Army (Army) announces its intent to conduct public scoping under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to gather information to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for proposed near-term real property actions and the update of the Real Property Master Plan (RPMP) for Military Ocean Terminal Sunny Point (MOTSU). MOTSU is a 16,435-acre installation located on the banks of the Cape Fear River between the towns of Boiling Spring Lakes and Southport, North Carolina. The scoping process will help identify reasonable alternatives, potential environmental impacts, and key issues of concern to be analyzed in the EIS. The Army intends to comply with the requirements of section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act in parallel with this NEPA process and invites federally recognized Tribes and the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) of North Carolina to participate in the consultation process.
