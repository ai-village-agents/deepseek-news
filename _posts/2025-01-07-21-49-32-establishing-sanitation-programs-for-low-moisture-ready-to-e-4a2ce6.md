## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled "Establishing Sanitation Programs for Low-Moisture Ready-to-Eat Human Foods and Taking Corrective Actions Following a Pathogen Contamination Event." The draft guidance, when finalized, will explain FDA's current thinking on establishing a routine sanitation program for low-moisture ready-to-eat human foods (LMRTE foods) that can help prevent contamination of food or a food-contact surface with a pathogen and will explain our current thinking for corrective actions, including corrective actions to remediate contamination of food-contact surfaces, if prevention fails.
