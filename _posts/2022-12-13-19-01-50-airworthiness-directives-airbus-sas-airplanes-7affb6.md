## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-18-07, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A319-111, -112, - 113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, - 131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2019-18-07 requires repetitive rototest inspections of the open tack holes and rivet holes at the cargo floor support fittings of the fuselage, including doing all applicable related investigative actions and repair if necessary. AD 2019-18-07 also adds actions (modification) for certain airplanes. Since the FAA issued AD 2019-18-07, it was determined that certain airplanes need to do additional work. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2019-18-07 and would require additional work for certain airplanes, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
