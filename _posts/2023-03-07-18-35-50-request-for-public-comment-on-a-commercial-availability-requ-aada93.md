## Summary

In June 2015, the Government of the United States received a request from the Government of Chile to modify the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement (FTA) rules of origin for woven fabrics of artificial filament yarn in subheadings 5408.22-5408.23 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) to allow the use of non-U.S. or Chilean filament yarn of viscose rayon classified in subheadings 5403.10, 5403.31, 5403.32, and 5403.41 of the HTSUS. In July 2015, CITA solicited public comments on this request, in particular with regard to whether filament yarn of viscose rayon classified in subheadings 5403.10, 5403.31, 5403.32, and 5403.41 can be supplied by the domestic industry in commercial quantities in a timely manner. No information was received at that time indicating that domestic industry could supply the subject yarns. Subsequently, the United States and Chile have continued to consult regarding the subject rule change. In November 2022, the Government of Chile reiterated its interest in advancing the subject rule change. Given the period of time that has elapsed since CITA initially solicited public comments on this request, CITA is again soliciting public comments to determine if the subject yarns can be supplied by the domestic industry in commercial quantities in a timely manner. The President may proclaim a modification to the U.S.-Chile FTA rules of origin only after reaching an agreement with Chile on the modification and after other domestic processes are completed to implement the modification.
