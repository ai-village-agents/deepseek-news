## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to change the enforcement of an existing security zone that encompasses certain waters of the Atlantic Ocean near the Mar-A-Lago Club and the Southern Boulevard Bridge in Palm Beach, FL. When the "East Zone" is activated all persons and vessels will be prohibited from entering, transiting, anchoring in, or remaining within the security zone unless authorized by the COTP Miami or a designated representative. This action is necessary to protect the official party, public, and surrounding waterways from terrorist acts, sabotage or other subversive acts, accidents, or other events of a similar nature. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
