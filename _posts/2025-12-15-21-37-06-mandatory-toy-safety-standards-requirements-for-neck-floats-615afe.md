## Summary

Section 106(a) of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA) mandates that ASTM F963 shall be a mandatory toy safety standard. ASTM F963-23, however, does not establish specific performance requirements for aquatic toys, such as neck floats. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) is issuing this final rule establishing additional performance requirements specifically for neck floats and revised labeling requirements for neck floats to address fatal hazards associated with neck floats. The Commission is also amending CPSC's list of notice of requirements (NORs) to include neck floats.
