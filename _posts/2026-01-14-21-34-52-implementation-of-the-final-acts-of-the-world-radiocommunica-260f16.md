## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission or FCC) proposes to modify the Commission's rules to implement certain spectrum allocation decisions from the International Telecommunication Union's World Radiocommunication Conference's 2019 Final Acts concerning portions of the radio spectrum between 495 kHz and 50.9 GHz, make other allocation changes, and make related updates to our service rules in this frequency range. These proposals are designed to harmonize our spectrum allocations with and conform our rules to the World Radiocommunication's 2019 Final Acts to the extent that doing so would better meet domestic requirements.
