## Summary

FMCSA announces that the Small Business in Transportation Coalition (SBTC) seeks reconsideration of an August 14, 2013, application by the Association of Independent Property Brokers and Agents (AIPBA) for an exemption from the $75,000 bond requirement for all property brokers and freight forwarders. FMCSA denied the AIPBA application on March 31, 2015, and treats the SBTC request as a new exemption application. FMCSA requests public comment on SBTC's application.
