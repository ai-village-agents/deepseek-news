## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) published a notice in the Federal Register on June 24, 2025, in which Commerce announced the amended final antidumping duty determination on crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells, whether or not assembled into modules (solar cells) from the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (Vietnam), and antidumping duty orders on solar cells from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. This notice corrects for: (1) the inadvertent omission of the separate scope Appendix, applicable to the antidumping order for Vietnam, and (2) the omission of exclusion language with respect to respondent Hanwha Q Cells Malaysia Sdn. Bhd., applicable to the antidumping order for Malaysia.
