## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) announces its plan to submit the Information Collection Request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review and approval and invites public comment. The FMCSA requests approval to renew an ICR titled, "Hours of Service (HOS) of Drivers Regulations." The HOS regulations require a motor carrier to install, and requires each of its drivers subject to the record of duty status (RODS) rule to use, an electronic logging device (ELD) to report the driver's RODS. The RODS is critical to FMCSA's safety mission because it helps enforcement officials determine if commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers are complying with the HOS rules limiting driver on-duty and driving time and requiring periodic off-duty time.
