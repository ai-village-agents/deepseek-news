## Summary

On April 10, 2023, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) initiated the first sunset review of the antidumping duty (AD) order on carton-closing staples from China. Because no domestic interested party filed a timely notice of intent to participate in this sunset review, consistent with section 751(c)(3)(A) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), Commerce is revoking the AD order on carton-closing staples from China.
