## Summary

California has scheduled a Special General Election on March 19, 2024, to fill the U.S. House of Representatives seat in the 20th Congressional District vacated by Representative Kevin McCarthy. Under California law, a majority winner in a special election is declared elected. Should no candidate achieve a majority vote, a Special Runoff Election will be held on May 21, 2024, between the top two vote- getters. Political committees participating in the California special elections are required to file pre- and post-election reports. Filing deadlines for these reports are affected by whether one or two elections are held.
