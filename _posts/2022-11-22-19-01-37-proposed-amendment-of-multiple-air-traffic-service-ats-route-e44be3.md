## Summary

This action proposes to amend Jet Routes J-10, J-84, J-100, J- 128, J-144, and J-197, VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-172 and V-380, and Area Navigation (RNAV) route T-288; and revoke VOR Federal airway V-219. The FAA is proposing this action due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Wolbach, NE (OBH), VOR/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) navigational aid (NAVAID). The Wolbach VOR is being decommissioned in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
