## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is amending the test procedures for central air conditioners and heat pumps that will be required for certification of compliance with applicable energy conservation standards starting January 1, 2023, to address a limited number of specific issues, and making minor corrections to the current test procedures that are required for certification of compliance with applicable energy conservation standards prior to January 1, 2023. This rulemaking does not satisfy the 7-year lookback requirement prescribed by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act ("EPCA").
