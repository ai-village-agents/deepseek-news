## Summary

On behalf of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Secretary of the Interior proposes to withdraw 312.16 acres of public lands and 400 acres of Federal mineral interest underlying non-Federal surface from location and entry under the United States mining laws, but not from leasing under the mineral and geothermal leasing laws, to protect desert bighorn sheep habitat within the Red Rock Wildlife Area, for a period of 50 years, subject to valid existing rights. Publication of this notice segregates the lands for up to two years from location and entry under the United States mining laws, subject to valid existing rights, but not from leasing under the mineral and geothermal leasing laws, while the application is being processed. This notice initiates a 90-day public comment period and announces the opportunity to request a public meeting on the proposed withdrawal.
