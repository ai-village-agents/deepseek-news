## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is amending the final results of the administrative review of the countervailing duty (CVD) order on certain new pneumatic off-the-road tires (OTR tires) from India to correct ministerial errors. Based on the amended final results, we find that ATC Tires Private Limited (ATC) sold OTR tires in the United States at less than normal value during the period of review (POR), January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2022.
