## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve certain elements of a State Implementation Plan (SIP) submission from the State of Kansas addressing the applicable requirements of section 110 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) for the 2015 Ozone (O<INF>3</INF>) National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). Section 110 requires that each state adopt and submit a SIP revision to support the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of each new or revised NAAQS promulgated by the EPA. These SIPs are commonly referred to as "infrastructure" SIPs. The infrastructure requirements are designed to ensure that the structural components of each state's air quality management program are adequate to meet the state's responsibilities under the CAA.
