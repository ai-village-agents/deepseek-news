## Summary

This final rule revises the Legal Services Corporation's (LSC or Corporation) regulation prohibiting solicitation of clients. LSC adds definitions for the terms "communicate" and "communication," revises the existing text to make language more active, and clarifies how recipients may interact with client-eligible individuals. The main goal of these revisions is to formalize the interpretations of LSC's rule on solicitation that the Office of Legal Affairs (OLA) has issued over the past several years, making clear that recipients may inform client-eligible individuals about their rights and responsibilities and provide them with information about the recipients' intake processes, as well as how recipients may relay that information without violating either LSC's Fiscal Year 1996 appropriations statute or the rule prohibiting solicitation.
