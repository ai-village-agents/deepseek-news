## Summary

This notice announces that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has forwarded the Information Collection Request (ICR), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number 1652-0046, abstracted below, to OMB for review and approval of a revision of the currently approved collection under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). This ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected burden. The information collection involves passenger information that certain United States aircraft operators and foreign air carriers (collectively referred to in this document as "covered aircraft operators") submit to Secure Flight for the purposes of identifying and protecting against potential and actual threats to transportation security. To carry out this purpose, the information collection involves watch lists used by TSA to determine the prescreening status of individuals based on Secure Flight Passenger Data (SFPD) submitted by covered aircraft operators. TSA is revising this collection to reduce the number of non-governmental entities with access to the federal watch lists.
