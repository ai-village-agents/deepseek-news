## Summary

The Department of Justice ("DOJ" or "the Department") is making technical amendments to its regulations to conform to changes made by the Northern Mariana Islands U.S. Workforce Act of 2018 (Workforce Act). The Workforce Act, in part, extended the bar for asylum in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) by fifteen years, providing that the current bar will continue to apply for asylum applications submitted prior to January 1, 2030. This final rule makes the necessary conforming date changes in the Department's regulations.
