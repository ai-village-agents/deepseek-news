## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A330-200 series airplanes, Model A330-200 Freighter series airplanes, and Model A330-300 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that certain service information specified in AD 2018-20-19 contained instructions that could be misleading, resulting in a necessary inspection not being accomplished on certain airplanes. This AD requires a rototest for certain modified airplanes for any crack around the right-side upper and lower bulk door support or door latch fitting holes at certain bulk cargo door frames, or repetitive inspections for any crack at certain fittings, and on- condition actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
