## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC, Commission, or Agency) proposes to modify an existing system of records, FCC-2, Business Contacts and Certifications, subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. This action is necessary to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act to publish in the Federal Register notice of the existence and character of records maintained by the Agency. The Commission uses the information on individuals and businesses contained in the records in this system to collect and maintain points of contact at regulated entities and in related industries, and ensure compliance with FCC rules through certifications of information provided to the Commission. This modification expands the categories of individuals and record source categories of this system of records to include other Federal, state, local, U.S. territorial, and Tribal government entities and expands the purpose and routine uses of this system of records to include additional purposes for disclosing business contact and certification information and adding state, local, U.S. territorial, and Tribal government entities to the types of entities that may receive information from this system.
