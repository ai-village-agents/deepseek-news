## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is amending its regulations concerning its claims and appeals process governing various programs administered by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 (hereafter referred to as the AMA) amended the procedures applicable to administrative review and appeal of VA decisions on claims for benefits, creating a new, modernized review system. This amendment will sunset certain VHA regulations which are inconsistent with the AMA.
