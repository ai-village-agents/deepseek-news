## Summary

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in consultation with the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), proposes to promulgate regulations for the protection of Federal property. Within DHS, Federal Protective Service (FPS) maintains responsibility for the protection of buildings, grounds, and property owned, occupied, or secured by the Federal government. The proposed rule would adopt and revise the language of related-GSA regulations, consistent with DHS' statutory authority, to provide charging options for violations occurring on and adjacent to Federal property, update prohibited conduct to incorporate advancing technology, provide clearer public notice, and apply the regulations uniformly to all Federal property.
