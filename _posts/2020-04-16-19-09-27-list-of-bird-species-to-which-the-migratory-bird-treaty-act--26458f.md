## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, are publishing an amended list of the nonnative bird species that have been introduced by humans into the United States or U.S. territories and to which the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) does not apply. The Migratory Bird Treaty Reform Act (MBTRA) of 2004 amends the MBTA by stating that the MBTA applies only to migratory bird species that are native to the United States or U.S. territories, and that a native migratory bird species is one that is present as a result of natural biological or ecological processes. The MBTRA requires that we publish a list of all nonnative, human-introduced bird species to which the MBTA does not apply. We first published a list in 2005. We update the 2005 list with this notice. This notice identifies those species belonging to biological families referred to in treaties the MBTA implements that are not protected because their presence in the United States or U.S. territories is solely the result of intentional or unintentional human- assisted introductions. This notice presents an updated list of species not protected by the MBTA, which reflects current taxonomy, removes one species that no longer occurs in a protected family, and removes two species as a result of new distributional records documenting their natural occurrence in the United States.
