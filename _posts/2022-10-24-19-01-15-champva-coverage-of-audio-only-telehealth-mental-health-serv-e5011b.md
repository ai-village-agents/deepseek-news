## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes amending its medical regulations regarding Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA) coverage. This rulemaking would align with the Department of Defense for benefits administered through TRICARE and more closely align with requirements of other Federal programs. This rulemaking would remove the exclusion from CHAMPVA coverage for audio-only telehealth. In addition, we propose removing limitations on outpatient mental health visits as well as removing cost sharing requirements for certain contraceptive services and contraceptive products approved, cleared, or granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
