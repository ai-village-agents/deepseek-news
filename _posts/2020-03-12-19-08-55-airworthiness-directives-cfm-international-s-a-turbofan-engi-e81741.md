## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all CFM International S.A. (CFM) LEAP-1B21, -1B23, -1B25, -1B27, -1B28, - 1B28B1, -1B28B2, -1B28B2C, -1B28B3, -1B28BBJ1, and -1B28BBJ2 model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by reports of two new unsafe conditions and the need to supersede corrective actions for two previously addressed unsafe conditions. This AD supersedes AD 2018-25- 09 and AD 2019-12-01, which apply to the affected LEAP-1B model turbofan engines. This AD requires revising the Airworthiness Limitations Section (ALS) of the applicable CFM LEAP-1B Engine Shop Manual and the operator's approved continuous airworthiness maintenance program. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe conditions on these products.
