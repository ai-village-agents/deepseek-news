## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, Agency, or we) is amending certain classification regulations to reflect changes to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) made by the 21st Century Cures Act (the Cures Act). The Cures Act amended the definition of a device in the FD&C Act to exclude certain software functions. FDA is taking this action so that its regulations conform to the medical software provisions in the Cures Act.
