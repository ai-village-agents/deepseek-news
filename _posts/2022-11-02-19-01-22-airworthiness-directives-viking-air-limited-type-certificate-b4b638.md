## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Viking Air Limited (Viking) (type certificate previously held by Bombardier Inc. and de Havilland, Inc.) Model DHC-3 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a recent investigation of a Viking Model DHC-3 airplane where the lock ring of the stabilizer actuator was found missing. This AD requires a visual inspection of the stabilizer actuator to confirm that the stabilizer actuator lock ring is present, correctly seated in the groove in the upper housing, and engaged in the clamp nut, applicable corrective actions, and application of a torque seal. This AD also requires sending the inspection results to the FAA. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
