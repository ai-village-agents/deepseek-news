## Summary

In this document, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (WTB or Bureau) grants Anuvu Licensing Holdings, LLC's Petition for De Novo Review (Anuvu) and commences a hearing in connection with the 3.7-4.2 GHz Band (C-band) Transition Relocation Payment Clearinghouse's (RPC or clearinghouse) decision which denied Anuvu's cost reimbursement claims as they relate to its Raisting, Germany site. The issues designated for hearing are whether Anuvu met its burden of proof to demonstrate that the RPC erred in its finding that the claims were not compensable in- so-far as they relate to the Raisting site, which is located outside the United States; whether the RPC properly applied Commission guidance to the claims in question; and whether the disallowed amount of $960,694.35 should be reimbursed to Anuvu.
