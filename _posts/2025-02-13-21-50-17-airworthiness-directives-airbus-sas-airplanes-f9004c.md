# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus SAS Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A330-200, A330-200 Freighter, A330-300, A330-800, and A330-900 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by an incorrect shot peening application being implemented in production starting from 2008. This proposed AD would require repetitive detailed inspections (DET) of certain splice fittings and, depending on findings, repair, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
