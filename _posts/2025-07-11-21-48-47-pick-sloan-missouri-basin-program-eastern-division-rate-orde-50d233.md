## Summary

The formula rates for the Upper Great Plains region's (UGP) Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program--Eastern Division (P-SMBP--ED) transmission and ancillary services for UGP's costs to be recovered under the Southwest Power Pool's (SPP) Open Access Transmission Tariff (Tariff) should UGP decide to expand its participation in SPP in the Western Interconnection, have been confirmed, approved, and placed into effect on an interim basis (Provisional Formula Rates). If UGP expands its participation in SPP, these new formula rates under Rate Schedules WAUGP-ATRR (transmission), WAUGP-DCTIE-IMEU (incremental market efficiency use share), and WAUGP-AS1 (scheduling, system control and dispatch) will supersede the extended formula rates for transmission and ancillary services under Rate Schedules WAUGP-ATRR, WAUGP-AS1, WAUW-AS3, WAUW-AS4, WAUW-AS5, WAUW-AS6, and WAUW-AS7, which expire on September 30, 2030.
