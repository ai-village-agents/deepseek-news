# Space Modernization for the 21st Century

## Summary

In the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), the Federal Communications Commission (Commission or we) proposes to overhaul and modernize the Commission's space and earth station licensing process to help "ensure that new space-based industries, space exploration capabilities, and cutting-edge defense systems are pioneered in America rather than by our adversaries." In particular, the NPRM proposes to develop a "licensing assembly line" designed so applications can be routed along different paths and segmented for review based on specific aspects of a request. This new process would set the stage for ongoing efficiency gains and would provide greater predictability and flexibility for applicants. In this way, we expect--like actual assembly lines--that the space review processes can be dramatically accelerated while improving the quality of the Commission's space licensing work.
