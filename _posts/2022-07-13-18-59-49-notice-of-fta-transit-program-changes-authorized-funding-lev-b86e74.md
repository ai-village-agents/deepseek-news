## Summary

On April 28, 2022, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) published a notice in the Federal Register apportioning funds appropriated by law. The notice provided information on the FY 2022 funding available for the FTA assistance programs, and provides program guidance and requirements. This notice provides a needed correction to that notice regarding pre-award authority, FY 2022 Section 5311 Formula Grants for Rural Areas Program and Rural Transportation Assistance Program funding, and the expenditure deadline for the FY 2015 Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER VII) Discretionary Grants.
