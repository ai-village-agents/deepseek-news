## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled 2022 Ebola Traveler Follow Up Evaluation. Information collected will be used to gather feedback from state and local health department partners on CDC's interim guidance and post-arrival management of travelers and to assess the quality of contact information provided to states.
