## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), in the Department of Health and Human Services, requests public input on priority topics related to firefighter safety and health. Through its Center for Firefighter Safety, Health, and Well-Being, NIOSH conducts research and provides services to identify and help prevent new and emerging hazards in the fire service earlier and faster. As the threat from structural, wildland urban interface, and wildland fires grows, NIOSH seeks input to help refine its existing research and engagement priorities. This request is for information-gathering purposes and does not propose new regulations, requirements, or policies.
