## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) seeks comment to refresh the record in the rulemaking on Modernizing and Expanding Access to the 70/80/90 GHz Bands (85 FR 40168, July 6, 2020; 86 FR 60436, Nov. 2, 2021) to address the potential for use of the 71-76 GHz, 81-86 GHz, 92-94 GHz, and the 94.1- 95 GHz (70/80/90 GHz) bands to provide broadband internet access to consumers and communities that may otherwise lack robust, consistent connectivity. Specifically, the Commission previously proposed new and updated rules to further enable non-Federal uses of the 70/80/90 GHz bands, which are currently allocated on a co-primary basis for Federal and non-Federal use. This document seeks to refresh the overall record in the docket and seeks comment, in particular, on the proposals made in a filing by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) on October 17, 2023 (NTIA October 17 Filing). In that filing, NTIA proposed technical rules and interference mitigation measures, including operating parameters for links to endpoints in motion in 71-76 GHz and 81-86 GHz, to protect current or planned Federal operations in these frequencies and in adjacent bands.
