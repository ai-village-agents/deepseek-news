## Summary

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) proposes to amend its retirement regulations to revise the definition of secondary position for law enforcement officers, firefighters, nuclear materials couriers, and customs and border protection officers. The changes remove the requirement that experience in a primary position is a mandatory prerequisite for an executive level position. This change will provide agencies with greater flexibility when recruiting for executive positions. Agencies retain the discretion to require experience in a primary position as a mandatory prerequisite to their secondary positions.
