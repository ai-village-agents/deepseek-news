## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission is publishing the Chair's agenda of rulemaking actions pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164) (Sept. 19, 1980). The items listed in the Regulatory Flexibility Agenda for Spring 2023 reflect only the priorities of the Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and do not necessarily reflect the views and priorities of any individual Commissioner. Information in the agenda was accurate on April 10, 2023, the date on which the Commission's staff completed compilation of the data. To the extent possible, rulemaking actions by the Commission since that date have been reflected in the agenda. The Commission invites questions and public comment on the agenda and on the individual agenda entries. The Commission is now printing in the Federal Register, along with our preamble, only those agenda entries for which we have indicated that preparation of an RFA analysis is required. The Commission's complete RFA agenda will be available online at www.reginfo.gov.
