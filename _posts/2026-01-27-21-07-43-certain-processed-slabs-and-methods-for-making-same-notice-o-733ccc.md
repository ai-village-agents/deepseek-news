Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on December 19, 2025, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of Cambria Company LLC of Belle Plaine, Minnesota. A supplement to the complaint was filed on January 5, 2026. The complaint, as supplemented, alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain processed slabs and methods for making same by reason of the infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 10,195,762 ("the '762 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 10,252,440 ("the '440 patent"); and U.S. Patent No. 12,370,718 ("the '718 patent").
