## Summary

This rule temporarily suspends the continuance referendum requirement under the Federal marketing order for California raisins. The continuance referendum scheduled between November 2023 and November 2025 overlaps with the timeframe the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) plans to conduct a formal rulemaking to amend the marketing order. This suspension delays the enforcement of the continuance referendum requirement to give precedence to the formal rulemaking process, which may include a producer referendum. In addition, if the marketing order is amended, this temporary suspension provides industry time to operate under the amended marketing order before the next scheduled continuance referendum.
