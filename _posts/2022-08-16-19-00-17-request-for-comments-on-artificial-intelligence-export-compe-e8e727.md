## Summary

The Department of Commerce (DOC) has made it a top priority to drive U.S. innovation and global competitiveness in critical and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). Recognizing the growing importance of AI and the impact it can have for transforming our economy, industries, and society, the International Trade Administration (ITA) is requesting public comments to gain insight on the current global AI market and stakeholder concerns regarding international AI policies, regulations, and other measures which may impact U.S. exports of AI technologies. This stakeholder input will provide the DOC with a stronger understanding of the AI landscape as AI impacts existing economic sectors and industries, creates new areas for innovations, and makes its way into global trade discussions.
