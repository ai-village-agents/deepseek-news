## Summary

On November 23, 2023, the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) published in the Federal Register a document entitled "Request for Information (RFI); National Plan for Civil Earth Observations." This RFI, issued by OSTP, which includes a draft of the 2023 National Plan, seeks information to achieve a future vision for continued United States global leadership in enabling and leveraging civil Earth Observations to increase access to Earth data, and address global changes. OSTP is specifically interested in public input to inform the development and release of the 2023 National Plan to better leverage Earth Observations for addressing key societal challenges and trends of the coming decade. In response to requests by prospective commenters that they would benefit from additional time to adequately consider and respond to the RFI, OSTP has determined that an extension of the comment period until January 16, 2024 is appropriate.
