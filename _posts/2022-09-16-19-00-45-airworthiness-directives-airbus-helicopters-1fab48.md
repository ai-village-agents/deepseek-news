## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Airbus Helicopters Model SA341G and SA342J helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of manufacturing defects on multiple tail rotor blades (TRBs). This AD requires visually inspecting certain part- numbered TRBs for the presence of a linear indication; and depending on the inspection results, fluorescent penetrant inspecting the TRB and further corrective actions if necessary. This AD also prohibits installing an affected TRB unless certain requirements have been met, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
