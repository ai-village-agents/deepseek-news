## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2013-25- 11, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A318-111, -112, -121, and - 122 airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-111, -211, -212, -214, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2013-25-11 required repetitive inspections of the 80VU rack lower lateral fittings, upper fittings, and shelves for damage, repetitive inspections of the 80VU rack lower central support for cracking, and corrective action if necessary. AD 2013-25-11 also specified optional terminating action for the repetitive inspections. Since the FAA issued AD 2013-25-11, new damage occurrences have been reported, and a different compliance time has been determined for certain inspections, depending on airplane configuration. This AD expands the applicability, removes the optional terminating action, and requires new repetitive inspections; as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
