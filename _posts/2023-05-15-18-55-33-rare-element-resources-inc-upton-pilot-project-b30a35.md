## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) received a license application from Rare Element Resources, Inc. which authorizes possession and use of source material associated with its Upton Pilot Project. The Upton Pilot Project includes a mined ore pile in the Black Hills National Forest in Crook County, Wyoming for the purpose of extracting rare earth element ores, and a rare earth element processing plant in Upton, Wyoming. Because the license application contains Sensitive Unclassified Non-Safeguards Information (SUNSI), an order imposes procedures to obtain access to this type of information for contention preparation.
