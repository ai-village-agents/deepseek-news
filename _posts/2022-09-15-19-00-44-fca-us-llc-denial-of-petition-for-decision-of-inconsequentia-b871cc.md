## Summary

FCA US, LLC, (f/k/a Chrysler Group, LLC) "FCA," has determined that certain Mopar branded headlamp assemblies sold as aftermarket equipment and installed as original equipment in certain model year (MY) 2017-2018 Dodge Journey motor vehicles do not fully comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 108, Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated Equipment. FCA filed a noncompliance report for the replacement equipment dated March 14, 2019, and later amended it on April 9, 2019. FCA also filed a noncompliance report for the associated vehicles dated March 14, 2019, and later amended it on April 9, 2019, and April 25, 2019. FCA subsequently petitioned NHTSA (the "Agency") on April 5, 2019, and filed a supplemental petition on May 14, 2019, for a decision that the subject noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. This document announces the denial of FCA's petition.
