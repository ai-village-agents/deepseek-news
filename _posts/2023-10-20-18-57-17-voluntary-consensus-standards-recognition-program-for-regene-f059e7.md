## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance entitled "Voluntary Consensus Standards Recognition Program for Regenerative Medicine Therapies; Guidance for Industry." The guidance document describes a standards recognition program for regenerative medicine therapies (SRP-RMT) at FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) designed to identify Voluntary Consensus Standards (VCS) that might be used in the preparation and evaluation of submissions for Regenerative Medicine Therapy (RMT) products regulated by CBER when such standards are appropriate. The use of recognized VCS can assist stakeholders in more efficiently meeting regulatory requirements and increasing regulatory predictability for RMT products. This program is modeled after the formal standards and conformity assessment program (S-CAP) for medical devices where the term "recognize" refers to FDA's formal identification of a standard after the determination that the standard is appropriate to meet relevant requirements as defined by law. CBER encourages the use of appropriate standards in the development of CBER- regulated products. The guidance announced in this notice finalizes the draft guidance of the same title dated June 2022.
