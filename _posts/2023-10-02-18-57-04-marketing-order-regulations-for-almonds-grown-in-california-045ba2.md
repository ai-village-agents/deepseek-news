## Summary

This rule implements a recommendation from the Almond Board of California (Board) to change multiple provisions in the administrative requirements prescribed under the Federal marketing order regulating the handling of almonds grown in California (Order). This action amends administrative requirements regulating quality control, exempt dispositions, and interest and late charges provisions. In addition, the rule stays two sections of the administrative requirements that define almond butter and stipulate disposition in reserve outlets by handlers to facilitate the efficient administration of the Order.
