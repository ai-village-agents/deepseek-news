## Summary

In this document, the Commission announces that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved four information collections associated with rules governing Priority Access Licenses (PALs) in the 3550-3700 MHz (3.5 GHz) band in the 2016 Order on Reconsideration and Second Report and Order, FCC 16-55, in GN Docket No. 12-354, and 2018 Report and Order, FCC 18-149, in GN Docket No. 17-258. The Commission also announces that compliance with the rules is now required. It removes paragraphs advising that compliance was not required until OMB approval was obtained. This document is consistent with the 2016 Order on Reconsideration and Second Report and Order and 2018 Report and Order, which state the Commission will publish a document in the Federal Register announcing a compliance date for the rule sections and revise the rules accordingly.
