## Summary

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) proposes to revise its regulations to conform with the Fair Hiring in Banking Act (FHBA)--which was enacted on and immediately effective as of December 23, 2022. Among other provisions, the FHBA excluded or exempted categories of otherwise-covered offenses from the scope of statutory prohibitions on participation in banking. These categories pertain to certain older offenses, offenses committed by individuals 21 or younger, and "certain lesser offenses." The FHBA also clarified several definitions in section 19 and provided application-processing procedures. The FDIC considers most of the proposed revisions to its regulations to be required by the FHBA. Other proposed revisions reflect the FDIC's interpretation of statutory prohibitions in light of the FHBA.
