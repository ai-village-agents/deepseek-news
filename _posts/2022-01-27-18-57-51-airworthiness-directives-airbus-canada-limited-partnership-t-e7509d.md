## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500- 1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report indicating that during production, the manual opening and closing of the over-wing emergency exit door (OWEED) prior to the installation of the OWEED interior panel could have resulted in damaged insulation blankets below the left and right OWEEDs. This AD requires a one-time inspection for damage of the insulation blankets below the left and right OWEEDs, and replacement if necessary, as specified in a Transport Canada Civil Aviation (TCCA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
