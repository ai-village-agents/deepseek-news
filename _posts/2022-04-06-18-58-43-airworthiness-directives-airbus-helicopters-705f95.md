## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model AS33L2 and EC225LP helicopters. This AD was prompted by a discrepancy in the rotorcraft flight manual (RFM) where the rotorcraft stay-up flying capabilities for Category B operation were provided through performance data only, not as airworthiness limitations that are dependent upon on the number of passengers on board. This AD requires revising the existing RFM for your helicopter, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
