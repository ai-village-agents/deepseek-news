## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") proposes to establish and amend the certification provisions, labeling requirements, and enforcement provisions for specific types of consumer products and commercial and industrial equipment, as described in sections II and III of this proposed rule. DOE is proposing to establish and make amendments to the certification requirements, labeling requirements, and enforcement provisions for these products and equipment to ensure reporting that is consistent with currently applicable energy conservation standards and test procedures and to ensure DOE has the information necessary to determine the appropriate classification of products for the application of standards. DOE seeks comment from interested parties on all aspects of this proposal.
