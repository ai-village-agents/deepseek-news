## Summary

The Coast Guard is modifying a temporary deviation from the operating schedule that governs the Florida East Coast (FEC) Railroad Bridge, across the Okeechobee Waterway (OWW), mile 7.41, at Stuart, Florida. This modification tests an alternate temporary deviation to determine if the updated mobile application and simplified drawbridge opening requirements are reliable and predictable and will meet the reasonable needs of navigation and competing modes of transportation given the increase in railway activity. The Coast Guard is seeking comments from the public regarding this deviation.
