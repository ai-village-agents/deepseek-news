## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is conducting a retrospective review of administrative requirements to identify outdated or duplicative administrative requirements that may be eliminated without an adverse effect on public health or safety, common defense and security, protection of the environment, or regulatory efficiency and effectiveness. The NRC is requesting input from its licensees and members of the public on any administrative requirements that may be outdated or duplicative in nature. The NRC will use five criteria to evaluate any public input under this retrospective review of administrative requirements initiative for possible revision or elimination to reduce burden on regulated entities and the NRC.
