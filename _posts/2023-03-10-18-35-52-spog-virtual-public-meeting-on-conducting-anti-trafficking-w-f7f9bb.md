## Summary

The Department of State, on behalf of the interagency Senior Policy Operating Group (SPOG), is hosting a virtual public meeting to hear input about how it can conduct its anti-trafficking work using a racial justice and equity lens and to assist the SPOG and SPOG agencies implementation of Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government and Further Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government. This public meeting is part of the SPOG's ongoing efforts to engage and collaborate with diverse communities and develop an implementation plan for integrating racial equity into U.S. government anti-trafficking efforts and is meant to complement the SPOG's prior request for written information (87 FR 7231) to provide members of the public with another way to share feedback with the U.S. government. The implementation plan will highlight the importance of an intersectional approach, as racism often compounds with other forms of discrimination to affect individuals' vulnerability to human trafficking. Additionally, it will complement agencies' individual work to implement Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce by sharing information and practices for increasing diversity in the federal workforce as an integral way to strengthen agencies' anti-trafficking work.
