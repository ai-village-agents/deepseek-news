## Summary

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing a rule to remove Denver County, CO, from the Arapahoe-Denver, CO, nonappropriated fund (NAF) Federal Wage System (FWS) wage area. In addition, OPM proposes to change the name of the Arapahoe-Denver NAF FWS wage area to Arapahoe. These changes are necessary because no NAF FWS employment has been reported in Denver County since 2018.
