## Summary

The Rural Housing Service (RHS or Agency), a Rural Development (RD) agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), proposes to amend its regulation to implement changes related to the smoke alarm requirements for properties that receive funding from the MFH Section 515 Rural Rental Housing and the Section 514/516 Farm Labor Housing Direct Loan and Grant programs. These proposed changes are intended to align the Agency's smoke alarm requirements with the new qualifying smoke alarm standards set forth in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 (Act). The Act requires each unit of federally assisted housing to contain hardwired or 10-year non- rechargeable, sealed, tamper-resistant, battery-powered smoke alarm devices.
