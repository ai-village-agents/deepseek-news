## Summary

The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) will host a public online forum to enable public discussion of the Institute's proposal to establish the Section on Mechanics and Tissue Remodeling Integrating Computational & Experimental Systems (MATRICES). The proposed reorganization will more accurately reflect the current structure by which the Intramural Research Program is functioning and improve the coordination of the scientific activities within the Institute. The online forum will allow members of the public to review the reorganization proposal and submit comments.
