## Summary

The Coast Guard is extending the effective period of a temporary, 500-yard radius, moving security zone for a vessel carrying Certain Dangerous Cargo (CDC) within Puget Sound. This temporary security zone is needed to protect the vessel, the CDC, and the surrounding waterway from terrorist acts, sabotage, or other subversive acts, accidents, or other events of a similar nature. Entry of vessels or persons into this zone is prohibited while the Motor Vessel (M/V) GREEN RIDGE is in transit unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port Puget Sound (COTP) or a designated representative.
