## Summary

The Department of Education (Department) proposes priorities, requirements, and a definition under the Project Prevent grant program, Assistance Listing Number (ALN) 84.184M. We may use one or more of these priorities, requirements, and definition for competitions in fiscal year (FY) 2022 and later years. We propose priorities and requirements designed to direct funds toward local educational agencies (LEAs) impacted by community violence and to expand the capacity of LEAs to implement community- and school-based strategies to help prevent community violence and mitigate the impacts of exposure to community violence. The Department also proposes to define "community violence" for purposes of the Project Prevent grant program.
