## Summary

The Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment, Division of Environmental Quality (DEQ) has submitted updated regulations for receiving delegation and approval of its program for the implementation and enforcement of certain National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) promulgated under the Clean Air Act (CAA), as provided for under the delegation mechanism previously approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA is approving DEQ's requested update of its NESHAP delegation. The delegation will only encompass sources subject to one or more Federal section 112 standards which are also subject to the requirements of the Title V operating permits program. The updated State regulations regard certain NESHAP, as they existed through July 31, 2020. The EPA is providing notice that it is taking final action to approve the delegation of certain NESHAP to DEQ.
