## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-700, -800, and -900ER series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of unshimmed gaps at a certain inner chord. This proposed AD would require a general visual inspection for repairs of a certain inner chord, a detailed inspection for unshimmed gaps of the frame inner chord, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
