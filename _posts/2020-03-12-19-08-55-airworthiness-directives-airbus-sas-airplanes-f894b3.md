## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A330-941 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports indicating premature aging of certain chemical oxygen generators. This AD requires repetitively removing the affected chemical oxygen generators and replacing them with serviceable parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
