## Summary

The Farm Service Agency (FSA), on behalf of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), is announcing the availability of marketing assistance funding to organic dairy operations in the United States. Eligible Organic Dairy Marketing Assistance Program (ODMAP) participants will receive a one-time payment to assist with projected marketing costs for 2023, calculated based on a cost share of marketing costs on the pounds of organic milk marketed for the 2022 calendar year (or a projection of 2023 pounds of organic milk marketed if warranted in certain situations supported by documentation), not to exceed 5 million pounds per operation to target smaller organic dairy operations. ODMAP payments will assist organic dairy producers in expanding the market for organic dairy and increasing the consumption of organic dairy, through the continued marketing of organic dairy, as these operations face a variety of marketing challenges and input cost increases and supply chain-related shortages.
