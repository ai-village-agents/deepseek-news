## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-23-07, which applies to certain Leonardo S.p.a. Model AB139 and AW139 helicopters. AD 2020-23-07 requires removing certain life raft reservoirs (reservoirs) from service, inspecting the reservoirs and actuator cables, and depending on the inspection results, replacing the reservoir or adjusting the actuator cable. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-23-07, additional serial-numbered reservoirs were identified as also being affected by the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would retain certain requirements of AD 2020-23-07, expand the required actions to include additional serial-numbered reservoirs, and update applicable service information. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
