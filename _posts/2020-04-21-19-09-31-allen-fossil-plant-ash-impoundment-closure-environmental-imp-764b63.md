## Summary

This notice is provided in accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality's regulations and Tennessee Valley Authority's (TVA's) procedures for implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). TVA has decided to adopt the Preferred Alternative identified in the Allen Fossil Plant (ALF) Ash Impoundment Closure Environmental Impact Statement. The Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was made available to the public on March 6, 2020. A Notice of Availability of the Final EIS was published in the Federal Register on March 13, 2020. The Preferred Alternative is "Closure of the Metal Cleaning Pond, Closure-by-Removal of the East Ash Pond Complex and the West Ash Pond; Disposal of CCR in an Offsite Landfill Location." This alternative would achieve the purpose and need of the project to support the implementation of TVA's goal to eliminate all wet Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) storage at its coal plants; close CCR surface impoundments across the TVA system; comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's CCR Rule and other applicable federal and state statutes and regulations; and enhance future economic development in the greater Memphis area.
