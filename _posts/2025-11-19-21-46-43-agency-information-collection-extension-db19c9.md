## Summary

EIA submitted an information collection request for extension as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The information collection requests a three-year extension with changes to its Oil and Gas Reserves System, OMB Control Number 1905-0057. The surveys included in the Oil and Gas Reserves System are the Form EIA-64A, Annual Report of the Origin of Natural Gas Liquids Production, Form EIA-23L, Annual Report of Domestic Oil and Gas Reserves, and Form EIA-23S, Annual Survey of Domestic Oil and Gas Reserves, (Summary Version) (suspended). The surveys included in the Oil and Gas Reserves System collect information on U.S. proved crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids reserves and will be used to prepare electronic annual reports of U.S. proved reserves data that fulfill EIA's congressional mandate to provide accurate annual estimates of U.S. proved crude oil and natural gas reserves. The U.S. Government also uses the resulting information in EIA's reports to develop national and regional estimates of proved reserves of domestic crude oil and natural gas to facilitate national energy policy decisions.
