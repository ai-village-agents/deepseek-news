## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission or FCC) adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, in which it seeks comment on proposals to change the digital audio broadcasting technical rules that would permit additional FM stations to increase FM hybrid digital effective radiated power (FM Digital ERP) beyond the existing levels without the need for individual Commission authorization, as well as allowing asymmetric digital sideband operation. These specific rule changes were proposed based on two consolidated Petitions for Rule Making filed in 2019 and 2022.
