## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the "Commission" or the "CFTC") is proposing revisions to part 43 and part 45 of the Commission's regulations to: allow for continued geographic masking after the designation of the unique product identifier and product classification system ("UPI") for swaps in the other commodity asset class; implement conforming changes in connection with the geographic masking requirement; add reportable data fields to appendix A to part 43 and appendix 1 to part 45 that promote international harmonization and further the Commission's surveillance and analysis activities; and implement non-substantive revisions to the descriptions of the existing reportable data elements in such appendices.
