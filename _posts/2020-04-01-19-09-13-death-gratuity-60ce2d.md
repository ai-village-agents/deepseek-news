# Death Gratuity

## Summary

This final rule removes the Department of the Navy (DON) regulation requiring the Secretary of the Navy to pay a death gratuity between $800 and $3,000 upon the death of a member of the naval service while on active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training. That benefit is enumerated in both U.S. Code and the Department of Defense (DoD) Financial Management Regulation. The DoD and DON have robust procedures for responding to the death of a service member. This part has been determined to be duplicative of statute and internal policy, thus it should be removed from the CFR.
