## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing the approval of a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Alabama, through the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM), via a letter dated February 2, 2021. The SIP revision includes the 2006 24-hour fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) Limited Maintenance Plan (LMP) for the Birmingham, Alabama maintenance area (Birmingham Area or Area). The Birmingham 2006 24-hour PM<INF>2.5</INF> maintenance area is comprised of Jefferson County, Shelby County, and a portion of Walker County. EPA is approving the Birmingham Area LMP because it provides for the maintenance of the 2006 24-hour PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS within the Birmingham Area through the end of the second 10-year portion of the maintenance period. The effect of this action would be to make certain commitments related to maintenance of the 2006 24-hour PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS in Birmingham federally enforceable as part of the Alabama SIP. EPA is also notifying the public of the status of EPA's adequacy determination, consistent with the requirements in the transportation conformity rule, for this LMP.
