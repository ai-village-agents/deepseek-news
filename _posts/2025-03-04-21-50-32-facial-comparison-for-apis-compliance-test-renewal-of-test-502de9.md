## Summary

This notice announces that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is renewing the Facial Comparison for Advance Passenger Information System (APIS) Compliance Test. Commercial air and sea carriers that voluntarily participate in this test use CBP's Traveler Verification Service (TVS) to comply with APIS regulatory requirements. During this test, participating carriers will use the existing TVS to ensure the manifest information sent to CBP is correct and to perform the required identity verification pursuant to APIS regulations. This process has the potential to expedite the departure process as compared to the manual data and identity verification process.
