## Summary

MARAD is issuing a limited waiver of the Buy American Act requirements for non-domestic marine loading arms for the Port of Corpus Christi Authority's (PCCA) Avery Point Public Oil Docks Redevelopment--Phase 1: Expanding Oil Dock 3 project, which received funding under the FY 2019 Port Infrastructure Development Program (PIDP). The Buy American Act requires that manufactured articles, materials, or supplies be manufactured in the United States substantially all from articles, materials, or supplies mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States. The final waiver applies only to the procurement of eight non-domestic 8-inch diameter manually operated marine loading arms based on nonavailability.
