## Summary

The Bureau of the Fiscal Service within the Department of the Treasury (Fiscal Service or Treasury) proposes to adopt regulations to implement statutory requirements under the SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 requiring Treasury to provide information on applicable savings bonds to states. A state receiving the information with respect to an applicable savings bond may use the information to locate the owner of the bond pursuant to Treasury's regulations and the state's own standards and requirements under abandoned property rules and regulations of the state. Regulations adopted by Treasury are required to protect the privacy of savings bond owners, prevent fraud, and ensure that any information disclosed to a state under these rules shall be used solely to locate savings bond owners.
