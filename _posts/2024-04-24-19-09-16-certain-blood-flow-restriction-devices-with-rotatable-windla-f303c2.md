## Summary

Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission ("Commission") has determined that the March 19, 2024, initial determination ("ID") (Order No. 23) issued by the presiding administrative law judge ("ALJ") granting a motion to withdraw Complainants' request for a general exclusion order ("GEO") in connection with the asserted trademarks and trade dress and to cancel the evidentiary hearing is properly issued in the form of an order rather than an initial determination. Order No. 23 also includes the ALJ's recommended determination ("RD") on remedy and bonding, and thus, the Commission requests written submissions from the parties, interested government agencies, and other interested persons on the issues of remedy, the public interest, and bonding, under the schedule set forth below.
