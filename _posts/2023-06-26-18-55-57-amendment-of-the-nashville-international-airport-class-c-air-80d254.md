# Amendment of the Nashville International Airport Class C Airspace; Nashville, TN; and the John C. Tune Airport Class D Airspace; Nashville, TN

**Published:** February 05, 2026 18:55 UTC

**Document Number:** 2023-13388

## Summary

This action corrects a final rule published by the FAA in the Federal Register on June 6, 2023, that amended the Nashville International Airport Class C airspace area and the John C. Tune Class D airspace area. In the final rule, the words "(when active)" were inadvertently omitted from the sentences that exclude the Smyrna Airport Class D airspace from the Nashville Class C airspace area. The error would cause the incorrect depiction of the Class C and Class D airspace areas on aeronautical charts. This action corrects that error.
