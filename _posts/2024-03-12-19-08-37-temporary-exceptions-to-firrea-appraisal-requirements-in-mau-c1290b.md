## Summary

The Depository Institutions Disaster Relief Act of 1992 (DIDRA) authorizes the agencies to make exceptions to statutory and regulatory appraisal requirements under Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) relating to transactions involving real property located within an area in a state or territory declared to be a major disaster by the President. In this statement and order, the agencies exercise their authority to grant temporary exceptions to the FIRREA appraisal requirements for real estate-related financial transactions, provided certain criteria are met, in an area in the State of Hawaii following the major disaster declared by President Biden as a result of wildfires. The expiration date for the exceptions is August 10, 2026, which is three years after the date the President declared the major disaster.
