## Summary

The Federal Maritime Commission (Commission) amends its regulations governing Carrier Automated Tariffs. The final rule removes the option for common carriers to charge a fee to access their tariff; allow non-vessel-operating common carriers (NVOCCs) to cross-reference certain aspects of other carriers' terms in their tariffs; clarify the ability for NVOCCs to reflect increases in certain charges passed- through by other entities without notice; revise regulations to specify permissible relationships between NVOCCs for the co-loading of cargo, and makes other miscellaneous updates and clarifications to the regulation, including removing outdated citations.
