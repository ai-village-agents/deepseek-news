## Summary

This final rule revises regulations for fish and shellfish seasons, harvest limits, methods, and means related to taking of fish and shellfish for subsistence uses during the 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 regulatory years. The Federal Subsistence Board (hereafter referred to as "the Board") is on a schedule of completing the process of revising subsistence taking of fish and shellfish regulations in odd- numbered years and subsistence taking of wildlife regulations in even- numbered years; public proposal and review processes take place during the preceding year. The Board also addresses customary and traditional use determinations during the applicable cycle. When final, the resulting rulemaking amends the existing subsistence fish and shellfish taking regulations. This final rule also revises the nonrural determinations, updates the regulations on subsistence taking of wildlife resulting from final Board action on a wildlife proposal to conduct an ANILCA section 804 user prioritization for hunting the Nelchina caribou herd, change Nelchina caribou herd subsistence hunts to "may be announced," and delegate authority to manage these hunts. Lastly, this rule corrects an error from a recent final rule.
