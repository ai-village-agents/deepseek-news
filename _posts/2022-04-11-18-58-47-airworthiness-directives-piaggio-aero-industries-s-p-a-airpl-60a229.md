## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Piaggio Aero Industries S.p.A (Piaggio) Model P-180 airplanes. This proposed AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as accumulation of water and subsequent freezing in the pitot-tube, which results in pitot-tube blockage. This proposed AD would require modifying the total air temperature (TAT) probe heater electrical circuit and revising your existing airplane flight manual (AFM). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
