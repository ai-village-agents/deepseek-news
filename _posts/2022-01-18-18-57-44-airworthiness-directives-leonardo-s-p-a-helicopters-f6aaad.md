## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Leonardo S.p.a. Model AW169 helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of a broken adjustable device that is part of the pilot and co- pilot yaw pedal assemblies. This AD requires modification of certain pilot and co-pilot yaw pedal assemblies with an improved design and re- identification of affected parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
