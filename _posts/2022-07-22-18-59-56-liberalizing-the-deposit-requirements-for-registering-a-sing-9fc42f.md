## Summary

The U.S. Copyright Office is amending the rules for registering a single issue of a serial publication, such as an individual issue of a magazine or journal. Under the current regulations, two copies of the best edition are generally needed to register this type of work, and must be in a physical format if the issue was published in that form. The amended rule will liberalize the deposit requirements by letting copyright owners submit one copy of such works instead of two. It also gives copyright owners the option of uploading a digital copy through the electronic registration system, even if the issue was published in a physical format. Alternatively, copyright owners may mail one copy to the Office in a physical format, although mailing a physical copy will delay the examination of the claim and result in a later effective date of registration.
