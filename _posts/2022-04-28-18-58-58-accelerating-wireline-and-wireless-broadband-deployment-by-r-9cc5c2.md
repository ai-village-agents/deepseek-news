## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) seeks comment on measures that the Commission may adopt to better align the financial incentives of utilities and attachers with respect to pole replacements. Specifically, the Commission seeks comment on the circumstances in which attachers should not be required to pay the entire cost of pole replacements needed to accommodate their new attachments and the proper allocation of costs in those situations, whether and how the Commission should revise its rules to address pole replacement cost issues, whether there are changes the Commission could make to its rules that would help utilities and attachers avoid disputes and expedite the resolution of pole attachment complaints, and the appropriate scope of refunds ordered by the Commission when it determines that a pole attachment rate, term, or condition is unjust and unreasonable.
