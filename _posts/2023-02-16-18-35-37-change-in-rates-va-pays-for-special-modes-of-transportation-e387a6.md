## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) amends its beneficiary travel regulations to establish a new payment methodology for special modes of transportation. The new payment methodology will apply in the absence of a contract between VA and a vendor of the special mode of transportation. For transport by ambulance, VA will pay the lesser of the actual charge or the amount determined by the Medicare Part B Ambulance Fee Schedule established by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. For travel by modes other than ambulance, VA will establish a payment methodology based on States' posted rates or the actual charge.
