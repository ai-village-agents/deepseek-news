## Summary

This agenda announces the proposed regulatory actions the Department of Defense (DOD) plans for the next 12 months and those completed since the spring 2020 agenda. It was developed under the guidelines of Executive Order 12866 "Regulatory Planning and Review," Executive Order 13771 "Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs," and Executive Order 13563 "Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review." This Agenda documents DOD's work under Executive Order 13777 "Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda," and many regulatory actions support the recommendations of the DoD Regulatory Reform Task Force (as indicated in the individual rule abstracts). This Agenda also includes regulatory actions the Department is taking to address the current worldwide pandemic. These include efforts to ensure TRICARE beneficiaries have access to the most up-to-date care required for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. Members of the public may submit comments on individual proposed and interim final rulemakings at www.regulations.gov during the comment period that follows publication in the Federal Register. This agenda updates the report published on June 30, 2020, and includes regulations expected to be issued and under review over the next 12 months. The next agenda will publish in the spring of 2021. The complete Unified Agenda will be available online at www.reginfo.gov. Because publication in the Federal Register is mandated for the regulatory flexibility agendas required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 602), the Department of Defense's printed agenda entries include only: (1) Rules that are in the Agency's regulatory flexibility agenda, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, because they are likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities; and (2) Any rules that the Agency has identified for periodic review under section 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Printing of these entries is limited to fields that contain information required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act's agenda requirements. Additional information on these entries is in the Unified Agenda available online.
