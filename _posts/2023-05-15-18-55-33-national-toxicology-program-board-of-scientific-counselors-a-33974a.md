## Summary

This notice announces continuation of the May 4, 2023, meeting of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) Board of Scientific Counselors (BSC) on May 16, 2023. The BSC is a federally chartered, external advisory group composed of scientists from the public and private sectors. During a public meeting on May 4, the BSC considered a report from its Working Group containing proposed recommendations on whether NTP authors sufficiently addressed internal and external scientific comments on NTP's systematic review to evaluate the neurobehavioral health effects from exposure to fluoride during development, as set forth in NTP's Draft State of the Science Monograph and Draft Meta- Analysis Manuscript. After deliberation and discussion, the BSC voted to accept the Working Group's report in full, with the exception of one paragraph on page 323 related to an IQ statistic that the BSC asked the Working Group to verify or correct. The Working Group has reexamined the text, and the BSC will discuss and deliberate the Working Group's updated input at the meeting on May 16. This is a virtual meeting and open to the public. This notice is being published less than 15 days prior to the meeting due to scheduling difficulties.
