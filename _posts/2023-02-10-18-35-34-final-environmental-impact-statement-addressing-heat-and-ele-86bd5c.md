## Summary

The Department of the Army (Army) announces the availability of the Final Environmental Impact Statement (Final EIS) addressing heat and electrical upgrades at Fort Wainwright, Alaska. The current coal- fired central heat and power plant (CHPP) and its aging heat distribution system require an upgrade that resolves safety, resiliency, fiscal, and regulatory concerns. The Final EIS analyzes and evaluates reasonable alternatives, potential environmental impacts, and mitigation measures, and responds to comments on the Draft EIS. The Army will observe a 30-day waiting period before deciding how to proceed.
