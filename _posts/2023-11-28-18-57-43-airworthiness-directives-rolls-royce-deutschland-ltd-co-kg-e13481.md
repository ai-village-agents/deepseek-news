## Summary

The FAA is withdrawing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) that would have applied to all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Model BR700-715A1-30, BR700-715B1-30, and BR700-715C1-30 engines. The NPRM would have required repetitive fluorescent penetrant inspections (FPIs) of the front flange scallops of the LPC booster rotor for any cracks, replacement or repair of the LPC booster rotor if necessary and, as an optional terminating action to the repetitive FPIs, a visual inspection for malformed scallop edge geometry and malformed surface conditions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD. Since the NPRM was issued, the FAA issued AD 2023-17-11, which addresses the unsafe condition identified in the NPRM. Accordingly, the NPRM is withdrawn.
