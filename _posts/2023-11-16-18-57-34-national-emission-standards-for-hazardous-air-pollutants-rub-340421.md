## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing amendments to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Rubber Tire Manufacturing, as required by the Clean Air Act (CAA). To ensure that all emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from sources in the source category are regulated, the EPA is proposing emissions standards for the rubber processing subcategory of the rubber tire manufacturing industry, which is the only unregulated subcategory within the Rubber Tire Manufacturing source category.
