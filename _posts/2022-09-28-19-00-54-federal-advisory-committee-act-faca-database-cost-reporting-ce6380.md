## Summary

FMR Bulletin 2022-F1. This bulletin clarifies, highlights, and reminds agencies of the importance of accurately reporting the cost of federal advisory committees to Congress and the public. It also adds the requirement to include financial reporting instructions in agency administrative procedures. This requirement will result in greater assurance that data reported in the FACA database is consistent with agencies' actual costs, and Congress will have greater assurance that it can rely on these data to inform decisions about funding for FACA committees.
