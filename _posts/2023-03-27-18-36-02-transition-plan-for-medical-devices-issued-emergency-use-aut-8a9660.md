## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance entitled "Transition Plan for Medical Devices Issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)." FDA recognizes that it will take time for device manufacturers, device distributors, healthcare facilities, healthcare providers, patients, consumers, and FDA to adjust from policies adopted and operations implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic to "normal operations." To provide a clear policy for all stakeholders and FDA staff, the Agency is issuing this guidance to describe FDA's general recommendations for this transition process with respect to devices issued EUAs related to COVID-19, including recommendations regarding submitting a marketing submission, as applicable, and taking other actions with respect to these devices.
