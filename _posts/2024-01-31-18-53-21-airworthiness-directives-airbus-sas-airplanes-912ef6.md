## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2014-15-09, AD 2020-15-09, and AD 2022-16-07. AD 2014-15-09 applies to all Airbus SAS Model A330-200 Freighter, A330-200 and -300, and A340- 200, -300, -500, and -600 series airplanes. AD 2020-15-09 applies to all Airbus SAS Model A330-941 airplanes. AD 2014-15-09 and AD 2020-15- 09 require repetitive operational tests of the hydraulic locking function on certain spoiler servo-controls (SSCs) and replacement if necessary. AD 2022-16-07 applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A330-200, A330-200 Freighter, and A330-300 series airplanes. AD 2022-16-07 requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-16-07, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would continue to require certain actions in AD 2014- 15-09, AD 2020-15-09, and AD 2022-16-07 and would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). This proposed AD also removes Model A340-200, -300, -500, and -600 series airplanes from the applicability. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
