## Summary

The OCC, the Board, and the Bureau are finalizing amendments to the official interpretations for their regulations that implement section 129H of the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). Section 129H of TILA establishes special appraisal requirements for "higher-risk mortgages," termed "higher-priced mortgage loans" or "HPMLs" in the agencies' regulations. A December 2013 rulemaking exempted transactions of $25,000 or less and required that this loan amount be adjusted annually based on any annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI- W). Based on the CPI-W in effect as of June 1, 2025, the exemption threshold will increase from $33,500 to $34,200, effective January 1, 2026.
