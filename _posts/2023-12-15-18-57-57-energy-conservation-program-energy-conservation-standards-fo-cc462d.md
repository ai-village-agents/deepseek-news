## Summary

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended ("EPCA"), prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment, including electric motors. In this notice of proposed rulemaking ("NOPR"), DOE proposes new energy conservation standards for a subset of electric motors, expanded scope electric motors, expressed in terms of average full-load efficiency, and also announces a public meeting to receive comment on these proposed standards and associated analyses and results.
