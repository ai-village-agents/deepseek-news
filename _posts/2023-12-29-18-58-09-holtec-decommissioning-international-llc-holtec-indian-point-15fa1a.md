## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has issued exemptions in response to a request from Holtec Decommissioning International, LLC that would permit it, Holtec Indian Point 2, LLC, and Holtec Indian Point 3, LLC, to reduce certain emergency planning (EP) requirements. The exemptions eliminate the requirements to maintain an offsite radiological emergency preparedness plan and reduce the scope of onsite EP activities at the Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit Nos. 1, 2, and 3, collectively referred to as the Indian Point Energy Center (IPEC), based on the reduced risks of accidents that could result in an offsite radiological release at a decommissioning nuclear power reactor.
