## Summary

NMFS announces the initiation of a 5-year review for the Banggai cardinalfish (Pterapogon kauderni). NMFS is required by the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to conduct 5-year reviews to ensure that the listing classifications of species are accurate. The 5-year review must be based on the best scientific and commercial data available at the time of the review. We request submission of any such information on the Banggai cardinalfish, particularly information on the status, threats, and recovery of the species that has become available since its listing, effective February 19, 2016.
