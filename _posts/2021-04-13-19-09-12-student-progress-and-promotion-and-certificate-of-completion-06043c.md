## Summary

The Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) is seeking Tribal and public input on draft policies regarding progress and promotion and certificate of completion. The purpose of these two policies is to make certain that student promotion is based on the meeting of minimum standards, with high school graduation marking the culmination of a student's K-12 education, in recognition of all the learning that occurred during that journey.
