## Summary

In accordance with the requirement of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 which provides opportunity for public comment on new or revised data collections, the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) will publish periodic summaries of proposed data collections. Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the proposed information collection is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the RRB's estimate of the burden of the collection of the information; (c) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden related to the collection of information on respondents, including the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology. 1. Title and purpose of information collection: Employer Reporting; 3220-0005. Under Section 9 of the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) (45 U.S.C. 231h), and Section 6 of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA) (45 U.S.C. 356), railroad employers are required to submit reports of employee service and compensation to the RRB as needed for administering the RRA and RUIA. To pay benefits due on a deceased employee's earnings records or determine entitlement to, and amount of annuity applied for, it is necessary at times to obtain from railroad employers current (lag) service and compensation not yet reported to the RRB through the annual reporting process. The reporting requirements are specified in 20 CFR 209.6 and 209.7. The RRB currently utilizes the following forms to collect information to obtain the required lag service and related information from railroad employers: Form AA-12, Notice of Death and Request for Service Needed for Eligibility, Form G-88A.1 (or its internet equivalent, Form G-88A.1 (internet)), Request for Verification of Date Last Worked, and Form G-88A.2 (or its internet equivalent, Form G-88A.2 (internet)), Notice of Retirement and Request for Service Needed for Eligibility. Form AA-12 obtains a report of lag service and compensation from the last railroad employer of a deceased employee. This report covers the lag period between the date of the latest record of employment processed by the RRB and the date an employee last worked, the date of death or the date the employee may have been entitled to benefits under the Social Security Act. The information is used by the RRB to determine benefits due on the deceased employee's earnings record. Form G-88A.1 is sent by the RRB via a computer- generated listing or transmitted electronically via the RRB's Employer Reporting System (ERS) to employers. ERS consists of a series of screens with completion instructions and collects essentially the same information as the approved manual version. Form G-88A.1 is used for the specific purpose of verifying information previously provided to the RRB regarding the date last worked by an employee. If the information is correct, the employer need not reply. If the information is incorrect, the employer is asked to provide corrected information. Form G-88A.2 is used by the RRB to secure lag service and compensation information when it is needed to determine benefit eligibility. The RRB proposes no changes to Forms AA-12, G-88A.1 (internet), G-88A.2 (internet), G-88A.1 and G-88A.2. In addition, 20 CFR 209.12(b) requires all railroad employers to furnish the RRB with the home addresses of all employees hired within the last year (new hires). Form BA-6a, Form BA-6 Address Report (or its internet equivalent, Form BA-6a (internet)) is used by the RRB to obtain home address information of employees from railroad employers who do not have the home address information computerized and who submit the information in a paper format. The form also serves as an instruction sheet to railroad employers who submit the information electronically by CD-ROM. Completion of the forms is mandatory. Multiple responses may be filed by respondent. The RRB proposes no changes to Form BA-6a (internet), BA-6a, or BA-6a (Email).
