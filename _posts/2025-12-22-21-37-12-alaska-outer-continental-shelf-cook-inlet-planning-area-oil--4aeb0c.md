## Summary

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) announces the availability of the modified record of decision (ROD) for the Cook Inlet Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Lease Sale 258. The ROD identifies the selected alternative for Lease Sale 258, which was analyzed in the "Alaska Outer Continental Shelf, Cook Inlet Planning Area, Oil and Gas Lease Sale 258 in the Cook Inlet, Alaska, Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement" (OCS EIS/EA BOEM 2025- 035) (EIS). BOEM prepared the supplemental EIS to address deficiencies identified by the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska (Court) in its opinion of July 16, 2024, and to inform the decision maker on whether to affirm, modify, or void Lease Sale 258. In making her decision, the Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management (ASLM) considered nine alternatives, several sub-alternatives, and their potential impacts in the supplemental EIS. After careful consideration, the ASLM selected alternative 6, described in the supplemental EIS as the preferred alternative, which affirmed Lease Sale 258 as it was held in 2022 and the one lease issued from that lease sale.
