## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its spent fuel storage regulations by revising the NAC Multi- Purpose Canister (NAC-MPC) System listing within the "List of approved spent fuel storage casks" to renew, for 40 years, the initial certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 through 8 of Certificate of Compliance No. 1025. The renewal of the initial certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 through 8 would revise the certificate of compliance's conditions and technical specifications to address aging management activities related to the structures, systems, and components important to safety of the dry storage system to ensure that these will maintain their intended functions during the period of extended storage operations.
