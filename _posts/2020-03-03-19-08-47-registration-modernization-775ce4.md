## Summary

In conjunction with the development of new technological infrastructure for the copyright registration system, on October 17, 2018, the U.S. Copyright Office solicited public input regarding potential regulatory and practice updates to improve the system's efficiency for both users and the Office. The Office sought and received public comment on three main areas of proposed reform: The administration and substance of the application for registration, the utility of the public record, and the deposit requirements for registration. After reviewing the comments, the Office is announcing intended practice updates, to be adopted in conjunction with the deployment of the new technological system that the Library of Congress is building for the Office. The Office also seeks further comment on two proposals to permit post-registration edits to rights and permissions information, and to permit voluntary submission of additional deposit information to be included in the public record.
