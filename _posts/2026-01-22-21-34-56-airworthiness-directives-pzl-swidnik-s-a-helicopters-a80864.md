## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain PZL-Swidnik S.A. (Swidnik) Model PZL W-3A helicopters. This AD was prompted by the detection of corrosion on the main rotor blade (MRB) attachment bolts. This AD requires repetitively inspecting the MRB attachment bolts and, depending on the results of the inspection, repairing or replacing any affected bolts. This AD also requires reporting the inspection results and prohibits installing any MRB attachment bolt unless certain requirements are met. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
