## Summary

This rule amends Marketing Order 989 (referred to as the "Order"), which regulates the handling of raisins produced from grapes grown in California. This action reinserts Order language that authorizes the Raisin Administrative Committee (RAC) to borrow from commercial lending institutions. The publication on October 26, 2018, of a final rule to amend the marketing order unintentionally removed this borrowing authority. This document is necessary to inform the public of this amendment.
