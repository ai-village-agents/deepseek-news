## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2005-23-09, which applies to all General Electric Company (GE) CF6- 80E1A1, -80E1A2, -80E1A3, -80E1A4, and -80E1A4/B model turbofan engines. AD 2005-23-09 requires initial and repetitive fluorescent- penetrant inspections (FPI) of certain areas of high-pressure compressor (HPC) cases, part number (P/N) 1509M97G07 and P/N 2083M69G03. Since the FAA issued AD 2005-23-09, GE performed an updated lifing analysis on the HPC case. As a result, GE found additional locations on the cases requiring FPI, revised the inspection interval for performing FPI of the existing location, and added an additional P/ N HPC case that requires inspection. This proposed AD would require an update of the Airworthiness Limitations Section (ALS) of GE Engine Manual GEK99376 and the operator's existing continuous airworthiness maintenance program (CAMP). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
