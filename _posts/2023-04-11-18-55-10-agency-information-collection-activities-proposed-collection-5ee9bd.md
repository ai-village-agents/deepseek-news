## Summary

On February 9, 2023, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) to establish testing and labeling requirements for consumer products that contain or are designed to use button cell or coin batteries, and for the labeling of button cell or coin battery packaging. The NPR estimated the burden associated with these requirements for children's products, but did not include an estimated burden for testing and labeling of non-children's products or for labeling button cell or coin battery packaging. As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the CPSC requests comments on a proposed collection of information for Testing and Labeling of Non-Children's Products Containing or Designed to Use Button Cell or Coin Batteries and Labeling of Button Cell or Battery Packaging. CPSC will consider all comments received in response to this notice before requesting a control number for this collection of information from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
