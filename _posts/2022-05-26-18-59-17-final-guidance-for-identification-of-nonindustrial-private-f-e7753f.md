## Summary

On December 17, 2020, NRCS published a notice of proposed guidance for NIPF identification and provided a 30-day public comment period for input. NRCS received 139 comments from different members of the public, including Indian Tribes, State agencies, non-governmental organizations, and individuals. Several of these comments provided coordinated input from many organizations, including one letter that provided input from over 60 organizations. This document responds to comments received during the public comment period, which closed on January 19, 2021, and, for the reasons stated in this document, identifies that NRCS will not adopt the guidance it proposed in its December 2020 notice.
