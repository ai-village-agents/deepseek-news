## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve two state implementation plan (SIP) submissions under the Clean Air Act (CAA) that address the contingency measures requirements for the 1997 annual, 2006 24-hour, and 2012 annual fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or "standards") for the San Joaquin Valley PM<INF>2.5</INF> nonattainment area. The two SIP submissions include the area's contingency measure plan element and two specific contingency measures that would apply to residential wood burning heaters and fireplaces and non-agricultural, rural open areas. A third contingency measure, applicable to light-duty on-road motor vehicles, is the subject of a separate action by the EPA, but the related emissions reductions from the third measure are accounted for in this proposed rule. The EPA is proposing approval of the SIP submissions because the Agency has determined that they are in accordance with the applicable requirements for such SIP submissions under the CAA and EPA implementation regulations for the PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS. The proposed approval, if finalized, would incorporate the two contingency measures into the federally enforceable SIP. The EPA will accept comments on this proposed rule during a 30-day public comment period.
