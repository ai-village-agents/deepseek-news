## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH Model BO-105A, BO-105C, BO-105S, and BO-105LS A-3 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by the FAA's determination that aging of the elastomeric material in a tension torsion strap (TT-strap) could affect the structural characteristics of the TT-strap. This proposed AD would require replacement of certain TT-straps with serviceable parts and implementation of a new storage life limit for TT-straps, as specified in a European Aviation Safety Agency (now European Union Aviation Safety Agency) (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
