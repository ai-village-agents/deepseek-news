## Summary

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is issuing this notice to advise federal, state, and local government agencies and the public that USACE is withdrawing the notice of intent (NOI) for the preparation of a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) for the San Clemente Shoreline Protection Project (Project) which was published in the Federal Register on July 2, 2024. Since publication of the NOI, there has been a reduction in scope which involves less impacts than was anticipated at the time of the NOI, resulting in preparing a supplemental environmental assessment (SEA).
