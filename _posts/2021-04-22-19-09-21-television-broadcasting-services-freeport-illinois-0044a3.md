## Summary

The Commission has before it a petition for rulemaking filed by Gray Television Licensee, LLC (Petitioner), requesting the allotment of channel 9 at Freeport, Illinois. The current version of the DTV Table, which reflects the pre-incentive auction allotments, allocates DTV Channel 41 to Freeport, Illinois, but the licensee submitted a winning bid to go off air in the broadcast television incentive auction and subsequently suspended operations. Thus, Petitioner is requesting the allotment of channel 9 at Freeport as that community's first local service in the DTV Table of Allotments, which will be amended later to reflect all the incentive auction channel assignments.
