## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or "Agency") is seeking public nominations of scientific and technical experts that EPA can consider for service as ad hoc reviewers assisting the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act Scientific Advisory Panel (FIFRA SAP) for the review of design considerations for genetically engineered (GE) mosquitoes for mosquito control and for the review of information on the absence of novel proteins in the saliva of GE female mosquitoes. EPA currently anticipates selecting approximately 6-9 ad hoc reviewers and plans to make the list of candidates under consideration as prospective ad hoc reviewers for this review available for public comment. EPA is also announcing that a virtual public meeting of the FIFRA SAP is scheduled for November 3-5, 2025. In late August 2025, EPA plans to release the white paper to the FIFRA SAP for peer review, along with all background documents, related supporting materials, and charge questions provided to the FIFRA SAP. At that time, EPA will publish a separate document in the Federal Register to announce the availability of and solicit public comment on the draft documents and provide instructions for submitting comments and registering to provide oral comments at the November 3-5, 2025, meeting.
