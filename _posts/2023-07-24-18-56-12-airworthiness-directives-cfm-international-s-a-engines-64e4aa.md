## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all CFM International, S.A. (CFM) Model LEAP-1B21, LEAP-1B23, LEAP- 1B25, LEAP-1B27, LEAP-1B28, LEAP-1B28B1, LEAP-1B28B2, LEAP-1B28B2C, LEAP-1B28B3, LEAP-1B28BBJ1, and LEAP-1B28BBJ2 (LEAP-1B) engines. This proposed AD was prompted by a manufacturer investigation that revealed that certain high-pressure turbine (HPT) rotor stage 1 disks (HPT stage 1 disks) and a certain compressor rotor stages 6-10 spool were manufactured from material suspected to have reduced material properties due to iron inclusion. This proposed AD would require replacement of certain HPT stage 1 disks and a certain compressor rotor stages 6-10 spool. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
