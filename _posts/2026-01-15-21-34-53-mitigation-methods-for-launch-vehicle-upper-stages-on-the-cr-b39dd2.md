## Summary

This document informs the public that FAA has determined not to pursue the previously published NPRM, which proposed to require that upper stages of commercial launch vehicles and other components resulting from launch or reentry be removed from orbit within 25 years after launch, either through atmospheric disposal or maneuver to an acceptable disposal orbit. FAA is withdrawing this action to further consider comments received.
