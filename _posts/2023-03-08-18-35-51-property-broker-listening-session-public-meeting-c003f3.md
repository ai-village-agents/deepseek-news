## Summary

FMCSA announces that it will host a listening session pertaining to property brokers. Specifically, the Agency would like to hear from members of the public on two matters relating to the regulation of property brokers: (1) a January 5, 2023 notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) proposing to regulate five separate areas of broker (and freight forwarder) financial responsibility: assets readily available; immediate suspension of broker/freight forwarder operating authority; surety or trust responsibilities in cases of broker/freight forwarder financial failure or insolvency; enforcement authority; and entities eligible to provide trust funds for form BMC-85 trust fund filings; and (2) the November 16, 2022, interim guidance regarding FMCSA's interpretation of the definitions of broker and bona fide agents as it relates to all brokers of transportation by motor vehicle. This FMCSA-hosted listening session will be open to all interested persons and will take place concurrently with the Mid America Trucking Show (MATS) in Louisville, KY. All comments will be transcribed and placed in the public dockets for both regulatory actions. Individuals with diverse experiences and perspectives are encouraged to attend.
