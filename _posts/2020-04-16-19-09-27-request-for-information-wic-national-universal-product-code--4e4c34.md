## Summary

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC Program or WIC) is issuing this Request for Information to obtain input from WIC State agencies, authorized vendors, food manufacturers, technology partners, and other interested stakeholders regarding the direction of the National Universal Product Code (NUPC) database. The NUPC database can be used by WIC State agencies delivering benefits via Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) to develop, update and maintain their Authorized Product Lists (APLs). FNS is specifically interested in obtaining stakeholder perspectives on the role of the NUPC database to the program community, and different options for operating, maintaining, and/or enhancing the database. FNS welcomes comments from all interested stakeholders. As a background, on January 30, 2020, FNS issued the initial Request for Information, beginning a 60-day public comment period. Public involvement opportunities including public meetings, are now being modified based on considerations for employee and public health and safety. We recognize that there is a need to reopen the comment period to accommodate meaningful public involvement. FNS is reopening the comment period to provide additional time for interested parties to review this Request for Information.
