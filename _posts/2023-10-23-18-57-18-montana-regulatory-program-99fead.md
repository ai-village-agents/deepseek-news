## Summary

We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), are announcing receipt of a proposed amendment to the Montana regulatory program (hereinafter, the Montana program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). Montana submitted this proposed amendment to us, on its own initiative, following the passage of a Montana House Bill during the 2023 legislative session. Montana proposes several changes to the Montana Code Annotated (MCA). Montana adds a new section detailing the procedures a permittee must follow when applying for a "minor revision" to its permit. Montana adds several new definitions and removes the current procedures for a permit revision application. Furthermore, Montana adds clarifying language regarding "minor revisions" of permits. Lastly, Montana adds contingencies that will not be codified into law but that will apply to the proposed amendment: "Codification Instructions" and "Contingent Termination." This document gives the times and locations that the Montana program and this proposed amendment to that program are available for your inspection, the comment period during which you may submit written comments on the amendment, and the procedures that we will follow for the public hearing, if one is requested.
