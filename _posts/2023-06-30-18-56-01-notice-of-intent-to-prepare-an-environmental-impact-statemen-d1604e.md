## Summary

Consistent with the regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), BOEM announces its intent to prepare an EIS for a construction and operations plan (COP) submitted by Beacon Wind LLC (Beacon Wind). This NOI initiates the public scoping and comment process under NEPA and also seeks public comments under section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and its implementing regulations. Beacon Wind proposes to construct and operate an offshore wind facility located in Renewable Energy Lease Area OCS-A 0520 (Lease Area), which is approximately 128,811 acres and 17 nautical miles (nm) south of Nantucket, Massachusetts, and 52 nm east of Montauk, New York. Beacon Wind, a joint venture owned by Equinor U.S. Holdings, Inc. and BP Wind Energy North America, Inc., proposes to develop the entire Lease Area in two wind farms, known as Beacon Wind 1 (BW1) and Beacon Wind 2 (BW2) (collectively, the Project).
