## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for certain navigable waters of Great Egg Harbor Bay in Ocean City, NJ. The safety zone is needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards created by a barge-based fireworks display. Entry of vessels or persons into this zone is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port (COTP) Delaware Bay. Vessels within the zone prior to the enforcement period must leave the zone before the enforcement period begins. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
