## Summary

This proposed rule would amend the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards (the Construction and Safety Standards) by adopting recommendations made to HUD by the Manufactured Housing Consensus Committee (MHCC). The National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 (the Act) requires HUD to publish in the Federal Register any proposed revised Construction and Safety Standard submitted by the MHCC. The MHCC has prepared and submitted to HUD its third group of recommendations to improve various aspects of the Construction and Safety Standards. HUD has reviewed those proposals and has made editorial revisions to several and HUD proposes correlating additions for several of the proposals. HUD has decided not to go forward in this proposed rule with certain revisions recommended by the MHCC due to pending regulations for improving energy efficiency in manufactured homes currently being prepared by the Department of Energy. In addition, HUD has decided not to move forward with a new proposal to add requirements for draftstopping to the Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards. As agreed, these recommendations are being published to provide notice of the proposed revisions and an opportunity for public comment.
