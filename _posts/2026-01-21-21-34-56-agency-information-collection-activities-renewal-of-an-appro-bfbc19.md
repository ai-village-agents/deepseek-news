## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FMCSA announces its plan to submit the Information Collection Request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval and invites public comment. FMCSA requests approval to renew an ICR titled, "Marking of Self-Propelled CMVs and Intermodal Equipment." The renewal of this ICR will enable FMCSA to continue documenting the burden associated with the commercial motor vehicle (CMV) marking regulations. These regulations require marking of self- propelled CMVs and intermodal equipment by motor carriers, freight forwarders, and intermodal equipment providers (IEPs) engaging in interstate transportation and motor carriers that transport hazardous materials (HM) in intrastate transportation subject to the Hazardous Materials Safety Permit (HMSP) rules.
