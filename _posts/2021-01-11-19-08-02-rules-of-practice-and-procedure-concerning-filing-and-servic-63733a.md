## Summary

The Department of Labor (Department or DOL) is issuing this Direct Final Rule to require electronic filing (e-filing) and make acceptance of electronic service (e-service) automatic for attorneys and non-attorney representatives representing parties in proceedings before the Administrative Review Board (Board), unless the Board authorizes non-electronic filing and service for good cause. Self- represented persons will have the option of e-filing or of filing papers by conventional means. This rule establishes a new part containing rules of practice and procedure for the Board and amends existing regulations concerning filing and service that apply where a governing statute or executive order does not establish contrary rules of filing and service. It also makes other minor corrections to update existing regulations.
