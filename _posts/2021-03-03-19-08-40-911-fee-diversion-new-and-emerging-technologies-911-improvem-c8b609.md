## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (the FCC or Commission) proposes rules to implement the Don't Break Up the T-Band Act of 2020, which is Section 902 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Division FF, Title IX (Section 902). Section 902 directs the Commission to issue final rules, not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of Section 902, designating the uses of 911 fees by states and taxing jurisdictions that constitute 911 fee diversion for purposes of certain sections of the United States Code, as amended by Section 902. The intended effect of this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) is to propose rules that implement Section 902 and help to identify those uses of 911 fees by states and other jurisdictions that support the provision of 911 services.
