## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-25-51, which applies to all Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and Model BD-500-1A11 airplanes. AD 2022-25-51 requires revising the Limitations section of the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to include a new warning and a new limitation. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-25-51, updated primary flight control computer (PFCC) software has been developed to address the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2022-25-51, require installing the updated PFCC software, which terminates the AFM revision, and remove airplanes from the applicability, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
