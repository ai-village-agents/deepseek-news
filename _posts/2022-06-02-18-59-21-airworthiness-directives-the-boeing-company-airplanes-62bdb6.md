## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 747-100, 747-100B, 747-100B SUD, 747- 200B, 747-200C, 747-200F, 747-300, 747SR, and 747SP series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by significant changes, including new or more restrictive requirements, made to the airworthiness limitations (AWLs) related to fuel tank ignition prevention. This proposed AD would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate the latest revision of the AWLs. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
