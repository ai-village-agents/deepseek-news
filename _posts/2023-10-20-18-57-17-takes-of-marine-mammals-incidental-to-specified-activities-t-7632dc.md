## Summary

In accordance with the regulations implementing the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), as amended, notification is hereby given that NMFS promulgates regulations to govern the incidental taking of marine mammals incidental to Revolution Wind, LLC's (Revolution Wind), a subsidiary wholly owned by Orsted Wind Power North America, LLC (Orsted), construction of the Revolution Wind Offshore Wind Energy Project (hereafter known as the "Project") in Federal and State waters offshore Rhode Island, specifically within the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) Commercial Lease of Submerged Lands for Renewable Energy Development on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lease Area OCS-A-0486 (Lease Area) and along two export cable routes to sea- to-shore transition points (collectively referred to as the "Project Area"), over the course of 5 years (November 20, 2023 through November 19, 2028). These regulations, which allow for the issuance of a Letter of Authorization (LOA) for the incidental take of marine mammals during construction-related activities within the Project Area during the effective dates of the regulations, prescribe the permissible methods of taking and other means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact on marine mammal species or stocks and their habitat, as well as requirements pertaining to the monitoring and reporting of such taking.
