## Summary

The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) proposes an exemption that would relieve Federal agencies from the requirement of taking into account the effects of their undertakings on historic properties that involve the installation of certain electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE). The proposed exemption would allow all Federal agencies to forego the historic preservation review process required for Federal undertakings and more quickly implement EVSE infrastructure for the Federal fleet. The public is invited to comment on the draft exemption before it is finalized and submitted for review and potential adoption by the ACHP.
