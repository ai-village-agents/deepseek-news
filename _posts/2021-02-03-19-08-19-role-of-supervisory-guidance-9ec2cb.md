## Summary

The NCUA Board is adopting a final rule that codifies the Interagency Statement Clarifying the Role of Supervisory Guidance, issued by the NCUA, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the Board), the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) (collectively, the agencies) on September 11, 2018 (2018 Statement). By codifying the 2018 Statement, with amendments, the final rule confirms that the NCUA will continue to follow and respect the limits of administrative law in carrying out their supervisory responsibilities. The 2018 Statement reiterated well-established law by stating that, unlike a law or regulation, supervisory guidance does not have the force and effect of law. As such, supervisory guidance does not create binding legal obligations for the public. Because it is incorporated into the final rule, the 2018 Statement, as amended, is binding on the NCUA. The final rule adopts the rule as proposed without change.
