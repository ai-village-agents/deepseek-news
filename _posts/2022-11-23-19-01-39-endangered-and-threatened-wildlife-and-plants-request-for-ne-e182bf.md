## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), notify the public that we are requesting new information to update the Species Status Assessment (SSA) for the North American Wolverine (Gulo gulo luscus) occurring in the contiguous United States to make a final determination whether to list this species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). As a result of court action, the wolverine is now proposed for listing as a threatened species under the Act. The Service is updating the 2018 SSA and will reevaluate whether the North American wolverine occurring in the contiguous United States is a distinct population segment and, if so, whether the distinct population segment meets the definition of an endangered or threatened species under the Act. We now request new information regarding the North American wolverine to inform our SSA update and reevaluation under the Act. As directed by the court, the Service is to make a final listing determination by the end of November 2023.
