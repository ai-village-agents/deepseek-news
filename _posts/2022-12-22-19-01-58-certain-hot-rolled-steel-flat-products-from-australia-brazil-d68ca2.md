## Summary

As a result of the determinations by the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) orders on certain hot- rolled steel flat products (hot-rolled steel) from Australia, Japan, the Republic of Korea (Korea), the Netherlands, the Republic of Turkey (Turkey), and the United Kingdom would likely lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping and material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation of the AD orders for these countries. Further, as a result of Commerce's and the ITC's determinations that the countervailing duty (CVD) order on hot- rolled steel from Korea would likely lead to continuation or recurrence of net countervailable subsidies and material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation CVD order for Korea. Finally, as a result of the ITC's determination that revocation of the AD and CVD orders on hot-rolled steel from Brazil is not likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is revoking the AD and CVD orders on hot-rolled steel from Brazil.
