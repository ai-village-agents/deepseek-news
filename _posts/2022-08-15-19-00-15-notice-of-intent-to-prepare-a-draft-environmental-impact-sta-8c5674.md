## Summary

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Detroit District, is reviewing an application pursuant to section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and section 404 of the Clean Water Act for a Department of the Army (DA) permit by Enbridge Energy, Limited Partnership (Enbridge) (File LRE-2010-00463-56-A19) to construct a tunnel (the Line 5 Tunnel Project) that would house a replacement segment of Enbridge's Line 5 pipeline crossing the Straits of Mackinac (Straits) in Lake Michigan. The primary Federal involvement associated with the proposed action is the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, and the construction of structures and/or work that may affect navigable waters. Federal authorizations for the proposed project would constitute a "major federal action." Based on the potential impacts of the proposed project, the USACE intends to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to render a final decision on the permit application. The USACE is also preparing an Ethnographic/ Traditional Cultural Landscape Study as part of the EIS and its responsibilities under section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.
