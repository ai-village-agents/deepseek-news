## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-05- 12, which applied to all Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation Model GVII- G500 and GVII-G600 airplanes. AD 2020-05-12 required revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to incorporate revised limitations and procedures. This AD was prompted by reports of two landing incidents in which the alpha limiter engaged in the landing flare in unstable air, resulting in high rate of descent landings and damage to the airplanes. This AD retains certain requirements, and also adds and replaces certain AFM sections with more restrictive limitations and procedures. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
