## Summary

The President issued Proclamation 10895, "Adjusting Imports of Aluminum into the United States" (Aluminum Presidential Proclamation), on February 10, 2025, imposing specified rates of duty on imports of aluminum. In Proclamation 10895, the President authorized and directed the Secretary of Commerce to publish modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) so that it conforms to the amendments and effective dates in the proclamation. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) published the notice, Implementation of Duties on Aluminum Pursuant to Proclamation 10895 Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States, on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce on March 5, 2025, that fulfilled this directive. The revised HTSUS was set out in Annex 1 to the March 5 notice. BIS, in this notice, revises Annex 1 to add two additional aluminum derivative products: beer and empty aluminum cans.
