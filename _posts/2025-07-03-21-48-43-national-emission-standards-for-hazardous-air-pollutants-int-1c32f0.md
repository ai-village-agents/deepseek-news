## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking interim final action on the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Integrated Iron and Steel Manufacturing Facilities to revise certain compliance deadlines for standards finalized in 2024. Specifically, the EPA is revising certain compliance deadlines in the 2024 rule to April 3, 2027, in light of serious concerns that facilities will be unable to comply with the relevant requirements by the existing deadlines.
