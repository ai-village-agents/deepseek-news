## Summary

This action amends Class D airspace, Class E surface airspace, Class E airspace designated as an extension to a Class D surface area, and Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Athens/Ben Epps Airport, Athens, GA as a result of the biennial airspace evaluation. This action eliminates the excess airspace remaining after the decommissioning of the Bulldog Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) and subsequent cancellation of the NDB Runway 27 approach to Athens/Ben Epps Airport effective October 15, 2015, and updates the geographic coordinates for the airport and the Point of Origin. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.
