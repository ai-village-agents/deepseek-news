## Summary

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is issuing the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Policy. This policy describes a new hazard mitigation grant program to assist States, territories, Tribes, and local governments with mitigating the impacts of natural hazards, including those created, aggravated, or amplified by climate change. The new program is funded by a FEMA 6 percent set aside of estimated disaster expenses for each major disaster, supersedes the Pre-Disaster Mitigation grant program, and promotes a national culture of preparedness through encouraging investments to protect communities and infrastructure by increasing pre-disaster hazard mitigation and strengthening national resilience.
