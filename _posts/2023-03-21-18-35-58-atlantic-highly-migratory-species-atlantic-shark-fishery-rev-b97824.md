## Summary

NMFS announces the availability of the final SHARE document. As part of the overall review of the current state of the Atlantic shark fishery, NMFS examined various aspects of commercial and recreational shark fisheries conservation and management, shark depredation, and additional factors affecting the shark fishery. As a comprehensive review of the shark fishery, the SHARE document identifies areas of success and concerns in the fishery and identifies potential future revisions to regulations and management measures. NMFS anticipates that any such revisions to the regulations and/or management measures would occur via future rulemaking, as applicable, and would include appropriate opportunity for public comment.
