## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve revisions to the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) and the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (VCAPCD) portions of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the use and application of industrial adhesives. We are approving local rules that regulate these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act).
