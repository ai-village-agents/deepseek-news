## Summary

FMCSA announces that it has received an application from Waymo LLC, and Aurora Operations, Inc. (Waymo/Aurora) for a 5-year exemption from the required placement of warning devices around stopped commercial motor vehicles (CMVs); the requirement that lamps for warning devices be steady-burning; and the utilization of a warning device for stopped vehicles not currently allowed by Agency rules. The exemption sought would allow Waymo and Aurora to operate CMVs operated by a Level 4 automated driving system (ADS) equipped with warning beacons mounted on the truck cab in lieu of traditional warning devices placed around a stopped autonomous CMV, as required by current regulations. FMCSA requests public comment on the applicant's request for exemption.
