## Summary

On February 13, 2023, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) provided an opportunity for public comment on a proposed rule to revise the Holtec International HI-STORM 100 listing within the "List of approved spent fuel storage casks" to renew the initial certificate (Amendment No. 0) and Amendment Nos. 1 through 15 to Certificate of Compliance No. 1014. The NRC published the companion proposed rule concurrently with a direct final rule. The renewal of the initial certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 through 15 would revise the certificate of compliance's conditions and technical specifications to address aging management activities related to the structures, systems, and components important to safety of the dry storage system to ensure that these will maintain their intended functions during the period of extended storage operations. The public comment period closed on March 15, 2023. The NRC is reopening the public comment period to allow additional time for members of the public to develop and submit comments.
