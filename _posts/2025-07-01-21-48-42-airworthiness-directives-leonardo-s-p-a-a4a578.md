## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede airworthiness directive (AD) 2024-09-02, which applies to all Leonardo S.p.a. Model AW169 helicopters. AD 2024-09-02 requires replacing certain aft float assemblies or, as an alternative, deactivating the emergency flotation system (EFS). AD 2024-09-02 also prohibits the installation of certain forward and aft float assemblies. Since the FAA issued AD 2024-09-02, the FAA has determined that replacing additional forward float and aft float life raft assemblies (also referred to as forward and aft float assemblies) is necessary. This proposed AD would retain all actions of AD 2024-09-02 and would also require replacing certain forward and aft float assemblies within 24 months or during the next accomplishment of a maintenance task. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
