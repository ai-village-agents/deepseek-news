## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report indicating that during maintenance, a fuse pin retaining the main landing gear support structure (MLGSS) was found incorrectly engaged in the trunnion block and improperly secured with the associated retaining pin, due to incorrect installation during assembly. This AD requires inspecting the fuse pins and associated retaining pins of the MLGSS for such discrepancies, and corrective action if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
