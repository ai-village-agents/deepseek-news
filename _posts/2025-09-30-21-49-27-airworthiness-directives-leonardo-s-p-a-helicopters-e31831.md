## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-23-04 which applies to certain Leonardo S.p.A. Model A109E helicopters. AD 2021-23-04 requires repetitive inspections of the intersection of the lateral pylon and floor spar at station (STA) 1815 for cracking and repair, depending on the findings. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-23-04, it was determined that additional helicopter models are affected by the unsafe condition. Additionally, the manufacturer has developed a modification that provides terminating action for the repetitive inspections. This proposed AD would continue to require repetitive inspections of the affected area for cracking and would add additional helicopter models to the applicability. This proposed AD would also require modifying the affected area, which would be terminating action for the repetitive inspections. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
