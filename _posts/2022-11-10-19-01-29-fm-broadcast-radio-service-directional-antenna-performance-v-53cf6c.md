## Summary

In this document, the Commission announces that the Office of Management and Budget has approved revisions to the information collection requirements under OMB Control Numbers 3060-0506 and 3060- 0938, as associated with the amended rules adopted in the Federal Communications Commission's FM Broadcast Directional Antenna Performance Verification Order, FCC 22-38. This Order governs the Commission's revised FM broadcast rules to allow for FM antenna directional pattern verification by computer modeling, and the procedures for submitting the required modeling information on the appropriate FCC 2100, Schedule 302-FM (FM Station License Application) or FCC Form 2100, Schedule 319 (Low Power FM (LPFM) License Application). This document is consistent with the FM Broadcast Directional Antenna Performance Verification Order, which states that the Commission will publish a document in the Federal Register announcing the effective date for these amended rule sections and revise the rules accordingly.
