## Summary

The Department of Commerce (Commerce) is simultaneously initiating and issuing the preliminary results of the changed circumstances reviews of the antidumping and countervailing duty orders on oil country tubular goods (OCTG) from the People's Republic of China (China) to determine whether HLDS (B) Steel Sdn Bhd (HLDS (B)) and HLD Clark Steel Pipe Co., Inc. (HLD Clark) (collectively, HLD companies) are eligible to participate in a certification process because the HLD companies have preliminarily demonstrated that they can identify OCTG that they produced in either Brunei or the Philippines using non- Chinese hot-rolled steel. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.
