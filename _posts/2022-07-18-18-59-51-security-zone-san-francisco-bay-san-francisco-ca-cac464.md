## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a security zone in the navigable waters of the San Francisco Bay near Yerba Buena Island within the San Francisco Captain of the Port (COTP) zone. This security zone is necessary to provide for the security of military service members on board vessels moored at the pier and the government property associated with these valuable national assets. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit the entry of, transiting through, or anchoring within a portion of the San Francisco Bay extending from Yerba Buena Island unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port San Francisco. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
