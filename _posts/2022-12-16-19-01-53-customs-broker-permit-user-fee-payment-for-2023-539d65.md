## Summary

This document provides notice to customs brokers that the annual user fee that is assessed for each permit held by a broker, whether it may be an individual, partnership, association, or corporation, is due no later than February 24, 2023. The annual user fee reflects the changes made by two final rules, published in the Federal Register on October 18, 2022, and effective December 19, 2022, that eliminate broker districts and district permits, and transition all customs brokers to a single national permit. Pursuant to fee adjustments required by the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST ACT) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regulations, the annual user fee payable for calendar year 2023 will be $163.71.
