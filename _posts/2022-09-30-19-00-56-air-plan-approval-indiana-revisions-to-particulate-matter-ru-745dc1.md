## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the Indiana particulate matter State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the Vertellus Agriculture and Nutrition Specialties, LLC (Vertellus) facility located in Indianapolis, Marion County. Indiana submitted a request to revise its particulate matter SIP to incorporate site-specific updates to the particulate matter emission limits for Vertellus. The updates reflect revised emission rates for particulate matter resulting from process changes related to control strategies for other pollutants. The SIP submission requests also remove units no longer in operation as well as update language to reflect a switch from petroleum oil to natural gas for certain units. These site-specific SIP submissions represent a decrease in overall particulate matter emissions. Therefore, EPA is proposing to approve them as SIP-strengthening measures.
