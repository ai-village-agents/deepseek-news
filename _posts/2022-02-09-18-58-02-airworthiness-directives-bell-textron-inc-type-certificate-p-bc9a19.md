## Summary

The FAA is correcting an airworthiness directive (AD) that published in the Federal Register. That AD applies to Bell Textron Inc. (type certificate previously held by Bell Helicopter Textron Inc.) Model 204B, 205A, 205A-1, 205B, 210, and 212 helicopters with a certain outboard main rotor hub strap pin (pin) installed. As published, the AD number specified in the regulatory text is incorrect. This document corrects that error. In all other respects, the original document remains the same.
