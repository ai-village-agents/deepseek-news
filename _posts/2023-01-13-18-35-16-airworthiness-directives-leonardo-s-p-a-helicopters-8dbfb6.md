## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Leonardo S.p.a. Model A109, A109A, A109A II, A109C, A109E, A109K2, A109S, and AW109SP helicopters modified by Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) SR01812LA. This AD was prompted by a report of certain floats not deploying due to a faulty plunger assembly. This AD requires repairing or replacing certain float assemblies. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
