## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is initiating an effort to elicit information from stakeholders and the interested public concerning the prioritization of rulemakings pursuant to the Department's updated and modernized rulemaking methodology titled, "Procedures, Interpretations, and Policies for Consideration of New or Revised Energy Conservation Standards and Test Procedures for Consumer Products and Commercial/Industrial Equipment" (Process Rule). This rule expands early opportunities for public input on the Appliance Program's priority setting of its rulemaking activities. The Department notes that this notice represents DOE's inaugural effort to implement its revised priority-setting process. DOE welcomes written comments as well as the submission of data and other relevant information from the public relevant to priority setting for all DOE energy conservation standard and test procedure rulemakings.
