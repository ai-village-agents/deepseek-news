## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Comprehensive Evaluations of the Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention Programs (WISEWOMAN, National CVH Program, Innovative CVH Program). The purpose of the data collection is to evaluate the implementation of evidence-based strategies within these programs, measure their impact on cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention and management, and to identify strategies that are most effective in reaching populations disproportionately affected by CVD.
