## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Evaluation of an Online Prostate Cancer Decision Aid. This three-arm, randomized controlled trial (RCT) includes eight forms of data collection including surveys and interviews and will evaluate the impact of a virtual human decision aid to help improve the quality of prostate cancer screening and treatment decisions.
