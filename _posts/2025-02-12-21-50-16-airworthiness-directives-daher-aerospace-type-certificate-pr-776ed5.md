## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain DAHER AEROSPACE (DAHER) Model TBM 700 airplanes. This AD was prompted by certain existing emergency procedures in the pilot's operating handbook (POH) that cannot be fully accomplished since certain equipment cannot be disconnected by the pilot(s) from the flight deck. This AD requires revising the existing POH for your airplane to provide the flight crew with corrected emergency procedures. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
