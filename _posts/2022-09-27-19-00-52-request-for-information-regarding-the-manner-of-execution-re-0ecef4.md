## Summary

The Department of Justice is requesting information in the form of written comments that may include information, research, and data regarding 28 CFR part 26, which governs the implementation of federal executions. On November 27, 2020, the Department amended these regulations to expand the permissible methods of execution beyond lethal injection to "any other manner prescribed by the law of the State in which the sentence was imposed." The amendments also authorized the use of state facilities and personnel in federal executions and made a number of procedural changes, including granting the Attorney General authority to make exceptions to the regulations and to delegate duties within the Department.
