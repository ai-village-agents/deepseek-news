## Summary

The Department of Labor is extending the comment period for a proposed rule that would update the process for coal mine operators to apply for authorization to self-insure, the requirements operators must meet to qualify to self-insure, the amount of security self-insured operators must provide, and the process for operators to appeal determinations made by the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP). Since the proposed rule was published, the Department has received multiple requests from interested parties for the Department to provide additional time for them to develop and submit their comments on the proposal. In response to those requests, the Department is extending the comment period.
