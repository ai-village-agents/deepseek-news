## Summary

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) establishes the approximately 176-square mile "Tryon Foothills" American viticultural area (AVA) in Polk County, North Carolina. The Tryon Foothills AVA is not located within, nor does it contain, any other established viticultural area. TTB designates AVAs to allow vintners to better describe the origin of their wines and to allow consumers to better identify wines they may purchase.
