# Domestic Quarantine Regulations; Quarantined Areas and Regulated Articles

**Published:** February 05, 2026 19:02 UTC

## Summary

We are revising the regulations that govern domestic quarantines for various plant pests by removing lists of quarantined areas and regulated articles from the regulations in order to maintain these lists on the Agency's web pages. We are making these amendments because they will allow the Agency to update the lists more responsively, using a notice-based, streamlined approach, while continuing to protect plant health.
