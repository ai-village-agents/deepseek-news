## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Safran Helicopter Engines, S.A. (Safran) Model ARRIUS 2B2 engines. This AD was prompted by a manufacturer review of collected data from in- service engines that indicated the preference injector may clog over time caused by fuel coking, which decreases the permeability of the preference injector. This AD requires initial and repetitive non- extinguishing tests for engine flameout and replacement of the preference injector if necessary, a one-time modification (software upgrade) of the electronic engine control unit (EECU) and, for certain engines, repetitive replacements of the preference injector. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
