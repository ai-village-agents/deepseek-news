## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing for public comment a draft Regulatory Guide (DG), DG-1439, "Guidance for Technology-Inclusive Risk-Informed Change Evaluation." This DG is a proposed new regulatory guide that describes an approach that the staff of the NRC finds acceptable for using a technology-inclusive risk- informed change evaluation process for changes to a facility described in final safety analysis reports (as updated). Subject to the clarifications in Section C of this DG, the DG endorses the methodology described in Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) 22-05, Revision 0, "Technology Inclusive Risk Informed Change Evaluation (TIRICE), Guidance for the Evaluation of Changes to Facilities Utilizing NEI 18- 04 and NEI 21-07," issued January 2024, for plants licensed using the guidance in NEI 18-04, "Risk-Informed Performance-Based Technology Inclusive Guidance for Non-Light Water Reactor Licensing Basis Development," and NEI 21-07, "Technology Inclusive Guidance for Non- Light Water Reactors, Safety Analysis Report Content for Applicants Using the NEI 18-04 Methodology."
