## Summary

By decision served March 15, 2023 (Decision No. 35), the Board approved the acquisition of control by Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) of Kansas City Southern (KCS), resulting in the newly merged entity, Canadian Pacific Kansas City Limited (CPKC). As a condition of the Board's approval, the Board imposed a seven-year oversight period, during which the Board will closely monitor CPKC's compliance with, and the effectiveness of, the conditions imposed by the Board. Throughout the oversight period, CPKC is required to report numerous service, operational, and competition-related metrics at prescribed frequencies, as described in Decision No. 35, Appendix B, "Reporting & Recordkeeping Requirements." The Board is now instituting this proceeding to implement the general oversight condition and provides further guidance regarding CPKC's reporting and recordkeeping obligations.
