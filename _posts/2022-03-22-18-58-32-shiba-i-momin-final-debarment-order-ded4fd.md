## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) debarring Shiba I. Momin for a period of 5 years from importing or offering for import any drug into the United States. FDA bases this order on a finding that Ms. Momin was convicted of one felony count under Federal law for Conspiracy. The factual basis supporting Ms. Momin's conviction, as described below, is conduct relating to the importation into the United States of a drug or controlled substance. Ms. Momin was given notice of the proposed debarment and was given an opportunity to request a hearing to show why she should not be debarred. As of December 26, 2021 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Ms. Momin had not responded. Ms. Momin's failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of her right to a hearing concerning this matter.
