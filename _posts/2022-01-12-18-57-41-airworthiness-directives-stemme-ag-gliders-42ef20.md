## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Stemme AG Model Stemme S 10-VT and Stemme S 12 gliders. This AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as unintended slipping of the freewheel clutch with overheating (burnishing) of the friction pads inside of the clutch. This AD requires removing the affected freewheel clutch from service. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
