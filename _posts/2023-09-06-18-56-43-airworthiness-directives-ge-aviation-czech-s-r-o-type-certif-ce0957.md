## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-01-07, which applies to all GE Aviation Czech s.r.o. (GEAC) (type certificate previously held by WALTER Engines a.s., Walter a.s., and MOTORLET a.s.) Model H75-100, H75-200, H80, H80-100, H80-200, H85-100, and H85-200 engines. AD 2023-01-07 requires revising the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the existing engine maintenance manual (EMM) and the operator's existing approved maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate updated coefficients and recalculate the cycles accumulated on critical parts. Since the FAA issued AD 2023-01-07, the manufacturer revised the ALS of the EMM to introduce new and more restrictive airworthiness limitations and associated thresholds and intervals for life-limited parts, which prompted this proposed AD. This proposed AD would require revising the ALS of the existing EMM and the operator's existing approved engine maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new and more restrictive instructions and associated thresholds and intervals for life-limited parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
