## Summary

Pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Office of Housing, Single Family Operations Division is modifying a system of records titled "Distributive Shares and Refund Subsystem (DSRS)". The DSRS serves as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) repository for verifying mortgage insurance premium refunds and distributive share payments which are issued to eligible homeowners (mortgagors) who had an FHA mortgage insured loan. This system of records is being revised to make clarifying changes within: Authority for Maintenance of the System, System Location, Purpose of the System, Categories of Individuals Covered by the System, Categories of Records in the System, Records Source Category, Routine Uses of Records Maintained, Retention and Disposal of Records, Record Access Procedures, Contesting Record Procedures, and Notification Procedures. The modifications are outlined in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section.
