## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-19-08 and AD 2018-19-02, which applied to Airbus Defense and Space S.A. Model C-212-CB, C-212-CC, C-212-CD, C-212-CE, and C-212-DF airplanes. AD 2018-19-02 required repetitive inspections of the rudder pedal control system support box and shaft and applicable corrective actions; accomplishing those actions terminated the requirements of AD 2017-19- 08. This AD continues to require repetitive inspections and applicable corrective actions; and also requires a modification of the rudder pedal adjustment system; as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD was prompted by a determination that a modification must be done in order to address the unsafe condition. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
