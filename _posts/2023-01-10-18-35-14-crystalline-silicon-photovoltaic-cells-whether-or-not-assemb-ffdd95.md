## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily determines that countervailable subsidies were provided to producers and exporters of crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells, whether or not assembled into modules, (solar cells) from the People's Republic of China (China) during the period of review (POR), January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020. We are rescinding this review with respect to Canadian Solar (USA) Inc. Further, we intend to rescind this review with respect to 60 companies. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.
