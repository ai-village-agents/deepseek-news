## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a continuing information collection project titled List of Ingredients Added to Tobacco in the Manufacture of Cigarette Products. This data collection is developed so that cigarette manufacturers, packagers, and importers can submit annually to HHS (through CDC) a list of ingredients added to tobacco in the manufacturing of cigarettes.
