## Summary

NMFS has received a request from Revolution Wind, LLC (Revolution Wind), a 50/50 joint venture between [Oslash]rsted North America, Inc. ([Oslash]rsted) and Eversource Investment, LLC, for Incidental Take Regulations (ITR) and an associated Letter of Authorization (LOA). The requested regulations would govern the authorization of take, by Level A harassment and/or Level B harassment, of small numbers of marine mammals over the course of 5 years (2023- 2028) incidental to construction of the Revolution Wind Offshore Wind Farm Project offshore of Rhode Island in a designated lease area on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS-A-0486), within the Rhode Island- Massachusetts Wind Energy Area (RI/MA WEA). Project activities likely to result in incidental take include pile driving (impact and vibratory), potential unexploded ordnance (UXO/MEC) detonation, and vessel-based site assessment surveys using high-resolution geophysical (HRG) equipment. NMFS requests comments on its proposed rule. NMFS will consider public comments prior to making any final decision on the promulgation of the requested ITR and issuance of the LOA; agency responses to public comments will be summarized in the final notice of our decision. The proposed regulations would be effective October 5, 2023-October 4, 2028.
