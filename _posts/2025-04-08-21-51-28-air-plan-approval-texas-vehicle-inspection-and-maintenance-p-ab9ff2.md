## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving revisions to the Texas State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted to the EPA by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ or State) on December 18, 2023. The SIP revisions address Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles and establish a Motor Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) program for the San Antonio ozone nonattainment area. The revisions also update definitions and address options for displaying a vehicle's registration as proof of compliance with I/M requirements. Additionally, this final action terminates the EPA's requirement to promulgate a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for a Basic I/M program in the San Antonio nonattainment area.
