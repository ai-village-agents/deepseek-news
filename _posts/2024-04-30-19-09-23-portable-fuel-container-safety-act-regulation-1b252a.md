## Summary

In August 2023, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) accepted ASTM F3429/F3429M-23 for prefilled portable fuel containers as the mandatory standard under the Portable Fuel Container Safety Act of 2020 (PFCSA). In January 2024, ASTM notified the Commission that ASTM F3429/F3429M-23 had been revised. The Commission has evaluated revised ASTM F3429/F3429M-24 and finds that the revisions to the standard carry out the purposes of the PFCSA. Accordingly, ASTM F3429/F3429M-24 will be incorporated into the mandatory standard for portable fuel containers.
