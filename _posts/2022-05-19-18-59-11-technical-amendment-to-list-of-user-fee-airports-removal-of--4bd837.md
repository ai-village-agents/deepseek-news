## Summary

This document amends U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regulations by removing one airport from the list of user fee airports. User fee airports are airports that have been approved by the Commissioner of CBP to receive, for a fee, the customs services of CBP officers for processing aircraft, passengers, and cargo entering the United States, but do not qualify for designation as international or landing rights airports. Specifically, this technical amendment reflects the removal of the designation of user fee airport status for the Hillsboro Airport in Hillsboro, Oregon.
