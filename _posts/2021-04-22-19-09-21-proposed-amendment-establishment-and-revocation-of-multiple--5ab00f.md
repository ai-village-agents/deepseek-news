## Summary

This action proposes to amend Jet Route J-181 and VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-13, V-14, V-15, and V- 307; establish Area Navigation (RNAV) routes T-411 and T-413; and remove VOR Federal airway V-506. The FAA is proposing this action due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Neosho, MO (EOS), VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) navigation aid (NAVAID). The Neosho VOR is being decommissioned in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
