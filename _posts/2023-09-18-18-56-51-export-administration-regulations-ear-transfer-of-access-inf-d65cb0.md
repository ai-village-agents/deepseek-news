## Summary

In this final rule, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to make a technical correction that also serves to clarify provisions of the EAR pertaining to the release of "software" as set out in the sections on release and transfer of access information. This final rule clarifies an ambiguity in the EAR by adding a cross-reference addressing transfer of access information in the section on releases of "technology" and "software," as was originally intended. In addition, this final rule adds a clarifying note that, for purposes of transfer of access information, a release of "software" includes both source code and object code.
