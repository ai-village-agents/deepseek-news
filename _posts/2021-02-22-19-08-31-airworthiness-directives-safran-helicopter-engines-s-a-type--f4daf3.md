# Airworthiness Directives; Safran Helicopter Engines, S.A. (Type Certificate Previously Held by Turbomeca, S.A.) Turboshaft Engines

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Safran Helicopter Engines, S.A. (Safran Helicopter Engines) Arriel 2B, 2B1, 2C, 2C1, 2C2, 2S1 and 2S2 model turboshaft engines. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of non-conforming fuel filter pre-blockage pressure switches. This proposed AD would require repetitive visual inspections of the fuel filter by-pass indicator pop- up, a one-time operational test of the fuel filter pre-blockage pressure switch and, depending on the findings, replacement of the fuel filter pre-blockage pressure switch with a part eligible for installation. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
