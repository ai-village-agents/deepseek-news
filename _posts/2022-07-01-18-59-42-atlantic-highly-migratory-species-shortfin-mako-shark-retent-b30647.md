## Summary

In this final rule, NMFS is implementing a flexible shortfin mako shark retention limit with a default limit of zero in commercial and recreational Atlantic highly migratory species (HMS) fisheries. The default limit of zero will remain in place unless and until changed. Under this final rule, future changes to the retention limit can only be made based on consideration of regulatory criteria and only if consistent with an allowable retention determination made by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) pursuant to Recommendation 21-09. This action is necessary to implement the binding recommendations of ICCAT adopted in 2021, as authorized under the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (ATCA), and to achieve domestic management objectives under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act).
