## Summary

The rapidly emerging field of Quantum Information Science (QIS) has the potential to produce innovations in quantum computing, simulation, communication, sensing and other technologies which are critical to our nation's future economic and national security. As a new and strongly technology-oriented field, QIS requires a well-trained workforce to fill positions ranging from research and development to design and manufacturing. The Office of Science in the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) invites input from higher education institutions on approaches needed to prepare students for careers related to QIS, including identification of opportunities where DOE's network of national laboratories could assist in training the future scientific and technological QIS workforce. Higher education institutions, including public and private universities, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Serving Institutions, community colleges, and emerging research institutions (defined as "an institution of higher education with an established undergraduate or graduate program that has less than $50,000,000 in Federal research expenditures" [CHIPS and Science Act]), are especially encouraged to provide input.
