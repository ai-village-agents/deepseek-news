## Summary

In accordance with the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (NMSA) and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is initiating a scoping process to consider designating a national marine sanctuary in the Hudson Canyon area approximately 100 miles offshore southeast of New York City. NOAA is initiating this scoping process based on the area's diverse qualities, which are described in the Wildlife Conservation Society's (WCS's) November 2016 Hudson Canyon national marine sanctuary nomination. Specifically, WCS's nomination provides important context and background regarding the natural and cultural resources in the region, the potential benefits of national marine sanctuary designation, recommendations for management of the sanctuary, and a proposed sanctuary boundary, which NOAA will take under consideration, but does not represent an official boundary proposal at this time. As a first step in this scoping process, NOAA invites comments on the factors that will contribute to its determination of whether to designate the area as a national marine sanctuary; designation would include preparation and release of a draft environmental impact statement (including national marine sanctuary boundary alternatives), proposed regulations, and a draft management plan. This scoping process will also inform the initiation of any consultations with Federal, State, or local agencies, Tribes, and other interested parties, as appropriate. In support of the scoping process, the nomination package and additional information regarding the qualities of the Hudson Canyon area can be found at https://sanctuaries.cnoaa.gov/hudson-canyon/.
