## Summary

Pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, the Department of the Interior (DOI) is issuing a public notice of its intent to modify the Privacy Act system of records, INTERIOR/DOI-45, HSPD-12: Identity Management System and Personnel Security Files. DOI is revising this notice to update the title of the system, update all sections of the system notice, propose new and modified routine uses, and provide general administrative updates to the remaining sections of the notice. Additionally, DOI is publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) elsewhere in the Federal Register to exempt this system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act. This modified system will be included in DOI's inventory of record systems.
