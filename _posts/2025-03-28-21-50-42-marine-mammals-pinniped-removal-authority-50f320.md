## Summary

On August 21, 2024, NMFS received an application pursuant to section 120(f) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game, on behalf of their respective states; the Nez Perce Tribe, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon, the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation; and the Willamette Committee (hereafter "eligible entities"). In their application, the eligible entities requested that NMFS renew their August 14, 2020, MMPA section 120(f) permit (which expires on August 14, 2025) for an additional five years to intentionally take, by lethal methods, individually identifiable California sea lions (CSL) (Zalophus californianus) and Steller sea lions (SSL) (Eumetopias jubatus: Eastern stock) that are located in the main stem of the Columbia River between river mile 112 (I-205 bridge) and McNary Dam (river mile 292), or in any tributary to the Columbia River that includes spawning habitat of threatened or endangered salmon or steelhead (Onchorynchus spp.) (hereafter "geographic area"). The eligible entities seek no changes to the terms and conditions in the August 14, 2020, permit, other than to renew the existing permit for a five-year period that would begin on the date of issuance of the permit.
