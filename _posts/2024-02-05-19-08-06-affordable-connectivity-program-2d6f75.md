## Summary

In this document, due to a lack of additional funding from Congress, the Wireline Competition Bureau (Bureau) of the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) issued an Order laying out wind- down procedures for the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), important dates, and the impacts on consumers and providers. These procedures include the process for notifying enrolled ACP households about the impact of program termination on their broadband service and bills and the freezing of new enrollments. The Bureau also offers guidance to providers regarding advertising, awareness, and outreach requirements, timing of claims submissions, and participation during a possible partially funded month of ACP.
