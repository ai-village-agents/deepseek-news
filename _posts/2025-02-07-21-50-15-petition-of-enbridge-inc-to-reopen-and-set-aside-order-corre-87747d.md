## Summary

The Federal Trade Commission ("Commission") published a document in the Federal Register of January 30, 2025, announcing the Commission's receipt of a petition from Enbridge Inc. ("Enbridge" or "the company") to reopen and set aside the Commission's Decision and Order entered on March 22, 2017 (the "Order"), concerning ownership interests in competing natural gas pipelines. Shortly after publication, the Commission learned the document contained the incorrect deadline for receipt of public comments. The Commission issues this correction to reflect the corrected deadline. Comments must be received on or before February 21, 2025, not March 3, 2025.
