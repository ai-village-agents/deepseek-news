## Summary

NMFS issues regulations to implement Amendment 34 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Coastal Migratory Pelagic (CMP) Resources of the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Region (CMP FMP) (Amendment 34), as prepared and submitted by the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (South Atlantic Council) and the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Gulf Council). For Atlantic migratory group king mackerel (Atlantic king mackerel), this final rule revises the stock and sector annual catch limits (ACL), and the recreational bag and possession limits off the east coast of Florida. For both Atlantic king mackerel and Atlantic migratory group Spanish mackerel (Atlantic Spanish mackerel), this final rule revises the landing fish intact provisions for the recreational sector. In addition, for Atlantic king mackerel, Amendment 34 revises the acceptable biological catch (ABC) and annual optimum yield (OY). The purpose of this final rule and Amendment 34 is to revise the catch limits based on a recent stock assessment and the best scientific information available, and to revise management measures for Atlantic king and Spanish mackerel.
