# Guidelines for Evaluating Account and Services Requests

## Summary

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) is withdrawing proposed amendments to its Guidelines for Evaluating Account and Services Requests (Account Access Guidelines) that would have required the Federal Reserve Banks (Reserve Banks) to publish a periodic list of depository institutions with access to Reserve Bank accounts and/or financial services. Because a new section 11C of the Federal Reserve Act (the Act) was recently enacted that requires disclosures substantially similar to those in the Board's proposal, the Board believes finalizing the proposed amendments to its Account Access Guidelines is unnecessary. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
