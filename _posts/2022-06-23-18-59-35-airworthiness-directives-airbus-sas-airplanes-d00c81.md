## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2016-10-08, AD 2017-05-10, and AD 2019-01-05, which apply to certain Airbus SAS Model A330-200, -200 Freighter, and -300 series airplanes; and AD 2019-20-13, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A330-200, A330-200 Freighter, A330-300, A340-200, A340-300, A340-500, and A340- 600 series airplanes. AD 2016-10-08 requires determining the flight cycles accumulated on certain trimmable horizontal stabilizer actuators (THSAs), and replacing the THSA if necessary. AD 2017-05-10, AD 2019- 01-05, and AD 2019-20-13 require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable. Since the FAA issued those ADs, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate additional new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
