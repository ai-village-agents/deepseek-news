## Summary

The Department of Energy (DOE) has submitted an information collection request to the OMB for extension under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The information collection requests a three-year extension of its collection, titled U.S. Department of Energy Better Buildings Challenge, Better Buildings Alliance and the Better Buildings, Better Plants Voluntary Pledge Program, OMB Control Number 1910-5141. The proposed collection will allow DOE to operate voluntary programs intended to drive energy efficiency and emissions reductions within the marketplace. Questions will allow DOE to recognize program partners for their success, build web pages that educate the public on successful energy efficiency strategies, and draft publicly available progress reports.
