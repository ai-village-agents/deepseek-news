## Summary

The FAA has tentatively determined to extend through October 24, 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19)-related limited waiver of the minimum slot usage requirement at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), New York LaGuardia Airport (LGA), and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) that the FAA has already made available through May 31, 2020. Similarly, the FAA has tentatively determined to extend through October 24, 2020, its coronavirus-related policy for prioritizing flights canceled at designated International Air Transport Association (IATA) Level 2 airports in the United States, for purposes of establishing a carrier's operational baseline in the next corresponding season. These IATA Level 2 airports include Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD), Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), and San Francisco International Airport (SFO). These extensions through October 24, 2020, would be on the same terms as the relief that the FAA already has announced through May 31, 2020. This notice affords interested persons an opportunity to show cause why the FAA should or should not finalize this tentative decision to extend relief through October 24, 2020, and to submit any information relevant to making this decision. The FAA anticipates subsequently providing notice of its final decision.
