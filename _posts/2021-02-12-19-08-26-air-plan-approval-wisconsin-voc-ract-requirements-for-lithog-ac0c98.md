## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR or Wisconsin) on December 13, 2019. Wisconsin requests that EPA approve rules related to control of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from offset lithographic printing operations into Wisconsin's SIP. These revisions include amendments to the Wisconsin Administrative Code (WAC), Chapter NR 422. These revisions are approvable because they are consistent with the latest Control Techniques Guideline (CTG) for Offset Lithographic Printing and Letterpress Printing, published by EPA in 2006, and such revisions clarify and streamline the VOC reasonably available control technology (RACT) requirements for lithographic printing facilities located in nine counties in Wisconsin (Kenosha, Kewaunee, Manitowoc, Milwaukee, Ozaukee, Racine, Sheboygan, Washington, and Waukesha). EPA proposed to approve this action on September 25, 2020 and received no comments.
