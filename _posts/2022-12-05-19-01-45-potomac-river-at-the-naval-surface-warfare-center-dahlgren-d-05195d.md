## Summary

The Corps of Engineers is proposing to amend its regulations for an existing danger zone in the waters of the Potomac River near Dahlgren, Virginia. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) operates research, development, testing, and evaluation ranges on the Potomac River using the danger zones as defined in the existing regulation. The NSWCDD range operations center controls Navy operations on the Potomac River Test Range. The purpose of this amendment is to expand the middle danger zone for ongoing infrared sensor testing for detection of airborne chemical or biological agent simulants, directed energy testing, and for operating manned or unmanned watercraft. This amendment will extend the legal authority to engage civilian watercraft for safe transit instructions in the Potomac River within the expanded middle danger zone.
