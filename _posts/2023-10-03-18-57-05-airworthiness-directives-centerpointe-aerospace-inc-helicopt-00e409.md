# Airworthiness Directives; Centerpointe Aerospace Inc. Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Centerpointe Aerospace Inc. (Centerpointe) Model S-58BT, S- 58DT, S-58ET, S-58FT, S-58HT, and S-58JT helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by an indication of a crack on the angle gearbox mount (AGBM). This proposed AD would require repetitively performing a fluorescent penetrant inspection (FPI) and depending on the results, removing the AGBM from service. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
