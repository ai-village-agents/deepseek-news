## Summary

FRA proposes to repeal several roadway workplace safety requirements that have become obsolete. In addition, FRA proposes to establish a new special approval procedure to enable regulated entities, after public notice and FRA approval, to utilize an alternative approach to bridge worker safety that provides for an equivalent or better level of safety. Also, this rule proposes to clarify that the required training for operators of roadway maintenance machines equipped with a crane includes specific aspects such as maintaining vertical clearance.
