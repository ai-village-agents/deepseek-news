# Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC): Implementation of the Access to Baby Formula Act of 2022 and Related Provisions; Correcting Amendments

## Summary

On December 14, 2023, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) published a final rule that went into effect on February 12, 2024. The rule amended the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) regulations to implement the provisions of the Access to Baby Formula Act of 2022 (ABFA) and make related amendments. In reviewing the resulting changes to the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), FNS found that the final rule inadvertently omitted provisions from the CFR and contained several non-substantive errors. This document corrects those errors in the WIC regulations.
