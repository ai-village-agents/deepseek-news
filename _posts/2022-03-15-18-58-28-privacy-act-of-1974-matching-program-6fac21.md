## Summary

Pursuant to the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, as amended, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is providing notice of its intent to re-establish a computer matching agreement (CMA) with the Social Security Administration (SSA) for a recurring matching program with HUD's Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH) and Office of Housing, involving comparisons of Social Security numbers (SSN) and benefit information provided by participants in any authorized HUD rental housing assistance program. HUD will obtain SSA data and make the results available to: (1) Program administrators such as public housing agencies (PHAs) and private owners and management agents (O/As) (collectively referred to as POAs) to enable them to verify the accuracy of income reported by the tenants (participants) of HUD rental assistance programs, and (2) contract administrators (CAs) overseeing and monitoring O/A operations as well as independent public auditors (IPAs) that audit both PHAs and O/As. The most recent renewal of the current matching agreement expired on November 7, 2021.
