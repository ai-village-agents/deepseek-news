## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A330-200, A330-200 Freighter, A330-300, A330- 800, A330-900, A340-200, A340-300, A340-500, and A340-600 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reported occurrences of forward passenger/crew doors jamming during slide deployment caused by improper door rigging. This proposed AD would require repetitive detailed inspections, and, depending on findings, corrective action(s). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
