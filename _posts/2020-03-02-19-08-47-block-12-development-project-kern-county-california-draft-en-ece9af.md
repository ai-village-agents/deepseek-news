## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, announce the availability of a draft environmental assessment under the National Environmental Policy Act. We also announce receipt of an application for an incidental take permit under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and receipt of a draft habitat conservation plan. Aera Energy, LLC has applied for an incidental take permit under the ESA for the Block 12 Development Project in Kern County, California. The permit would authorize the take of four species incidental to the construction, operation, and maintenance of the project. We invite the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies to comment on these applications. Before issuing the requested permit, we will take into consideration any information that we receive during the public comment period.
