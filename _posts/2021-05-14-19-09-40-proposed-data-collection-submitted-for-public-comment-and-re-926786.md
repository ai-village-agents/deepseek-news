## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled, Nurse Fatigue-Mitigation Education: Does it Change Nurse Sleep Behavior? The purpose of this project is to evaluate the online NIOSH Training for Nurses on Shift Work and Long Work Hours for effectiveness at improving nurse sleep and well-being. Study 1 describes the nurses who have taken the training since first published on the NIOSH website in 2015. Study 2 assesses the effectiveness of the training on nurse sleep health and well-being over a six-month post-training period.
