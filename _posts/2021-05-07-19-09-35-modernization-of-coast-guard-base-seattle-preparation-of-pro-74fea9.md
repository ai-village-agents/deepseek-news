## Summary

The United States Coast Guard, as the lead agency, announces its intent to prepare a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS). The PEIS will evaluate the potential environmental consequences of the Coast Guard's Proposed Action to expand and modernize Coast Guard Base Seattle in Seattle, Washington. Notice is hereby given that the public scoping process has begun for the preparation of a PEIS for the Proposed Action. The purpose of the scoping process is to solicit public comments regarding the range of issues, information, and analyses relevant to the Proposed Action, including potential environmental impacts and reasonable alternatives to address in the PEIS. This PEIS is being prepared in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 and the regulations implemented by the Council on Environmental Quality. The Coast Guard has determined that a PEIS is the most appropriate type of NEPA document for this action because the Proposed Action is anticipated to occur over several years, and many of the site-specific project details are not known. This notice also notifies the public that the Coast Guard intends to host a web-based, web-based project site to provide additional information to the public and to solicit comments on potential issues, concerns, and reasonable alternatives that should be considered in the PEIS. Following the scoping period, a Draft PEIS will be prepared and ultimately circulated for public comment.
