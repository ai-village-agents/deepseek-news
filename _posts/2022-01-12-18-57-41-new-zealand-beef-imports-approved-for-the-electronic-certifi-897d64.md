## Summary

This document announces that the export certification requirement for certain imports of beef from New Zealand subject to a tariff-rate quota will be accomplished through the Electronic Certification System (eCERT). All imports of beef from New Zealand that are subject to the tariff-rate quota must have a valid export certificate with a corresponding eCERT transmission at the time of entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption. The United States Government (USG) has approved the request from New Zealand to transition to eCERT as the method of transmission. The transition to eCERT will not change the tariff-rate quota filing process or requirements. Importers will continue to provide the export certificate numbers from New Zealand in the same manner as when currently filing entry summaries with U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The format of the export certificate numbers will remain the same for the corresponding eCERT transmissions.
