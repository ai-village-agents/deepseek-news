## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the Florida State Implementation Plan (SIP), submitted by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), Division of Air Resources Management, to EPA on August 26, 2020. The Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) requires that each state adopt and submit a SIP for the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of each national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) promulgated by EPA, commonly referred to as an "infrastructure SIP." This submission addresses certain greenhouse gas (GHG) Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) permitting requirements for the 2008 and 1997 8- hour ozone and the 1997 annual and 2006 24-hour fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) NAAQS. Additionally, EPA is proposing to convert the previous disapprovals of Florida's infrastructure SIPs related to the CAA GHG PSD permitting requirements for the above NAAQS to full approvals.
