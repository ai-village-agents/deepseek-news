## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to fully approve a delegation request submitted by the Washington State Department of Health (WDOH) for full delegation of authority to implement and enforce the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for radionuclide air emissions. The EPA granted WDOH partial delegation of authority to implement and enforce these standards effective July 5, 2006. The WDOH has addressed the partial approval issues, has updated its adoption of the applicable Federal standards to address all current Federal requirements, and has submitted to the EPA a request for full delegation of these standards.
