## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Model Trent XWB-97 engines. This AD was prompted by a report of damage to the main fuel hose assembly of the fuel manifold, which resulted an in-flight shut down. This AD requires a one-time set of visual and dimensional inspections of the main fuel hose assembly of the fuel manifold to confirm softness, compliance, and lack of resistance, and for shrinkage, cracks, chafing, dents, kinks, necking, and degradation of the hose braid wire; and, if necessary, replacement of the main fuel hose assembly of the fuel manifold, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
