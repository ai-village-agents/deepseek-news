## Summary

The NCUA Board proposes to amend its regulations concerning the reimbursement of reasonable expenses for federal credit union (FCU) officials. The proposed rule would enable FCU boards to establish policies that allow for the payment of reasonable dependent care costs incurred by volunteer officials while attending board meetings and performing their official duties. This proposed amendment would include dependent care costs as a reimbursable expense. The proposed changes aim to provide FCUs with greater flexibility to create family-friendly policies, thereby alleviating dependent care costs for volunteer officials, which may otherwise hinder their ability to volunteer.
