## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing approval of a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of North Dakota on August 3, 2020, addressing regional haze. Specifically, EPA is approving Amendment No. 2 to the North Dakota SIP for Regional Haze to satisfy certain requirements for the first implementation period of the Clean Air Act's (CAA) regional haze program. Amendment No. 2 adopts the same regional haze requirements for nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) for Antelope Valley Station Units 1 and 2 promulgated by EPA in our 2012 Federal Implementation Plan (FIP). In conjunction with the approval of Amendment No. 2, we are also withdrawing the 2012 FIP as it applies to the Antelope Valley Station as well as certain provisions related to Coal Creek Station that were vacated by a judicial determination. EPA will work with North Dakota to ensure that the State corrects the SIP deficiencies related to Coal Creek Station. EPA is finalizing this action pursuant to sections 110 and 169A of the CAA.
