## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) concerning particulate matter (PM) and oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) emissions from public transit buses. We are proposing to approve State rules that regulate these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act). We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
