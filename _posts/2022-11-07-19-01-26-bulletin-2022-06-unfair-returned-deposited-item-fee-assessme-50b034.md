# Bulletin 2022-06: Unfair Returned Deposited Item Fee Assessment Practices

**Published:** February 05, 2026 19:01 UTC

## Summary

A Returned Deposited Item is a check that a consumer deposits into their checking account that is returned to the consumer because the check could not be processed against the check originator's account. Blanket policies of charging Returned Deposited Item fees to consumers for all returned transactions irrespective of the circumstances or patterns of behavior on the account are likely unfair under the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA). The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau or CFPB) is issuing this bulletin to notify regulated entities how the Bureau intends to exercise its enforcement and supervisory authorities on this issue.
