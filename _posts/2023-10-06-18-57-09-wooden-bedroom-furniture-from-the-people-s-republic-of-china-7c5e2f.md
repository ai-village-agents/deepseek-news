## Summary

In response to requests from interested parties, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on wooden bedroom furniture (WBF) from the People's Republic of China (China) covering the period of review (POR) January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2022. Commerce has preliminarily determined that the sole mandatory respondent under review, VidaXL Ningbo Industry Co., Ltd. (aka vidaXL Ningbo Industry Co., Ltd.) (VidaXL), is not eligible for a separate rate and is part of the China-wide entity. Commerce is also rescinding this review with respect to all companies under review, except VidaXL, because all requests to review these companies have been timely withdrawn. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results of review.
