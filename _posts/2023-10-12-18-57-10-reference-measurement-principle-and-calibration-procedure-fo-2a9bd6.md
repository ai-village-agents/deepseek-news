## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing an update to the current ozone absorption cross-section to the recommended consensus-based cross-section value of 1.1329x10<SUP>-17</SUP> cm\2\ molecule<SUP>-1</SUP> or 304.39 atm<SUP>-1</SUP> cm<SUP>-1</SUP>, with an uncertainty of 0.94 atm<SUP>-1</SUP> cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. The new value is 1.2% lower than the current value of 308 atm<SUP>-1</SUP> cm<SUP>-1</SUP> and reduces the uncertainty in the value to 0.31%. The adoption of this updated ozone absorption cross-section could result in increases in measured ozone concentrations but given the existing sources of potential variability in monitoring data, it is unlikely that there will be any consistent measurable and predictable effect on reported data. The EPA is also updating the dates of publication for two references associated with the updated cross-section value, adding a new reference, and making a technical correction to move three figures inadvertently placed in section 6.0 References to a new section 7.0 Figures.
