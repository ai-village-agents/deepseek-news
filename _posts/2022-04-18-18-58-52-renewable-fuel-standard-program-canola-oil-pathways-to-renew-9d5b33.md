## Summary

In this proposed rule, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is providing an opportunity for comment on a proposed analysis of the lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with certain biofuels that are produced from canola/rapeseed oil. This assessment considers diesel, jet fuel, heating oil, naphtha, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) produced from canola/rapeseed oil via a hydrotreating process, and proposes to find that these pathways would meet the lifecycle GHG emissions reduction threshold of 50 percent required for advanced biofuels and biomass-based diesel under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program. Based on these analyses, EPA is proposing to approve these fuel pathways, making them eligible to generate Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs), provided they satisfy the other definitional and RIN generation criteria for renewable fuel specified in the RFS regulations.
