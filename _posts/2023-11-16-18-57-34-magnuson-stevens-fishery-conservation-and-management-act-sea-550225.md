## Summary

The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) withdraws the Seafood Import Monitoring Program (SIMP) proposed rule, which was published in the Federal Register on December 28, 2022. The SIMP proposed rule intended to add species to SIMP pursuant to the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. In addition, the proposed rule would have amended SIMP regulations to clarify the responsibilities and definitions, and make other necessary administrative modernizations. In light of the extensive public comments received regarding the December 2022 proposed rule, NMFS has decided to conduct a comprehensive program review in order to strengthen the impact and effectiveness of SIMP. Critical aspects of that review will include better defining the problem that we are working to address and establishing clear, achievable goals through constructive engagement with our stakeholders. Comments received on the December 2022 proposed rule will also be taken into consideration as part of the review. While NMFS conducts this comprehensive review, SIMP will continue to operate in its current form, all existing requirements remain in force, and the list of priority species currently subject to SIMP requirements remains unchanged. In addition, NMFS will continue to support industry and other stakeholders in SIMP compliance during the review.
