## Summary

We are proposing to request approval of a new information collection from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). We are beginning a new recruitment program that connects veterans and Schedule A-eligible applicants with an opportunity for non-competitive employment. We propose to collect information from people who are interested in these opportunities in order to consider them for the positions and match them with possible jobs. The collection includes approval of a form, NARA Employment Interest Questionnaire, NA Form 3102. We invite you to comment on this proposed information collection.
