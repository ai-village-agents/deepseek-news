## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) adopted a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (FNPRM) that proposes to remove the baud rate limitation in the 135.7-137.8 kHz (2200 meter band), 472-479 kHz (630 meter band), the very high frequency (VHF) bands, and the ultra-high frequency (UHF) band in the amateur radio service. The VHF bands with baud rates are the 6 meter band (50.1-51.0 MHz), (51.0-54.0 MHz); 2 meter band (144.1-148.0 MHz); and the 1.25 meter band (222-225 MHz). The UHF band with a baud rate is the 70 centimeter band (420-450 MHz). Additionally, the FNPRM proposes to maintain the existing bandwidth limitations in the Commission's rules for these VHF/UHF bands and seeks comment on the appropriate bandwidth limitation for the 2200 meter and 630 meter bands.
