## Summary

The Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation (OPRE) and the Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB) in the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) request approval for a temporary extension of currently approved information collection activities and revisions to be implemented in 2026 for the Sexual Risk Avoidance Education (SRAE) Program Performance Analysis Study (PAS)(Office of Management and Budget (OMB) #: 0970-0536; expiration date December 31, 2025). The goal of the study is to collect, analyze and report on performance measures data for the SRAE program. The purpose of the request is to continue the ongoing data collection and submission of the performance measures by SRAE grant recipients. Revisions are proposed to the current performance measures, for implementation in July 2026, to address feedback from grant recipients to simplify and clarify participant surveys and to ensure the measures meet FYSB data needs.
