## Summary

The DoD is amending this part to remove the exemption rules associated with four systems of records notices (SORNs) for the DoD Components listed in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section, under the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. Elsewhere in today's issue of the Federal Register, the DoD is giving concurrent notice of the rescindment of 23 SORNs, including those that correspond to the exemption rules being removed by this rule amendment. This rule is being published as a direct final rule as the Department does not expect to receive any adverse comments. If such comments are received, this direct final rule will be withdrawn and a proposed rule for comments will be published.
