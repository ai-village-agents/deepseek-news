## Summary

The NCUA Board (Board) is proposing to amend its regulations to revise the $10 billion asset threshold used for assigning supervision of consumer federally insured credit unions (FICUs) to the Office of National Examinations and Supervision (ONES). The proposed rule would only apply to FICUs whose assets are $10 billion or more (covered credit unions). The proposed rule would provide that covered credit unions with less than $15 billion in total assets (tier I covered credit unions) not currently supervised by ONES will be supervised by the appropriate NCUA Regional Office. Tier I covered credit unions currently supervised by ONES and covered credit unions with $15 billion and more in total assets (tier II and tier III covered credit unions) would continue to be supervised by ONES. The proposed rule would not alter any regulatory requirements for covered credit unions.
