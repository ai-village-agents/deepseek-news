## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve, under the Clean Air Act (CAA), revised sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) regulations submitted by Ohio on May 23, 2022. Ohio updated its regulations to correct facility information which has changed, remove requirements for shutdown facilities and units, update references, consolidate county-wide requirements, address style changes, and revise requirements for the Veolia Fort Hill plant in Miami, Ohio and DTE St. Bernard facility in Cincinnati, Ohio. EPA believes that the revisions improve the clarity of the rules without affecting the stringency and therefore is proposing to approve the submitted revisions with exception of selected paragraphs in Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) Chapter 3745-18.
