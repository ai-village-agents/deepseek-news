## Summary

In this document the Commission proposes to adopt three footnotes to the Table of Frequency Allocations to address the use of spectrum by manned and unmanned spacecraft during space missions. The Commission also seeks further comment on whether to include new spectrum allocations in specific bands for communications with cargo and crew capsules and payload communications with the International Space Station (ISS) and other crewed space stations. In addition, the Commission seeks further comment on expanding the use of the 2360-2395 MHz band, both in the context of additional uses to the band as well as expanding use in the band beyond the three frequencies currently designated for telemetry and telecommand operations of launch vehicles.
