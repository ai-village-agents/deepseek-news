## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-800 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that the compliance time for the initial ultrasonic inspection required by AD 2019-11-06 is insufficient for certain airplanes. This AD requires reducing the compliance time for the ultrasonic inspection of the skin under the drag link assembly. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
