## Summary

This action is an administrative change to rename the location of restricted areas R-6302A, R-6302B, R-6302C, R-6302D, and R-6302E and to update the name of the listed using agency for those restricted areas. This action partially implements recommendations of the Commission on the Naming of Items (Naming Commission) of the Department of Defense (DoD) as established by section 370 of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Additionally, this action makes minor editorial corrections to the designated altitudes contained in three of the restricted areas and to the geographic coordinates of one boundary point in one of the restricted areas. These amendments do not affect the overall restricted area complex boundaries, operational altitudes, times of designation, or activities conducted within the airspace.
