## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-15-07 for certain Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) (type certificate previously held by Rolls-Royce plc) Model RB211-524G2-19, RB211-524G2- T-19, RB211-524G3-19, RB211-524G3-T-19, RB211-524H2-19, RB211-524H2-T- 19, RB211-524H-36, and RB211-524H-T-36 engines. AD 2020-15-07 required replacement of the low-pressure turbine (LPT) stage 1 disk with part number (P/N) UL37606, UL37607, UL37608, UL37722, or UL37790, installed. This AD was prompted by an updated analysis by the engine manufacturer, which indicates certain part-numbered and serial-numbered LPT stage 1 disks that have undergone rework could fail before the current published life limits. This AD retains the requirement to replace the LPT stage 1 disk and includes additional LPT stage 1 disks, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
