## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission or Agency) is modifying a system of records, FCC/OSP-1, Broadband Dead Zone Report and Consumer Broadband Test, subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. This action is necessary to implement the Broadband Data Collection (BDC) program. The modified system, now known as FCC/OEA-6, Broadband Data Collection system of records (BDC system), will collect granular, detailed information on the availability and quality of service of fixed and mobile broadband internet access service from service providers, as well as verified broadband availability data from other Federal agencies, from State, local, and Tribal governmental entities that are primarily responsible for mapping or tracking broadband service coverage, and from other third parties. The BDC will additionally give the FCC, industry, Federal, State, local and Tribal government entities, and consumers the tools they need to continuously refine and improve the accuracy of these new mapping data. A number of broadband deployment funding mechanisms will rely upon BDC data, including the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program, administered by the Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), the FCC's 5G Fund for Rural America, and potentially other broadband infrastructure deployment funding programs.
