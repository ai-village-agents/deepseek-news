## Summary

This action delays the effective date of the final rule published in the Federal Register on January 16, 2025 amending Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal Airways V-68, V-212, and V-222, and United States Area Navigation (RNAV) Route T-220; and revoking VOR Federal Airway V-558. This is the second delay of the original effective date for this final rule published in the Federal Register on December 9, 2024. The FAA is delaying the effective date to allow sufficient time for completing the redesign and flight inspection of a Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR) instrument procedure into George Bush Intercontinental/Houston Airport, TX, that failed the initial and follow-up flight inspections.
