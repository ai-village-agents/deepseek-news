## Summary

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, invites the general public to take this opportunity to comment on an extension, with change, of a currently approved information collection. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice seeks comments concerning the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) Individuals and Households Program, providing financial assistance to individuals whose primary residences were destroyed as a result of a Presidentially-declared disaster. This revision reduces the overall burden on the public by updating the amount of time needed to complete most of the instruments in this collection.
