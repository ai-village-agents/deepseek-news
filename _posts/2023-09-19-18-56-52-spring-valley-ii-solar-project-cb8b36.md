## Summary

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) intends to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the purchase of electricity generated by the proposed Spring Valley II Solar Project in Colbert County, Alabama. The EIS will assess the potential environmental effects of constructing, operating, and maintaining the proposed 178- megawatt (MW) alternating current (AC) solar facility that would occupy approximately 943 acres of the 1,629-acre project study area. Public comments are invited concerning the scope of the EIS, alternatives being considered, and environmental issues that should be addressed as a part of this EIS. TVA is also requesting data, information, and analysis relevant to the proposed action from the public; affected federal, state, tribal, and local governments, agencies, and offices; the scientific community; industry; or any other interested party.
