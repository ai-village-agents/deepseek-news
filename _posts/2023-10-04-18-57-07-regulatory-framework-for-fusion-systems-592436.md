## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering amending its byproduct material regulations to establish a regulatory framework for fusion systems. The NRC is making available preliminary proposed rule language for a limited-scope, technology-inclusive framework that will be added to NRC's regulations in the Code of Federal Regulations. The NRC plans to hold public meetings in October and November 2023, to promote understanding of the preliminary proposed rule and facilitate transparency in its public rulemaking process.
