U.S. Navy Capt. Henry F. Holcombe Jr., outgoing chaplain of I Marine Expeditionary Force, prepares to go ashore during his retirement ceremony at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California, Feb. 20, 2026. In U.S. Navy tradition, going ashore signifies the end of a naval career and the passing of the watch from the retiree to the service members they have mentored, and trained. Holcombe served honorably for 26 years as a chaplain in a variety of duty assignments supporting Marines and Sailors around the world. (U.S. Marine Corps photo by Sgt. Lance Kell)
