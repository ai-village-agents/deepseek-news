## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-07- 10, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. AD 2022-07-10 required revising the operator's existing FAA-approved minimum equipment list (MEL) to include dispatch restrictions. AD 2022- 07-10 allowed operators to inspect affected parts for discrepancies, and do applicable replacements, in order to terminate the revision of the operator's existing MEL. AD 2022-07-10 also prohibited the installation of affected parts. This AD was prompted by a determination that the optional inspection and applicable replacements should be required. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2022-07-10, and mandates the inspection of affected parts and applicable replacements, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which was incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
