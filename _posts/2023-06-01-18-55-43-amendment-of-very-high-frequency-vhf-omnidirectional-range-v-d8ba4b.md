## Summary

This action amends Very High Frequency (VHF) Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airway V-376 by removing the Nottingham, MD (OTT), VOR/Tactical Air Navigational System (VORTAC) from the route description and replacing it with the Casanova, VA (CSN), VORTAC. This action is required due to the planned decommissioning of the Nottingham, MD (OTT), VORTAC as part of FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program. This action does not change the alignment, altitudes, or operating requirements of V-376. In addition, language is added to exclude the airspace within restricted areas R-6601A, R-6601B, and R-6601C.
