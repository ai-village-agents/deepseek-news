## Summary

NMFS is prohibiting recreational fishing for Chinook salmon in the Cook Inlet exclusive economic zone (EEZ) Area. This action is necessary for the conservation of Cook Inlet Chinook salmon stocks that continue to be in a low state of abundance as assessed in the NMFS 2025 stock assessment and fisheries evaluation (SAFE) report and the 2025 State of Alaska forecasts of very low run strength.
