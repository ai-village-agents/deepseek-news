## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is adopting clarifications to the test procedures for general service lamps ("GSLs") located in appendix W, appendix BB and appendix DD. Specifically, DOE is clarifying instructions that GSLs must not be tested as colored lamps and that lamps with additional components that do not affect light output must be turned off during testing. The clarifications also specify that non-integrated lamps be tested with a fluorescent lamp ballast, high intensity discharge ("HID") lamp ballast or external light-emitting diode ("LED") driver selected based on compatibility lists and availability; and provide specifications regarding the starting method, ballast factor, and number of lamps. This rulemaking is limited in scope and is providing clarifications to the current test procedures that are required for certification of compliance with existing applicable GSL energy conservation standards. Further, this rulemaking does not satisfy the Energy Policy and Conservation Act ("EPCA") requirement that, at least once every 7 years, DOE review the test procedures for GSLs.
