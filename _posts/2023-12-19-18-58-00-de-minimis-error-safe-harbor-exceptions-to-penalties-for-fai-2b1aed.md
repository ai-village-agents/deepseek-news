## Summary

This document contains final regulations implementing statutory safe harbor rules that protect persons required to file information returns or to furnish payee statements from penalties under the Internal Revenue Code (Code) for failure to file correct information returns or furnish correct payee statements. The statutory safe harbor rules treat information returns and payee statements with erroneous dollar amounts as correct returns or statements for certain penalty purposes if the errors are de minimis in dollar amount. The final regulations also prescribe the time and manner in which a payee may elect not to have the statutory safe harbor rules apply. In addition, these final regulations update dollar amounts, definitions, and references in existing regulations relating to information return and payee statement penalties to reflect various statutory amendments to the Code that are not accounted for in the existing regulations. Finally, the final regulations provide rules relating to the reporting of basis of securities by brokers as this reporting relates to the de minimis error safe harbor rules. The final regulations affect persons required to either file information returns or to furnish payee statements (filers) and the recipients of payee statements (payees).
