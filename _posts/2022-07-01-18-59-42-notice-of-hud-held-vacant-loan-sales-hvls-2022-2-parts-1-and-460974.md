## Summary

This notice reports HUD's recent June 8th competitive sale offering of 1,406 reverse mortgage loans secured by vacant or abandoned properties with a loan balance of approximately $336 million (June sale or HVLS 2022-2, Part 1). The June sale consisted of one national pool and one single-asset pool secured by a vacant lot in Omaha, Nebraska (Single asset pool or Land only asset). The Secretary offered these assets to qualified nonprofit or unit of state or local government bidders and joint ventures with a charitable 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization or unit of government carrying out a governmental public purpose. This was the eighth sale offering of its type. For the June sale, approximately 700 of these mortgage loans were awarded on or about June 13, 2022. The approximately 700 remaining mortgage loans, including the Land only asset, will be offered again on or about July 27th in one national pool (July sale or HVLS 2022-2, Part 2). Terms and conditions of that July sale are outlined later in this document. Also, this notice generally describes the bidding process for the sale and certain persons who are ineligible to bid.
