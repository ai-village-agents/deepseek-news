## Summary

On September 1, 2021, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") published a notice of proposed rulemaking regarding test procedures for residential clothes washers ("RCWs"), which will be used as the basis for evaluating, issuing, and determining compliance with updated energy conservation standards, should such standards be established. On September 29, 2021, DOE published a preliminary analysis of energy conservation standards for RCWs, which presented preliminary translations between the energy and water efficiency metrics as measured by the current test procedure and new energy and water efficiency metrics as measured by the proposed test procedure. In this NODA, DOE is publishing the results of additional testing conducted in furtherance of the development of the translations between the current test procedure and the proposed new test procedure. DOE requests comments, data, and information regarding the data.
