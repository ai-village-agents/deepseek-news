## Summary

NMFS implements management measures as described in an abbreviated framework action under the Fishery Management Plans (FMPs) for the Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico (Reef Fish FMP) and Coastal Migratory Pelagic (CMP) Resources of the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Region (CMP FMP). This final rule will enable a permit holder to replace a historical captain endorsement in the reef fish and CMP fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) with a standard Federal charter vessel/headboat permit in the same Gulf fisheries. NMFS expects that this final rule will reduce the potential regulatory and economic burden on historical captain permit holders.
