# Fisheries Off West Coast States; Emergency Action to Temporarily Extend the Primary Sablefish Fishery Season; Correction

## Summary

This action corrects the regulations governing the West Coast Sablefish Primary fishery after the expiration of the emergency rule to temporarily extend the 2020 season for the Sablefish Primary fishery. The amendatory instructions for the temporary rule were written incorrectly so that when the temporary rule expired, important regulations were removed and reserved rather than reinstated correctly. These corrections are necessary so the regulations accurately implement the Pacific Fishery Management Council's intent.
