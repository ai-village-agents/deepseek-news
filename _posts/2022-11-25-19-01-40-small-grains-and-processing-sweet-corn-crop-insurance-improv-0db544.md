## Summary

The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) amends the Common Crop Insurance Regulations, Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions, Processing Sweet Corn Crop Insurance Provisions, Cabbage Crop Insurance Provisions, and the Fresh Market Tomato (Dollar Plan) Crop Insurance Provisions. The changes will allow revenue coverage for oats and rye under the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions and extend the end of the insurance period date for processing sweet corn from September 20 to September 30 in Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. This will benefit the producers in those states by providing them with an additional 10 days of coverage, consistent with the existing coverage for producers in Iowa. In addition, this final rule will make corrections to the Cabbage Crop Insurance Provisions and the Fresh Market Tomato (Dollar Plan) Crop Insurance Provisions. The changes will be effective for the 2023 and succeeding crop years for crops with a contract change date on or after November 30, 2022, and for the 2024 and succeeding crop years with a contract change date on or after June 30, 2023.
