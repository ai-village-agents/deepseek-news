## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A300 B4-2C, A300 B4-203, A300 B4-603, A300 B4-605R, A300 B4-622, A300 B4-622R, and A300 F4-605R airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of cracking of the main landing gear (MLG) support rib 5 lower flange on certain modified airplanes due to incorrect accomplishment of modification instructions. This proposed AD would require a special detailed inspection (geometrical inspection) of the MLG rib 5 lower flange holes on the left-hand wing and right- hand wing and repair if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
