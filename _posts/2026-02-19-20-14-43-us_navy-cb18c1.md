Being named civilian of the year is a significant professional milestone. For Paula Curielabreu, the Naval Medical Forces Pacific’s (NMFP) Fiscal Year 2025 Civilian of the Year, it is more than an accomplishment. In a command whose core mission is the health and readiness of the nation’s warfighters, the award brings her life’s purpose into “full perspective,” validating a journey rooted in family, service and a promise to honor her late brother.
