## Summary

This rulemaking proposes updating the prospective payment rates for inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs) for Federal fiscal year (FY) 2023. As required by statute, this proposed rule includes the classification and weighting factors for the IRF prospective payment system's case-mix groups and a description of the methodologies and data used in computing the prospective payment rates for FY 2023. In addition, we are proposing to codify CMS' existing teaching status adjustment policy through proposed amendments to the regulation text and proposing to update and clarify the IRF teaching policy with respect to IRF hospital closures and displaced residents. In this proposed rule, we are also soliciting comments on the methodology for updating the facility level adjustment factors. Additionally, we are soliciting comments regarding the IRF transfer payment policy. This rule proposes to establish a permanent cap policy to smooth the impact of year-to-year changes in IRF payments related to changes in the IRF wage index. This proposed rule also includes updates for the IRF Quality Reporting Program (QRP).
