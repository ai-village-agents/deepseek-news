## Summary

Each year, the Department of Defense issues a Schedule of Remuneration used by states for UCX purposes. States must use the schedule to determine Federal military wages for UCX "first claims" only when the Federal Claims Control Center (FCCC) responds to a request for information indicating that there is no Copy 5 of the Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty (DD Form 214) for an individual under the social security number provided. A response from the FCCC that indicates "no DD214 on file" will prompt the state to start the affidavit process and to use the attached schedule to calculate the Federal military wages for an unemployment insurance or UCX monetary determination. The schedule applies to UCX "first claims" filed beginning with the first day of the first week that begins on or after January 1, 2022, pursuant to the UCX program regulations (see 20 CFR 614.12(c)). States must continue to use the 2021 schedule (or other appropriate schedule) for UCX "first claims" filed before the effective date of the revised schedule.
