## Summary

The United States Postal Service (Postal Service), with the concurrence of the United States Office of Government Ethics (OGE), amends the Supplemental Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the United States Postal Service by updating and refining outside employment and activity provisions (including prior approval requirements and prohibitions), by adding new requirements applicable to Postal Service Office of Inspector General (OIG) employees, Postal Service Governors, the Postmaster General, and the Deputy Postmaster General, and by making limited technical and ministerial changes. In response to the proposed rule, the Postal Service received two sets of comments, which it addresses here.
