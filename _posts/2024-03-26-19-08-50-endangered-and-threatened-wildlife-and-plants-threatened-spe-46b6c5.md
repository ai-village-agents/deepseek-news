## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to list the pygmy three-toed sloth (Bradypus pygmaeus; hereafter "pygmy sloth"), an arboreal mammal species from Panama, as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). This determination also serves as our 12-month finding on a petition to list the pygmy sloth. After a review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that listing the species is warranted. Accordingly, we propose to list the pygmy sloth as a threatened species with a rule issued under section 4(d) of the Act ("4(d) rule"). If we finalize this rule as proposed, it will add this species to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and extend the Act's protections to the species.
