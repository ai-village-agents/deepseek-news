# Fisheries of the Exclusive Economic Zone Off Alaska; Inseason Adjustment to the 2026 Aleutian Islands Pacific Cod Total Allowable Catch Amount and Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Pacific Cod Allocations

## Summary

NMFS is adjusting the 2026 total allowable catch (TAC) amount for Aleutian Islands (AI) Pacific cod and the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) Pacific cod sector allocations and seasonal apportionments. NMFS has determined the AI Pacific cod TAC is incorrectly specified and these adjustments will address the underharvest of BSAI Pacific cod TACs that would result if the TACs were not adjusted. This action is consistent with the goals and objectives of the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the BSAI Management Area (FMP).
