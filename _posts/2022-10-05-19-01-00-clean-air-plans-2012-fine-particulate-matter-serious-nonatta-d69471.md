## Summary

On December 29, 2021, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or "Agency") published a proposed rule to approve the State of California's Serious area plan for the San Joaquin Valley (SJV) for the 2012 annual fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for all Serious PM<INF>2.5</INF> area planning requirements, except for contingency measures, which the EPA proposed to disapprove. Based on adverse comments submitted on that proposed rule and as a result of a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision on a related SJV PM<INF>2.5</INF> rulemaking for the 2006 24- hour PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS, the EPA has reconsidered its prior proposal and now proposes to disapprove the State's plan for certain Serious area planning requirements for the 2012 annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS. The nonattainment plan elements that the EPA proposes to disapprove include the plan's best available control measures (BACM) demonstration for ammonia and building heating, demonstrations of attainment and reasonable further progress, quantitative milestones, and motor vehicle emission budgets. The EPA is also proposing to disapprove the State's optional precursor demonstration for ammonia. We are not re-proposing any action on the Serious area requirements for emissions inventories nor contingency measures; our prior proposal to approve the emissions inventory element and to disapprove the contingency measure element of the nonattainment plan requirements for the 2012 annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS remains unchanged. The EPA will accept comments on this new proposed rule during a 45-day public comment period and public hearing, as described in this notice.
