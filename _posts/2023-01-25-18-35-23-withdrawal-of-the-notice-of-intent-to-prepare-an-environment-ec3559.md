## Summary

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Memphis District is terminating preparation of a Draft Integrated Feasibility Report and Environmental Impact Statement (DIFR-EIS) for the Hatchie-Loosahatchie Mississippi River Ecosystem Restoration Study. A Notice of Intent to prepare the DIFR-EIS was published in the November 4, 2022, issue of the Federal Register. The USACE has since determined that a Draft Integrated Feasibility Report and Environmental Assessment (DIFR-EA) rather than an EIS is the appropriate level of environmental documentation for the study.
