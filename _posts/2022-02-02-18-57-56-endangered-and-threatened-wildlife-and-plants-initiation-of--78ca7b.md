## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, are initiating 5-year status reviews of 40 species in California, Nevada, and Oregon under the Endangered Species Act. A 5-year review is based on the best scientific and commercial data available at the time of the review; therefore, we are requesting submission of any new information on these species that has become available since the last review.
