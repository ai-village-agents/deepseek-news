## Summary

In this document, the Commission proposes to revise our rules to provide additional opportunities for unlicensed white space devices operating in the broadcast television bands (TV Bands) to deliver wireless broadband services in rural areas and applications associated with the Internet of Things (IOT). Therefore, the Commission offers several proposals to spur continued growth of the white space device ecosystem, especially for providing affordable broadband service to rural and underserved communities that can help close the digital divide.
