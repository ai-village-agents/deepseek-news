## Summary

NMFS proposes to approve and implement Framework Adjustment 34 to the Atlantic Sea Scallop Fishery Management Plan that establishes scallop specifications and other management measures for fishing years 2022 and 2023. Framework 34 would incorporate the new specifications- setting methodology and other changes developed by Amendment 21 to the Atlantic Sea Scallop Fishery Management Plan into the 2022 fishing year specifications, as well implement measures for fishing years 2022 and 2023to protect small scallops, promote scallop recruitment in the mid- Atlantic, and reduce bycatch of flatfish. This action would also address regulatory text that is unnecessary, outdated, or unclear. This action is necessary to prevent overfishing and improve both yield-per- recruit and the overall management of the Atlantic sea scallop resource.
