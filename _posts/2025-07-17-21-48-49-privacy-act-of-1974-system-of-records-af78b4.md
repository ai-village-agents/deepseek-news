## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) proposes to modify and republish its existing system of records, titled "OPM/Internal--18, CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service (SFS) Records." The overall purpose of this system is to administer, evaluate, and report on the CyberCorps[supreg] program, which involves the awarding of SFSs to students enrolled in participating academic institutions and assuring the students meet the SFS requirements. The students who receive an SFS (scholars) are selected by participating academic institutions and then approved by OPM. While participating in the program, they are expected to keep their profile, resume, contact information, and internship and post- graduate commitment information updated in the system. Approved OPM and National Science Foundation (NSF) staff who oversee the program (CyberCorps[supreg] program staff) use the system to monitor scholars' progress toward meeting the SFS requirements. Approved staff who work for the academic institutions where scholars are or were enrolled (academic institution officials) use the system to review some information about the scholars from their academic institution to help ensure they are meeting their SFS requirements. Approved individuals representing organizations where scholars can intern or work to meet their SFS requirements (agency hiring officials) use the system to review scholars' resumes to identify who might be interested and able to intern and work for their agency.
