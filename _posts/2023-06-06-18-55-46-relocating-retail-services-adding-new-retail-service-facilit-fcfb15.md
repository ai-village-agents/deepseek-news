## Summary

This interim rule revises regulations concerning public notification and solicitation of comments regarding the relocation or addition of retail service facilities. It establishes written notice as the standard method for notifying the public of plans to add or relocate a retail service facility, rather than in-person meetings. In addition, the interim rule revises the scope of relocations subject to public notice and solicitation of community comments to exclude relocations within a single development of buildings that share access points from a public right of way. The interim rule also removes a duplicative requirement to inform the community of potential construction when adding a retail service facility and makes minor technical changes.
