## Summary

In accordance with the Build America, Buy America Act ("BABA" or "the Act") this notice advises that HUD has issued a departmentwide public interest De Minimis and Small Grants waiver to the Buy America Domestic Content Procurement Preference ("Buy America Preference," or "BAP") as applied to the iron, steel, manufactured products, and construction materials requirement of the Act for recipients of Federal Financial Assistance ("FFA"). For the purposes of this waiver, HUD has waived the application of the BAP for infrastructure projects whose total cost (including HUD funding and funding from any other source) is an amount equal to or less than the Simplified acquisition threshold, which is currently $250,000. HUD has also waived the application of the BAP for all Small Grants of FFA provided by HUD that are equal to or below the Simplified acquisition threshold, which is currently $250,000. However, if FFA provided by HUD is combined with other FFA from another Federal agency, and the total amount of FFA in a single project is greater than the Simplified acquisition threshold, currently $250,000, then the waiver shall not apply to the FFA provided by HUD. Additionally, HUD has waived the application of the BAP for a De Minimis portion of an infrastructure project, meaning a cumulative total of no more than 5 percent of the total cost of the iron, steel, manufactured products, and construction materials used in and incorporated into the infrastructure project, up to a maximum of $1 million. In accordance with the Act, HUD has found that such De Minimis and Small Grants waivers are in the public interest. The waiver will assist HUD and its grantees and funding recipients in preventing immediate delays to critically important projects that serve to ensuring the safety and health of HUD constituents and continuing to provide economic opportunity through housing and community development projects. Moreover, this waiver will assist HUD in working to strengthen the housing market to bolster the economy and protect consumers, meet the need for quality affordable rental homes, utilize housing as a platform for improving quality of life, and build inclusive and sustainable communities free from discrimination.
