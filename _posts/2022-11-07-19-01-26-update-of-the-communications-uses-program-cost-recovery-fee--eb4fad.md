## Summary

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) proposes to amend its existing regulations to enhance the communications uses program, update its cost recovery fee schedules, and add provisions governing the development and approval of operations, maintenance, and fire prevention plans and agreements for rights-of-way (ROWs) for electric transmission and distribution facilities (powerlines). Communication uses and powerlines are two of many ROW activities authorized under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, as amended (FLPMA). Cost recovery fees apply to most ROW activities authorized under either Title V of FLPMA or the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended (MLA), as well as to land use authorizations under Title III of FLPMA.
