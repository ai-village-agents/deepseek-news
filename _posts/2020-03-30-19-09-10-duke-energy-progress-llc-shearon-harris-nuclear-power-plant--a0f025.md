## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. NFP-63, issued to Duke Energy Progress, LLC, for operation of the Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1. The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications (TSs) to include the NRC-approved topical report, ANP-10341P-A, "The ORFEO-GAIA and ORFEO-NMGRID Critical Heat Flux Correlations," and add Appendix J to DPC-NE-2005-P, "Thermal- Hydraulic Statistical Core Design Methodology." TSs would be revised to add the departure from nucleate boiling ratio safety limit for a fuel assembly design with characteristics similar to the GAIA fuel design using the ORFEO-GAIA correlation methodology. The TSs would also be revised with minor formatting editorial adjustments to the impacted pages. For this amendment request, the NRC proposes to determine that it involves no significant hazards consideration. Because this amendment request contains sensitive unclassified non-safeguards information (SUNSI), an order imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI for contention preparation.
