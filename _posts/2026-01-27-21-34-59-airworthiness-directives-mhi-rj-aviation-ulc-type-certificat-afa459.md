## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2025-22-02, which applies to certain MHI RJ Aviation ULC (type certificate previously held by Bombardier, Inc.) Model CL-600-2C10 (Regional Jet Series 700, 701 &702), CL-600-2C11 (Regional Jet Series 550), CL-600-2D15 (Regional Jet Series 705), CL-600-2D24 (Regional Jet Series 900), and CL-600-2E25 (Regional Jet Series 1000) airplanes. AD 2025-22-02 requires repetitive torque checks of the H-stab anti-yaw steady fitting block bolts. Since the FAA issued AD 2025-22-02, it was determined that additional actions must be done to address the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2025-22-02 and would require replacing the H-Stab anti-yaw steady fitting block hardware. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
