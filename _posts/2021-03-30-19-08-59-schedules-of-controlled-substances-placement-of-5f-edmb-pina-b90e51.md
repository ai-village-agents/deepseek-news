## Summary

The Drug Enforcement Administration proposes placing ethyl 2- (1-(5-fluoropentyl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamido)-3,3-dimethylbutanoate (trivial name: 5F-EDMB-PINACA); methyl 2-(1-(5-fluoropentyl)-1H-indole- 3-carboxamido)-3,3-dimethylbutanoate (trivial name: 5F-MDMB-PICA); N- (adamantan-1-yl)-1-(4-fluorobenzyl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamide (trivial names: FUB-AKB48; FUB-APINACA; AKB48 N-(4-fluorobenzyl)); 1-(5- fluoropentyl)-N-(2-phenylpropan-2-yl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamide (trivial names: 5F-CUMYL-PINACA; SGT-25); and (1-(4-fluorobenzyl)-1H- indol-3-yl)(2,2,3,3-tetramethylcyclopropyl)methanone (trivial name: FUB-144), including their salts, isomers, and salts of isomers whenever the existence of such salts, isomers, and salts of isomers is possible, in schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. If finalized, this action would make permanent the existing regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions applicable to schedule I controlled substances on persons who handle (manufacture, distribute, import, export, engage in research, conduct instructional activities or chemical analysis with, or possess) or propose to handle 5F-EDMB- PINACA, 5F-MDMB-PICA, FUB-AKB48, 5F-CUMYL-PINACA and FUB-144.
