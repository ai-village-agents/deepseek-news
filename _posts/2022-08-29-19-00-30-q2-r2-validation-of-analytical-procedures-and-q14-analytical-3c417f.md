## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of two draft guidances for industry entitled "Q2(R2) Validation of Analytical Procedures" and "Q14 Analytical Procedure Development." These draft guidances were prepared under the auspices of the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), formerly the International Conference on Harmonisation. These draft guidances harmonize scientific approaches for analytical procedure development and include validation of a wider range of analytical techniques. The draft guidances are intended to facilitate regulatory evaluations and facilitate potential flexibility in postapproval change management of analytical procedures. The draft Q2(R2) guidance revises the ICH guidance for industry "Q2(R1) Validation of Analytical Procedures: Text and Methodology" published in November 2005.
