## Summary

The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) continues to research Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving Systems (ADS) in public transportation use cases. In 2018, FTA completed its five-year Strategic Transit Automation Research Plan (STAR Plan). In preparation for the next five-year plan, FTA is issuing this request for information (RFI). This RFI seeks input from public and industry stakeholders on the next phase of research, collaboration and engagement, technology development, and demonstration of ADS or ADAS necessary to improve the safe, efficient, equitable and climate- friendly provision of public transportation and sustain the associated workforce. Comments received through this RFI will provide critical information for FTA to develop STAR Plan 2.0.
