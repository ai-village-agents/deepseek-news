## Summary

With the issuance of this final order, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration is permanently placing 2-(4- methoxybenzyl)-5-nitro-1-(2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)ethyl)-1H-benzimidazole (other names: N-pyrrolidino metonitazene or metonitazepyne) and 5- nitro-2-(4-propoxybenzyl)-1-(2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)ethyl)-1H-benzimidazole (other names: N-pyrrolidino protonitazene or protonitazepyne), including their isomers, esters, ethers, salts, and salts of isomers, esters, and ethers whenever the existence of such isomers, esters, ethers, and salts are possible within the specific chemical designation, in schedule I under the Controlled Substances Act. This action is being taken, in part, to enable the United States to meet its obligations under the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. This action imposes permanent regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions applicable to schedule I controlled substances on persons who handle (manufacture, distribute, import, export, engage in research or conduct instructional activities with or possess), or handle N-pyrrolidino metonitazene and N-pyrrolidino protonitazene.
