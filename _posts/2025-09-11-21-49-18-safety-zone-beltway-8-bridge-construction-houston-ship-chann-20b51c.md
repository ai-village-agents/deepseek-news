## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for certain navigable waters of the Houston Ship Channel around the Beltway 8 Bridge (Sam Houston Tollway Ship Channel Bridge), during bridge construction and demolition activities. The temporary safety zone is needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards created by constructing a new bridge. Entry of vessels or persons into this zone is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port, Sector Houston- Galveston. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
