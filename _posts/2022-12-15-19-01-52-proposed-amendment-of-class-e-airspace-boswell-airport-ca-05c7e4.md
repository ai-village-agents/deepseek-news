## Summary

This action proposes to modify the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Boswell Airport, CA. The radius is reduced, as there are no circling maneuvers authorized at the airport. This action also proposes the addition of an extension to the north, and a modification to the south extension to adequately contain arriving and departing aircraft. Additionally, this action proposes several administrative changes to update the airport's legal description. These actions will support the safety and management of instrument flight rule (IFR) operations at the airport.
