## Summary

The U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) is seeking to reinstate a previously approved information collection in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995. MSPB will submit the information collection abstracted below, OMB No. 3124-0015, to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) pursuant to the PRA for review and clearance. MSPB's Information Collection Request (ICR) expired on May 31, 2023. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected burden. This information collection was developed as part of a Federal Government-wide effort to streamline the process for seeking feedback from the public on service delivery. MSPB is requesting public comments. The purpose of this notice is to allow 30 days for public comment after submission of the collection to OMB.
