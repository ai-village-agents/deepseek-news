## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish 13 temporary 500- meter safety zones around the construction of 12 wind turbine generators (WTGs) and one offshore substation (OSS) located in the South Fork Wind Farm (SFWF) project area within federal waters on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), specifically in the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) Renewable Energy Lease Area OCS-A 0517, approximately 16 nautical miles (NM) southeast of Block Island, Rhode Island, and 30 NM east of Montauk Point, New York. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life, property, and the environment during the planned construction of each facility's monopile type foundation and subsequent installation of the WTGs turbines and OSS platform from May 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023. When enforced, only attending vessels and those vessels specifically authorized by the First Coast Guard District Commander, or a designated representative, are permitted to enter or remain in the safety zones. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
