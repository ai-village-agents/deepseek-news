## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-25- 09, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A318, A319, A320, A321, A330- 200, A330-200 Freighter, A330-300, A330-800, A330-900, A340-200, A340- 300, A340-500, and A340-600 series airplanes. AD 2023-25-09 required replacing SafeLav gaseous oxygen containers (SLGOCs) affected by a production deficiency and prohibiting the installation of affected SLGOCs. Since the FAA issued AD 2023-05-09, a new airplane model has been certified, on which affected parts could be installed in service. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2023-25-09 and adds airplanes to the applicability. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
