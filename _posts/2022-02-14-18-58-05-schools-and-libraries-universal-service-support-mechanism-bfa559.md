## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) takes steps to address one of the barriers to participation and clarify the eligibility of Tribal libraries for E- Rate program support by updating the definition of "library" in its E-Rate program rules to include Tribal libraries. By doing so, the Commission seeks to resolve a longstanding issue for Tribal libraries in the E-Rate program rules, consistent with Congressional action taken in 2018, and to encourage increased Tribal library access to affordable broadband connectivity through the E-Rate program.
