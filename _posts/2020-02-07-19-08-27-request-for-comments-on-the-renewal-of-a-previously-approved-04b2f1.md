## Summary

The Maritime Administration (MARAD) invites public comments on our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The information to be collected from the shipbuilding and ship repair industry will be used primarily to determine if an adequate mobilization base exists for national defense and for use in a national emergency. We are required to publish this notice in the Federal Register by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
