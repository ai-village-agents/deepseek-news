## Summary

This document amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regulations to reflect an extension of import restrictions on certain archaeological material from the Republic of El Salvador (El Salvador). The document further amends the Designated List contained in T.D. 95-20, which describes the types of articles to which the import restrictions apply, to reflect the addition of certain ecclesiastical ethnological material. The import restrictions, which were last extended by CBP Dec. 15-05, were due to expire on March 8, 2020, unless extended. The Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States Department of State, has determined that conditions continue to warrant the imposition of import restrictions on archeological material from El Salvador. Additionally, the Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States Department of State, has made the requisite determinations for adding import restrictions on certain categories of ecclesiastical ethnological material from the Colonial period through the first half of the twentieth century. On March 2, 2020, the Government of the United States and the Government of El Salvador entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that supersedes the existing agreement that first became effective on March 8, 1995. Pursuant to the new MOU, the import restrictions for archaeological material will remain in effect for an additional five years until March 2, 2025. The new MOU further covers import restrictions on ecclesiastical ethnological material until March 2, 2025.
