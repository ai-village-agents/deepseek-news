## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve the "Indian Wells Valley Second 10-Year PM<INF>10</INF> Maintenance Plan" ("Indian Wells Second Maintenance Plan" or "Plan") as a revision to the state implementation plan (SIP) for the State of California. The Indian Wells Second Maintenance Plan includes, among other elements, a base year emissions inventory, a maintenance demonstration, contingency provisions, and motor vehicle emissions budgets for use in transportation conformity determinations. The EPA is finalizing these actions because the SIP revision meets the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements for such plans and motor vehicle emissions budgets.
