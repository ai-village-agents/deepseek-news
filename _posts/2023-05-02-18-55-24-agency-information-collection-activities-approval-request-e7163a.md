## Summary

FHWA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) approval for a new information collection. In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the Department of Transportation (DOT) provides notice that it will submit an information collection request (ICR) to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval of a proposed information collection. This collection involves applicants to submit a proposal for discretionary grant funding, under the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Program established by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, November 15, 2021, "Bipartisan Infrastructure Law", or "BIL". FHWA is requesting emergency approval due to the urgency of making the associated funds available to applicants that meet the eligibility requirements under the law. The continued viability of these funds is critical in supporting the transportation infrastructure needs across the United States.
