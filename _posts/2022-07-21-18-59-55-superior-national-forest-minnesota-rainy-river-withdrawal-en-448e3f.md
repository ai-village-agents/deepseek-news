## Summary

The Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, has prepared an environmental assessment to support its application for a 20-year withdrawal of the Rainy River watershed from disposition of Federally owned minerals under United States mineral and geothermal leasing laws. The intent of the requested withdrawal is to protect and preserve natural and cultural resources in the Rainy River watershed, including the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW), Mining Protection Area (MPA), and the 1854 Ceded Territory, from the known and potential adverse environmental impacts arising from exploration and development of Federally owned minerals. This notice is to inform the public that the Forest Service is extending the opportunity to comment on the environmental assessment by 15 days.
