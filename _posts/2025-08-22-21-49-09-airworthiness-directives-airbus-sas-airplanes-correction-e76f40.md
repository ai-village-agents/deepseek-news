## Summary

The FAA is correcting an airworthiness directive (AD) that was published in the Federal Register. That AD applies to all Airbus SAS Model A319-151N, -153N, -171N, and -173N airplanes; Model A320-251N, - 252N, -253N, -271N, -272N, and -273N airplanes; and Model A321-251N, - 252N, -253N, -271N, -272N, -251NX, -252NX, -253NX, -271NX, -272NX, - 253NY, and -271NY airplanes. As published, a reference to a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD specified in the regulatory text is incorrect. This document corrects that error. In all other respects, the original document remains the same.
