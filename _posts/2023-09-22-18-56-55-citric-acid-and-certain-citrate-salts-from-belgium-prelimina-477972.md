## Summary

On June 1, 2023, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) initiated a sunset review of the antidumping duty (AD) order on citric acid and certain citrate salts (citric acid) from Belgium pursuant to section 751(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). Commerce determined that it was appropriate to conduct a full review. Commerce preliminarily finds that revocation of this AD order would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping at the levels indicated in the "Preliminary Results of Review" section of this notice.
