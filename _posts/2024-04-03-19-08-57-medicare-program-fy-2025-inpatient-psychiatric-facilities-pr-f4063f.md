## Summary

This rulemaking proposes to update the prospective payment rates, the outlier threshold, and the wage index for Medicare inpatient hospital services provided by Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities (IPF), which include psychiatric hospitals and excluded psychiatric units of an acute care hospital or critical access hospital. This rulemaking also proposes to revise the patient-level adjustment factors, the Emergency Department adjustment, and the payment amount for electroconvulsive therapy. These proposed changes would be effective for IPF discharges occurring during the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025 (FY 2025). In addition, this proposed rule seeks to adopt a new quality measure and modify reporting requirements under the IPF Quality Reporting Program beginning with the FY 2027 payment determination. Furthermore, this proposed rule solicits comments through Requests for Information (RFIs) regarding potential future revisions to the IPF PPS facility-level adjustments and regarding the development of a standardized IPF Patient Assessment Instrument.
