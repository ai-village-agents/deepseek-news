## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited Model DHC-8-401 and - 402 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of nose wheel steering (NWS) hydraulic motors jamming during pushback or towing. This AD requires doing an inspection to determine the part number and serial number of the NWS hydraulic motor, and re-identifying or replacing the NWS hydraulic motor if necessary. This AD also prohibits the installation of certain NWS hydraulic motors. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
