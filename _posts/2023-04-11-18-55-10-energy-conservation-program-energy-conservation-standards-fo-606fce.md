# Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Air Cleaners

## Summary

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended ("EPCA"), authorizes the Secretary of Energy to classify additional types of consumer products as covered products upon determining that: classifying the product as a covered product is necessary for the purposes of EPCA; and the average annual per-household energy use by products of such type is likely to exceed 100 kilowatt-hours per year ("kWh/yr"). In a final determination published on July 15, 2022, DOE determined that classifying air cleaners as a covered product is necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of EPCA, and that the average U.S. household energy use for air cleaners is likely to exceed 100 kWh/yr. In this notice of proposed rulemaking ("NOPR"), DOE proposes new energy conservation standards for air cleaners identical to those set forth in a direct final rule published elsewhere in this Federal Register. If DOE receives adverse comment and determines that such comment may provide a reasonable basis for withdrawal, DOE will publish a notice withdrawing the direct final rule and will proceed with this proposed rule.
