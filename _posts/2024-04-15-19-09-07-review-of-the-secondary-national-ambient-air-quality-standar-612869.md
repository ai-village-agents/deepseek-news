## Summary

Based on the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) review of the air quality criteria and national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for oxides of nitrogen (N oxides), oxides of sulfur (SO<INF>X</INF>), and particulate matter (PM), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to revise the existing secondary sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) standard to an annual average, averaged over three consecutive years, with a level within the range from 10 to 15 parts per billion (ppb). Additionally, the Agency proposes to retain the existing secondary standards for N oxides and PM, without revision. The EPA also proposes revisions to the data handling requirements for the proposed secondary SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS.
