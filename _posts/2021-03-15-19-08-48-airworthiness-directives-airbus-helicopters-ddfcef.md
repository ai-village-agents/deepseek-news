## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model EC225LP helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of an oil leak from the main gearbox (MGB) during engine start up. This proposed AD would require modification and subsequent repetitive functional testing of the MGB emergency lubrication (EMLUB) system as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
