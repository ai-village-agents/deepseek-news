## Summary

In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995, this notice announces that the Information Collection Request (ICR) abstracted below has been forwarded to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for emergency approval of a proposed information collection. DOT requests that OMB authorize this collection of information on or before May 14, 2022. Upon receiving the requested six-month emergency approval by OMB, DOT will follow the normal PRA procedures to obtain extended approval for this proposed information collection. The purpose of this collection is to enable eligible municipality and community-owned utilities (not including for-profit entities) to apply for grant assistance under the heading "Department of Transportation--Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration--Natural Gas Distribution Infrastructure Safety and Modernization Grant Program" in Public Law 117-58. DOT is requesting emergency approval due to the urgency of making the associated funds available to the municipality and community-owned utilities that meet the eligibility requirements under the law.
