## Summary

The Board is inviting comment on a proposed rule that would modify the requirements to file Suspicious Activity Reports for state member banks, Edge and agreement corporations, U.S. offices of foreign banking organizations supervised by the Federal Reserve, and bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries. Specifically, the proposed rule would amend the Board's Suspicious Activity Report regulations to provide for the issuance of exemptions from the requirements of those regulations, in full or in part. The proposed rule is intended, among other things, to facilitate supervised institutions in meeting Bank Secrecy Act requirements more efficiently and effectively, including through development of innovative solutions.
