## Summary

This rule modifies regulations to add the Omega net mesh measurement gauge as a permissible device for net mesh measurement and to correct regulatory references to gear restrictions. This action is required to allow the use of the Omega gauge as a method for measuring and enforcing net mesh size. Adoption of the Omega gauge, a handheld electronic device, is intended to improve the efficiency, safety, and cost-effectiveness of at-sea net mesh enforcement.
