## Summary

The U.S. Department of Transportation's (U.S. DOT) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology (OST-R) is seeking information from the public, industry, infrastructure owner/operators, and other stakeholders to inform coordinated national research supporting Automated Driving Systems (ADS) transportation technology deployment and realizing safe efficient operations on our Nation's roadways. ADS-equipped vehicles have significant potential to transform safety and mobility but in order for national deployment to scale effectively, research questions relating to the challenges and opportunities of ADS, including understanding disengagements, identifying factors that contribute or detract from reliable and consistent operations and interactions, and facilitating interoperable data standardization and real-time analytics, among others, are important to investigate further to support deployment and broad public acceptance.
