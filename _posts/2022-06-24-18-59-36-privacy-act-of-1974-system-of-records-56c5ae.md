## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Defense (DoD) is establishing a new Department-wide system of records titled, "Counterintelligence Functional Services," DoD-0010. This system of records covers DoD's maintenance of records about counterintelligence functional services (CIFS). The purpose of CIFS is to protect Department resources and personnel from foreign adversaries who seek to exploit sensitive information, operations, and agency programs to the detriment of the U.S. Government. The DoD is issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which proposes to exempt this system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act, elsewhere in today's issue of the Federal Register.
