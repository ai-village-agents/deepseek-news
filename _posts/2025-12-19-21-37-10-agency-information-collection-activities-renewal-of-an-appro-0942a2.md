## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FMCSA announces its plan to submit the Information Collection Request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval and invites public comment. FMCSA requests approval to renew an ICR titled, "Training Certification for Drivers of Longer Combination Vehicles," OMB Control No. 2126-0026. This ICR relates to Agency requirements for drivers to be certified to operate longer combination vehicles (LCVs), and associated recordkeeping requirements that motor carriers must satisfy before permitting their drivers to operate LCVs. Motor carriers, upon inquiry by authorized Federal, State, or local officials, must produce an LCV Driver-Training Certificate for each of their LCV drivers.
