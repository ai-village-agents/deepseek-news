## Summary

The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA or the Agency) is requiring that mine operators develop, implement, and update, periodically or when necessary, a written safety program for surface mobile equipment (excluding belt conveyors) at surface mines and surface areas of underground mines. The written safety program must be developed and updated with input from miners and their representatives. The written safety program must include actions mine operators will take to identify hazards and risks to reduce accidents, injuries, and fatalities related to surface mobile equipment. The final rule offers mine operators flexibility to devise a safety program that is appropriate for their specific mining conditions and operations.
