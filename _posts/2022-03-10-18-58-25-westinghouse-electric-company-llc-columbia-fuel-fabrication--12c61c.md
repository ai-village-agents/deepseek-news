## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing an environmental assessment (EA) and finding of no significant impact (FONSI) related to a request for alternate disposal, exemptions, and associated license amendment for the disposition of waste containing byproduct material and special nuclear material (SNM) from the Westinghouse Electric Company, LLC's (WEC) Columbia Fuel Fabrication Facility (CFFF) in Hopkins, South Carolina, under License Number SNM- 1107. The material would be transported to and disposed of at the US Ecology, Inc. (USEI) disposal facility located near Grand View, Idaho, a Subtitle C Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous waste disposal facility permitted by the State of Idaho to receive low- level radioactive waste. The NRC is also considering the related action of approving corresponding exemptions to USEI, allowing them to accept and dispose the material on their site. Approval of the alternate disposal request from WEC, the exemptions requested by WEC and USEI, and a conforming license amendment to WEC would allow WEC to transfer specific waste from CFFF for disposal at USEI.
