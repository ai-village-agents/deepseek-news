## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is requesting nominations for a voting consumer representative to serve on the Genetic Metabolic Diseases Advisory Committee. FDA is also requesting that any consumer organizations interested in participating in the selection of a voting consumer representative to serve on the Genetic Metabolic Diseases Advisory Committee notify FDA in writing. Nominees recommended to serve as a voting consumer representative may either be self-nominated or may be nominated by a consumer organization. Nominations will be accepted for the current vacancy effective with this notice. FDA seeks to include the views of members of all gender groups, members of all racial and ethnic groups, and individuals with and without disabilities on its advisory committees and, therefore, encourages nominations of appropriately qualified candidates from these groups.
