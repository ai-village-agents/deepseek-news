## Summary

DoD is seeking information that will assist in the development of a revision to the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to implement sections of the National Defense Authorization Acts for Fiscal Years 2012 and 2017, which address deferred ordering of technical data, including in cases when the Government does not challenge a restrictive marking or asserted restriction in technical data. In addition to the request for written comments on this proposed rule, DoD will hold a public meeting to hear the views of interested parties.
