## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) RB211 Trent 768-60, RB211 Trent 772-60, and RB211 Trent 772B-60 model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by maintenance that resulted in damage to certain low-pressure compressor (LPC) blades, resulting in increased susceptibility to cracking in the LPC blade root. This AD requires initial and repetitive inspections of the blade root of certain LPC blades and re-lubrication of the LPC blades and LPC disk. Depending on the results of the inspections, this AD requires replacement of the LPC blades. As a terminating action to the inspection and re-lubrication requirements, this AD requires restoration of the LPC blade as well as examination and re-lubrication of the LPC disk. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
