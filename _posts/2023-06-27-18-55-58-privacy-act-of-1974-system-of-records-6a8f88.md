## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to modify and reissue a current DHS system of records titled, "DHS/U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)-022 Electronic Visa Update System (EVUS) System of Records." EVUS is an online enrollment system that enables DHS/CBP to collect updated information from certain nonimmigrant visa holders over the length of the visa period that would otherwise not be obtained prior to travel to the United States. DHS/CBP collects this information to determine whether applicants pose a security risk to the United States over the duration of the visa. DHS/CBP is updating this system of records to expand the category of records included in the system. The exemptions for the existing system of records notice will continue to be applicable for this updated system of records notice. This modified system of records notice will be included in the DHS inventory of record systems.
