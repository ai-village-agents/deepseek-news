# Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 777 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of cracks found in the station (STA) 2370 pivot bulkhead forward outer chord. Analysis revealed higher bending stresses across the chord than originally assessed. This proposed AD would require repetitive detailed and high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections of the STA 2370 pivot bulkhead forward outer chord and longeron fitting for cracking and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
