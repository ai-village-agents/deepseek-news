## Summary

NMFS publishes for public review and comment information regarding a permit application for transshipment of farmed salmon from aquaculture operations in Maine waters to processing plants in Canada by Canadian flagged vessels. NMFS approved permits in January 2022 for four vessels for the entity requesting the permit, True North Salmon Limited Partnership and 697002 NB, Inc. The recent application is for one additional vessel to perform the same functions as the four previously permitted vessels. The application for a transshipment permit is submitted under provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act). This action is necessary for NMFS to make a determination that the permit application can be approved.
