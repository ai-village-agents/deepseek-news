## Summary

As required by the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act of 2020, the Federal Trade Commission publishes a proposed modification of the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority's rules addressing horseracing in the United States. The proposed rule modification would amend the Rule 8000 Series, the Enforcement Rule, which establishes specified violations, sanctions applicable to violations of rules in both the Rule 2000 and Rule 8000 Series, a comprehensive set of procedures for the adjudication of alleged violations, and rules applicable to the exercise of the Authority's investigatory powers. This document publicizes the Authority's proposed rule modification's text and explanation, and it seeks public comment on whether the Commission should approve the proposed rule modification.
