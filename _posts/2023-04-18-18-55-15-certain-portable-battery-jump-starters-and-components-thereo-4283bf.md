## Summary

Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on February 13, 2023, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of The NOCO Company of Glenwillow, Ohio. An amended complaint was filed March 13, 2023. The amended complaint alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain portable battery jump starters and components thereof by reason of the infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 9,770,992 ("the '992 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 10,328,808 ("the '808 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 10,981,452 ("the '452 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 11,254,213 ("the '213 patent"); and U.S. Patent No. 11,447,023 ("the '023 patent"). The amended complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The amended complaint also alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, or in the sale of certain portable battery jump starters and components thereof by reason of common law trade dress infringement and false designation of origin, and false advertising and unfair competition, the threat or effect of which is to destroy or substantially injure an industry in the United States. The complainant requests that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a limited exclusion order and cease and desist orders.
