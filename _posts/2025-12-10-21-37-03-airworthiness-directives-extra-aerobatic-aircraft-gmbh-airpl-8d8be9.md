## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Extra Aerobatic Aircraft GmbH (Extra) Model EXTRA NG airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of the canopy opening or detaching in flight because of a partially or improperly locked canopy. This proposed AD would require replacing the canopy placards and revising the Limitations Section of the Pilot Operating Handbook/ Airplane Flight Manual (POH/AFM). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
