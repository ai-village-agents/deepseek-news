## Summary

The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is publishing a final rule that requires Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the Enterprises) to develop plans to facilitate their rapid and orderly resolution in the event FHFA is appointed receiver. A resolution planning rule is an important part of FHFA's ongoing effort to develop a robust prudential regulatory framework for the Enterprises, including capital, liquidity, and stress testing requirements, as well as enhanced supervision, which will be critical to FHFA's supervision of the Enterprises particularly in the event of an exit from conservatorship. Requiring the Enterprises to develop resolution plans would support FHFA's efforts as receiver for the Enterprises to, among other things, minimize disruption in the national housing finance markets by providing for the continued operation of an Enterprise's core business lines (CBLs) by a limited- life regulated entity (LLRE); ensure that private-sector investors in Enterprise securities, including Enterprise debt, stand to bear losses in accordance with the statutory priority of payments while minimizing unnecessary losses and costs to these investors. In addition, resolution planning will help foster market discipline in part through FHFA publication of "public" sections of Enterprise resolution plans.
