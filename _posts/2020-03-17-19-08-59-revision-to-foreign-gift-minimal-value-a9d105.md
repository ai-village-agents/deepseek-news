## Summary

GSA, in consultation with the U.S. Department of State, must redefine the minimal value of foreign gift items to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the preceding 3-year period, as specified under the law concerning the Receipt and Disposition of Foreign Gifts and Decorations. The minimal value was last defined effective January 1, 2017, and must be redefined effective as of January 1, 2020. This bulletin cancels FMR Bulletin B-41, "Foreign Gift and Decoration Minimal Value," issued January 12, 2017, as this bulletin provides updated information on the same topic.
