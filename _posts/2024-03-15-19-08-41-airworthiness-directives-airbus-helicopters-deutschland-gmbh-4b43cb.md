## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (AHD) Model EC135P1, EC135P2, EC135P2+, EC135P3, EC135T1, EC135T2, EC135T2+, EC135T3, MBB-BK 117 C-2, MBB-BK 117 D-2, and MBB-BK 117 D-3 helicopters. This AD was prompted by the determination that Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) screens obstruct the pilot's view. This AD requires removing certain part-numbered IFR screens, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
