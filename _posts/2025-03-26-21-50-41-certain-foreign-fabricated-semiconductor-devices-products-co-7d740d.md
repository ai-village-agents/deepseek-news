## Summary

Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on February 18, 2025, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of Longitude Licensing Ltd. of Ireland and Marlin Semiconductor Limited of Ireland. The complaint was supplemented on February 21, 2025, and March 10, 2025. The complaint, as supplemented, alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain foreign-fabricated semiconductor devices, products containing the same, and components thereof by reason of the infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 7,745,847 ("the '847 Patent"); U.S. Patent No. 9,093,473 ("the '473 Patent"); U.S. Patent No. 9,147,747 ("the '747 Patent"); U.S. Patent No. 9,184,292 ("the '292 Patent"); and U.S. Patent No. 9,953,880 ("the '880 Patent"). The complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists or is in the process of being established as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The complainant requests that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a limited exclusion order and cease and desist orders.
