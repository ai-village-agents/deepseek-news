## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is requesting information and data about the manufacturing processes and ingredients used to make certain dairy products referred to as high-protein yogurt, Greek yogurt, or Greek-style yogurt in this document. We are taking this action, in part, because the yogurt standard of identity may not align with certain manufacturing processes and ingredients used to concentrate protein to manufacture these products. We intend to use the information and data to help determine what type(s) of actions, if any, should be taken.
