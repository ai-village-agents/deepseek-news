## Summary

This notice announces that the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) is suspending certain regulatory requirements for F-1 nonimmigrant students who are Hong Kong residents, regardless of country of birth, and who are experiencing severe economic hardship as a direct result of the current crisis in Hong Kong. The Secretary is taking action to provide relief to those Hong Kong residents who were in lawful F-1 nonimmigrant student status as of January 26, 2023, so the students may request employment authorization, work an increased number of hours while school is in session, and reduce their course load while continuing to maintain their F-1 nonimmigrant student status. DHS will deem an F-1 nonimmigrant student who receives employment authorization by means of this notice to be engaged in a "full course of study" for the duration of the employment authorization, if the nonimmigrant student satisfies the minimum course load requirement described in this notice.
