## Summary

NMFS is issuing regulations to implement management measures in three new fishery management plans (FMPs), as prepared and submitted by the Caribbean Fishery Management Council (Council). This final rule replaces regulations implementing the U.S. Caribbean region-wide FMPs with regulations implementing the approved island-based FMPs. The purpose of the island-based FMPs is to update management of Federal fisheries in the U.S. Caribbean. NMFS expects these management measures will better account for differences among the U.S. Caribbean islands with respect to culture, markets, fishing gear used, seafood preferences, and ecological impacts.
