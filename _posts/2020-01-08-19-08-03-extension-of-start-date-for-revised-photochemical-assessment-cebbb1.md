## Summary

The EPA is delaying the start date for the revised Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) monitoring site network established in EPA regulations. This final action extends the start date from June 1, 2019, to June 1, 2021. The revision gives states two additional years to acquire the necessary equipment and expertise needed to successfully make the required PAMS measurements by the start of the 2021 PAMS season.
