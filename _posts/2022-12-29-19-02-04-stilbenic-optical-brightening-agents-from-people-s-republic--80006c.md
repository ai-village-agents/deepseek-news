## Summary

On October 3, 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) initiated the sunset reviews of the antidumping duty (AD) orders on stilbenic optical brightening agents (OBAs) from the People's Republic of China (China) and Taiwan. Because no domestic interested party responded to the sunset review notice of initiation by the applicable deadline, consistent with section 751(c)(3)(A) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), Commerce is revoking these AD orders.
