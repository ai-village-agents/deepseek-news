## Summary

This action amends the Class D and Class E airspace and removes Class E airspace at Kalamazoo, MI. This action is the result of an airspace review caused by the decommissioning of the Kalamazoo very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimum Operating Network (MON) Program. The geographic coordinates of Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport and the name of the Borgess Medical Center Helipad are also being updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
