## Summary

The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) publishes its final List of Fisheries (LOF) for 2023, as required by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). The LOF for 2023 reflects new information on interactions between commercial fisheries and marine mammals. NMFS must classify each commercial fishery on the LOF into one of three categories under the MMPA based upon the level of mortality and serious injury of marine mammals that occurs incidental to each fishery. The classification of a fishery on the LOF determines whether participants in that fishery are subject to certain provisions of the MMPA, such as registration, observer coverage, and take reduction plan (TRP) requirements.
