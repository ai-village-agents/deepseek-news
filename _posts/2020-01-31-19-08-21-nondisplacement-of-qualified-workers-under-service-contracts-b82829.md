## Summary

On October 31, 2019, President Trump issued an Executive order on improving Federal contractor operations, which revoked an Executive order concerning nondisplacement of qualified workers under Federal service contracts, and directed the Secretary of Labor to promptly rescind the regulations and policies implementing the revoked Executive order. The directive also ordered the termination of all investigations or compliance actions based on the revoked Executive order. In accordance with this directive, the Department of Labor is issuing a final rule to rescind the regulations on nondisplacement of qualified workers under service contracts, which were promulgated pursuant to the authority provided by the revoked Executive order.
