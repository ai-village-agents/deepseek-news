## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-1A10 and BD-700-1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that a certain nondestructive test (NDT) procedure associated with a certain airworthiness limitation for inspecting the inboard, mid, and outboard flap metallic end ribs does not contain all of the necessary instructions. This AD requires a revision to the existing maintenance or inspection program to require using a revised NDT procedure when performing an airworthiness limitation task. This AD also prohibits the use of earlier revisions of that NDT procedure. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
