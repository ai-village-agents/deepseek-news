## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) have determined that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on coated paper suitable for high-quality print graphics using sheet-fed presses (coated paper) from Indonesia and the People's Republic of China (China) would likely lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury to an industry in the United States within a reasonably foreseeable time. Therefore, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation of these AD and CVD orders.
