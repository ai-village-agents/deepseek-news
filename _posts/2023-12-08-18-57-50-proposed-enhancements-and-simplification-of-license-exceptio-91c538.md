## Summary

In this rulemaking, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) proposes revising License Exception Strategic Trade Authorization (STA) under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). The purpose of these changes is to encourage additional use of License Exception STA for ally and partner countries. BIS proposes specific revisions to License Exception STA and includes questions for public comment to help BIS better understand impediments in using License Exception STA. This proposed rule is part of a broader effort announced today that will revise several categories of export licensing requirements and the availability of export license exceptions for key allied and partner countries, as well as for members of certain multilateral export control regimes.
