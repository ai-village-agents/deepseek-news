## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain General Electric Company (GE) CF34-8C and CF34-8E model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by a report of a crack found on the low-pressure turbine (LPT) stage 5 disk at the forward arm area. This AD requires the removal of the affected LPT stage 5 disk and replacement with a part eligible for installation. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
