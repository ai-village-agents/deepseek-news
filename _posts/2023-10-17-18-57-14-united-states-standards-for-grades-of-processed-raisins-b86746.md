## Summary

The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) has revised the U.S. Standards for Grades of Processed Raisins. AMS is modifying two references to the allowances for capstems within the standards to modernize the standards to reflect current industry practices. The revision also includes minor editorial changes to the table headings to align with updated Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) formatting requirements and correction of a typographical error from a previous revision.
