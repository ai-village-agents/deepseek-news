## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain MHI RJ Aviation ULC Model CL-600-2D15 (Regional Jet Series 705) and CL-600-2D24 (Regional Jet Series 900) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a notice from a supplier reporting that torque wrenches used to install the air driven generator (ADG) downlock cam nut were out of calibration, which resulted in a higher torque level setting than required during the initial production installation of the affected cam nut. This proposed AD would require replacement of the affected ADG locking cam screw and cam nut, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
