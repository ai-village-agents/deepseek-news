## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes to amend its rules on VA-backed interest rate reduction refinancing loans (IRRRLs). The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act and the Protecting Affordable Mortgages for Veterans Act of 2019 outlined the circumstances in which VA may guarantee or insure refinance loans, by setting forth net tangible benefit, recoupment, and seasoning standards. The proposed rule would update VA's existing IRRRL regulation to current statutory requirements.
