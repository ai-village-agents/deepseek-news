## Summary

This DFR revises the property damage threshold for determining when a release from a gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facility meets the definition of a reportable incident or accident. This change clarifies that certain indirect impacts associated with investigating and repairing a release do not contribute to that threshold. This DFR also adopts an inflation adjusted property damage threshold for reporting hazardous liquid pipeline accidents identical to the one previously adopted for reporting gas pipeline incidents.
