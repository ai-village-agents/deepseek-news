# Vessel Repair Duties for Vessels Entering U.S. Ports; Correction

## Summary

On July 29, 2022, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) published a Final Rule in the Federal Register that streamlines the vessel repair entry process by extending the timeframe for vessel operators to provide completed vessel repair entries and to apply for relief from assessment of duties associated with vessel repairs occurring abroad. The rule now extends the timeframe from 90 days to 150 days and eliminates the need for filing extension requests. That document inadvertently deleted the list of evidence required in Applications for Relief from the assessment of vessel repair duties. CBP is correcting that error by restoring the list of required documentation in the regulations.
