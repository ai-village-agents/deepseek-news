## Summary

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is adopting a final rule to rescind and remove rules regarding accounting requirements for State savings associations because these financial statement and disclosure requirements are substantially similar to, although more detailed than, otherwise applicable financial statement form and content requirements and disclosure requirements that a State savings association must satisfy under Federal banking or securities laws or regulations. The final rule adopts, without change, a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) published in the Federal Register on October 2, 2019, which received no comments.
