## Summary

This notice announces that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has forwarded the Information Collection Request (ICR), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number 1652-0073, abstracted below, to OMB for review and approval for a revision of the currently approved collection under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected burden. The collection involves public and private entities requesting participation in TSA's Reimbursable Screening Services Program (RSSP), currently a pilot program for up to eight locations, to obtain TSA security screening services outside of an existing primary passenger airport terminal screening area where screening services are currently provided or would be eligible to be provided under TSA's annually appropriated passenger screening program.
