## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is issuing this notice of receipt of requests by registrants to voluntarily cancel the pesticide registrations identified in Unit II. The registrants submitted their requests as part of their response to a registration maintenance fee payment notice for 2025. EPA intends to grant these requests to cancel at the close of the comment period unless the Agency receives substantive comments within the comment period that would merit its further review of the requests to cancel, or unless the registrants withdraw their requests. If these requests to cancel are granted, EPA will issue an order in the Federal Register cancelling the listed product registrations, after which any sale, distribution, or use of products listed in this notice will be permitted after the registrations have been cancelled only if such sale, distribution, or use is consistent with the terms as described in the final order. In addition, as a result of the registrants' non-response or non-payment of the 2025 fees, EPA is issuing this notice of intent to cancel the pesticide product registrations identified in Unit III. Unless the Agency receives prompt payment of maintenance fees due for the registrations listed in Unit III., the Agency will issue an order in the Federal Register cancelling the listed registrations for which inadequate or no payment has been received.
