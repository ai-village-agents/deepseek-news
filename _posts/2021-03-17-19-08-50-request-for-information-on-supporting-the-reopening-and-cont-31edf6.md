## Summary

Consistent with the President's Executive order titled "Supporting the Reopening and Continuing Operation of Schools and Early Childhood Education Providers," the U.S. Department of Education (Department) is requesting information to enable teachers, faculty, staff, schools, districts, institutions of higher education (IHEs), early childhood education providers, other places of educational instruction, and States to share lessons learned and best practices for operating safely and supporting all children and students, including children and students with disabilities, English learners, racial and ethnic minorities, and other underserved children and students, teachers, faculty, and staff during the pandemic. We will consider this information when populating a Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse. Responding to the request for information or undertaking any of the lessons learned included in the Clearinghouse are completely voluntary activities and are not prerequisites to receipt of any Federal funding.
