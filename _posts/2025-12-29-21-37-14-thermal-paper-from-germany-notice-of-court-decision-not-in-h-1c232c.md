## Summary

On November 20, 2025, the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) issued its final judgment in Matra Americas, LLC et al v. United States, Slip Op. 25-145, Consol. Court No. 21-00632, sustaining the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce)'s final remand redetermination pertaining to the antidumping duty (AD) investigation of thermal paper from Germany covering the period of investigation October 1, 2019, through September 30, 2020.
