## Summary

This document contains proposed regulations relating to the use of actuarial tables in valuing annuities, interests for life or a term of years, and remainder or reversionary interests. These regulations will affect the valuation of inter vivos and testamentary transfers of interests dependent on one or more measuring lives. These regulations are necessary because applicable law requires the actuarial tables to be updated to reflect the most recent mortality experience available.
