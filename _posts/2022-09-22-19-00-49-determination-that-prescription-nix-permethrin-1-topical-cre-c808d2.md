## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, Agency, or we) has determined that prescription NIX (permethrin) 1% topical creme rinse was not withdrawn from sale for reasons of safety or effectiveness. However, because NIX (permethrin) 1% topical creme rinse has been approved for nonprescription use, NIX and any generic product referencing prescription NIX would be misbranded under FDA regulations if marketed with the "Rx only" symbol. Moreover, FDA will not approve abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) referencing prescription NIX (permethrin) 1% topical creme rinse.
