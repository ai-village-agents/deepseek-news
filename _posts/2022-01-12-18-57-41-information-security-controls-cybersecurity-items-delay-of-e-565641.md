## Summary

On October 21, 2021, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) published an interim final rule that establishes new controls on certain cybersecurity items for National Security (NS) and Anti- terrorism (AT) reasons, along with a new License Exception, Authorized Cybersecurity Exports (ACE), that authorizes exports of these items to most destinations except in the circumstances described in that rule. That rule was published with a 45-day comment period, which ended on December 12, 2021, and a 90-day delayed effective date (January 19, 2022). This rule delays the effective date of the interim final rule by 45 days.
