## Summary

The Environmental Protection (EPA) is taking direct final action to approve revisions to the site-specific Research, Development and Demonstration rule for the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community (SRPMIC), Salt River Landfill Research, Development, and Demonstration Project in order to increase the maximum term for the site-specific rule from 12 to 21 years. EPA is also revising the site- specific rule to reflect a change in the division title for U.S. EPA Region 9, from the Waste Management Division to the Land, Chemicals and Redevelopment Division.
