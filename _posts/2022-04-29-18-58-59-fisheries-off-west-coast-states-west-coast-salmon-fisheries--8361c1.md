## Summary

NMFS is revising regulations that implement the Pacific Fishery Management Council's (Council) Pacific Coast Salmon Fishery Management Plan (FMP). This action removes a rebuilding plan for Sacramento River fall-run Chinook salmon (SRFC) from regulation, as this stock has been rebuilt and is no longer required to be managed under a rebuilding plan; and updates language to reflect the 2013 merger of NMFS' Northwest Region (NWR) and Southwest Region (SWR), which created NMFS' West Coast Region (WCR).
