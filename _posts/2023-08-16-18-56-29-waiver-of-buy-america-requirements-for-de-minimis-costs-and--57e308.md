## Summary

The Department of Transportation (DOT) seeks to maximize the use of American-made products and materials in all federally funded projects as part of the Biden-Harris Administration's implementation of the Build America, Buy America Act (BABA), which was included in the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). In this notice, DOT is taking action to finalize a limited waiver of Buy America requirements for de minimis costs and small grants. Based on public comments from stakeholders, this final waiver is narrower than what DOT had first proposed on November 4, 2022. The waiver will allow DOT and its assistance recipients to focus their domestic sourcing efforts on products that provide the greatest manufacturing opportunities for American workers and firms and reduce delays in the delivery of important transportation infrastructure projects that provide jobs and promote economic growth.
