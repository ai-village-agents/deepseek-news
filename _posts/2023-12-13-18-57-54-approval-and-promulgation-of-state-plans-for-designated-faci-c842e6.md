## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to partially approve and partially disapprove a Clean Air Act (CAA) State Plan submitted by the Spokane Regional Clean Air Agency (SRCAA). This State Plan establishes emission limits for existing large municipal waste combustors (MWC) and provides for the implementation and enforcement of these limits. SRCAA submitted this State Plan to fulfill its requirements under the CAA in response to the EPA's promulgation of Emissions Guidelines and Compliance Times for Large MWC Constructed on or before September 20, 1994 (Emission Guidelines). The EPA is partially approving the State Plan because it meets the requirements of the Emission Guidelines for existing large MWC known to operate in Spokane County, Washington. The EPA is partially disapproving the State Plan because it omits requirements for fluidized bed combustors and air curtain incinerators, which are required elements of a State Plan.
