## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (also, "the Agency "or "we" in this preamble) is taking final action to grant three petitions submitted jointly by Emerald Kalama Chemical, LLC (Emerald) and Fire Mountain Farms, Inc (FMF) (Petitioners), in Lewis County, Washington to exclude (or "delist") a one-time amount up to 20,100 cubic yards of U019 (benzene) and U220 (toluene) mixed material from the list of federal hazardous wastes as proposed on November 12, 2019. The EPA has decided to grant these petitions as proposed and under the same conditions based on an evaluation of waste-specific information provided by the Petitioners and a consideration of public comments received.
