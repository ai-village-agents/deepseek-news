## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing a limited approval and limited disapproval of revisions to the Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District (MDAQMD) portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). This revision concerns emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) from industrial, institutional, and commercial boilers, steam generators, and process heaters. We are proposing a limited approval of a local rule that regulates these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act) because the rule would strengthen the current SIP-approved version of MDAQMD's rule. We are proposing a limited disapproval of this revision because it is inconsistent with the EPA's startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) policy and Credible Evidence Rules. We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
