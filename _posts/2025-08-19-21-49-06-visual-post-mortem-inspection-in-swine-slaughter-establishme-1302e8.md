## Summary

FSIS is proposing to end mandatory mandibular lymph nodes incision and viscera palpation of swine carcasses in all swine slaughter establishments (i.e., establishments operating under traditional swine slaughter inspection or the New Swine Slaughter Inspection System (NSIS). Mandibular lymph nodes ("lymph nodes") incision and viscera palpation of swine carcasses are not needed to ensure food safety, as FSIS swine condemnation rates are low and disease conditions that are condemnable defects can be detected visually through other pathological changes in the carcass and its parts. Therefore, FSIS is proposing to amend the meat inspection regulations to remove requirements for establishment sorters to "incise mandibular lymph nodes and palpate the viscera" as part of their sorting activities before FSIS post-mortem inspection in NSIS establishments. FSIS is also proposing to amend the post-mortem swine inspection staffing standards table applicable to swine slaughter establishments operating under traditional inspection. This change would allow FSIS more flexibility to assign inspection program personnel (IPP) based on the establishment's line configuration, other establishment operations, and FSIS staffing needs.
