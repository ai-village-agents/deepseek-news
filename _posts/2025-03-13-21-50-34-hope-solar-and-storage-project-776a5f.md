## Summary

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) intends to prepare an environmental document for the purchase of electricity generated by the proposed Hope Solar and Storage Project in Clay County, Mississippi. The environmental review will assess the potential environmental effects of constructing, operating, and maintaining the proposed 200- megawatt (MW) alternating current (AC) solar photovoltaic (PV) facility and up to 200 MW Battery Energy Storage System (BESS). The proposed solar facility and BESS system would occupy a portion of the 2,427-acre Project Study Area. Public comments are invited concerning the scope of the review, alternatives being considered, and environmental issues that should be addressed as a part of this review. TVA is also requesting data, information, and analysis relevant to the proposed action from the public; affected federal, state, tribal, and local governments, agencies, and offices; the scientific community; industry; or any other interested party.
