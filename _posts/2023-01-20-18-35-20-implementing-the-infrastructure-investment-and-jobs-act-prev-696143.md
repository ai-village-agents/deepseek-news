## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission or FCC) seeks comment on potential rules to address digital discrimination of access to broadband internet access service. The document proposes to adopt a definition of "digital discrimination of access" as that term is used in section 60506 of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and seeks comment on further details of the definition, including its scope and the appropriate legal standard. The document proposes to revise the Commission's informal consumer complaint process to accept complaints of digital discrimination of access, and it proposes to adopt model policies and best practices for states and localities combating digital discrimination. The document also seeks comment on other rules the Commission should adopt to facilitate equal access and combat digital discrimination, and the legal authority for adopted rules.
