## Summary

DoD, GSA, and NASA are proposing to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to implement a proposed Governmentwide policy developed by the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP Administrator), pursuant to the Administrator's authority that would prohibit contractors and subcontractors from seeking and considering information about job applicants' compensation history when making employment decisions for certain positions. Under the proposed policy and the proposed regulatory amendments, contractors and subcontractors would also be required to disclose the compensation to be offered to the hired applicant in job announcements for certain positions.
