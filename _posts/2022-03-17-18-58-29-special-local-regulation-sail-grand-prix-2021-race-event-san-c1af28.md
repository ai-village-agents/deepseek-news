## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary special local regulation in the navigable waters of San Francisco Bay in San Francisco, CA, in support of the San Francisco Sail Grand Prix 2021 race periods on March 24, 2022, through March 27, 2022. This special local regulation is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters and to ensure the safety of mariners transiting the area from the dangers associated with high-speed sailing activities associate with the Sail Grand Prix 2021 race event. This rulemaking would temporarily prohibit persons and vessels from entering into, transiting through, anchoring, blocking, or loitering within the event area adjacent to the city of San Francisco waterfront near the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz Island, unless authorized by the Captain of the Port San Francisco or a designated representative.
