## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is confirming the effective date of January 8, 2026, for the direct final rule that was published in the Federal Register on December 3, 2025, except for one provision that is being withdrawn. This direct final rule amended the NRC's regulations to insert a conditional sunset date into certain regulations in response to Executive Order 14270, "Zero-Based Regulatory Budgeting to Unleash American Energy." The NRC is withdrawing an amendment that would have established a conditional sunset date to the NRC's provisions for aircraft impact assessment.
