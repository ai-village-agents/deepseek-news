## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all General Atomics AeroTec Systems GmbH (General Atomics) Model Dornier 228-100, Dornier 228-101, Dornier 228-200, Dornier 228-201, Dornier 228-202, and Dornier 228-212 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of specific part-numbered hydraulic pump motors becoming severely damaged by excessive heat. This proposed AD would require replacing the affected hydraulic pump motor with an improved design hydraulic pump motor. This proposed AD would also prohibit installing an affected hydraulic pump motor on any airplane. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
