## Summary

The Secretary amends the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations governing participation in the student financial assistance programs authorized under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), to promote program integrity and institutional quality. These regulations clarify, update, and consolidate certain provisions that apply to distance education and the return of title IV, HEA funds. They also make technical changes to the TRIO program regulations to reflect the current status of the Republic of Palau as a member of the Freely Associated States. This document provides notice that the Department fully closes out the Program Integrity and Institutional Quality: Distance Education and Return of Title IV, HEA Funds notice of proposed rulemaking. That is, we will not be finalizing the remainder of the Federal TRIO program provisions but may promulgate through future rulemaking efforts.
