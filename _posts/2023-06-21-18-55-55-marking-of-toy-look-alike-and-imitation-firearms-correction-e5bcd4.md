## Summary

The Federal Energy Management Improvement Act Update transferred authority for regulating the marking of toy, look-alike, and imitation firearms from the Department of Commerce to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. On May 11, 2023, the Commission issued a direct final rule to adopt the Department of Commerce rule for the marking of toy, look-alike, and imitation firearms, with non- substantive and conforming changes. That document contained a typographical error. This document corrects that error.
