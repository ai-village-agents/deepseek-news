## Summary

Ricon Corporation (Ricon), has determined that certain S- Series and K-Series Classic wheelchair lifts do not fully comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 403, Platform Lift Systems for Motor Vehicles. Because of Ricon's determination, Navistar, Inc., on behalf of IC Bus, LLC (Navistar), who installed the S-Series and K-Series Classic wheelchair lifts in their buses, determined that model year (MY) 2013-2019 IC buses do not comply with FMVSS No. 404, Platform Lift Installation in Motor Vehicles. Ricon and Navistar, collectively referred to as the "the petitioners," filed the appropriate noncompliance reports and subsequently petitioned NHTSA for a decision that the subject noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. This document announces receipt of the petitioner's petitions.
