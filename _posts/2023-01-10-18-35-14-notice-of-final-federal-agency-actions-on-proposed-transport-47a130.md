## Summary

The FHWA, on behalf of the FDOT, is issuing this notice to announce actions taken by FDOT and other Federal Agencies that are final agency actions. These actions relate to the proposed project along the Venetian Causeway which is approximately 2.5 miles long, and is primarily a two-lane undivided facility that provides a major link between the cities of Miami and Miami Beach in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The Causeway includes ten fixed span bridges and two bascule leaf span bridges over the Intracoastal Waterway (ICWW) extending from North Bayshore Drive (City of Miami) to Purdy Avenue (City of Miami Beach). The twelve bridges are numbered Bridge 1 to Bridge 12 from west to east. The proposed improvements replace the fixed spans of Bridges 2 through 12 with concrete arched beams and the bascule span at Bridge 10 with a double leaf bascule bridge to meet current design and safety requirements. The proposed typical section is 16-ft wider than the existing as a result of enhanced pedestrian and bicycle provisions, and consists of an 11-ft. lane, 7-ft. bicycle lane and 8-ft. sidewalk in each direction. The bascule span at Bridge 1 has already been replaced and is not included in the proposed improvements. These actions grant licenses, permits, or approvals for the project.
