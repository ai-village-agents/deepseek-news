## Summary

This document contains proposed regulations relating to the credit for production of clean hydrogen (clean hydrogen production credit) and the energy credit, as established and amended by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, respectively. The proposed regulations would provide rules for: determining lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions rates resulting from hydrogen production processes; petitioning for provisional emissions rates; verifying production and sale or use of clean hydrogen; modifying or retrofitting existing qualified clean hydrogen production facilities; using electricity from certain renewable or zero-emissions sources to produce qualified clean hydrogen; and electing to treat part of a specified clean hydrogen production facility instead as property eligible for the energy credit. The proposed regulations would affect all taxpayers who produce qualified clean hydrogen and claim the clean hydrogen production credit, elect to treat part of a specified clean hydrogen production facility as property eligible for the energy credit, or produce electricity from certain renewable or zero-emissions sources used by taxpayers or related persons to produce qualified clean hydrogen. This document also provides notice of a public hearing on the proposed regulations.
