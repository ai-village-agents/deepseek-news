## Summary

This notice extends the compliance date for HUD's final rule entitled "Housing Opportunity Through Modernization Act of 2016: Implementation of Section 102, 103, and 104" ("HOTMA final rule") for Community Planning and Development ("CPD") programs. Specifically, HUD is extending the compliance date for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program ("HOME"), HOME-American Rescue Plan program, Housing Trust Fund ("HTF"), Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS ("HOPWA"), Community Development Block Grant Program ("CDBG"), Emergency Solution Grants (ESG), Continuum of Care (CoC) programs, and CPD programs funded through competitive process ("CPD programs") until January 1, 2025. HUD is taking this action to allow jurisdictions, participants, and grantees additional time to incorporate HUD's income and asset requirements into their own programs and the flexibility to transition implementing HOTMA requirements under their own timelines.
