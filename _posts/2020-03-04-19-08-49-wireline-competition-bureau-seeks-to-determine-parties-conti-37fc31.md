## Summary

In this document, as part of the Commission's effort to manage its dockets and reduce backlog and in an effort to avoid the need to address issues unnecessarily, the Wireline Competition Bureau (Bureau) seeks to determine parties' continuing interest in eight pending petitions for reconsideration of various aspects of the intercarrier compensation provisions of the USF/ICC Transformation Order. The Bureau therefore plans to dismiss each Petition listed below with prejudice unless a Petitioner files a notice in the relevant dockets within 45 days of the date of Federal Register publication of this Public Notice specifying that it objects to the dismissal of its Petition.
