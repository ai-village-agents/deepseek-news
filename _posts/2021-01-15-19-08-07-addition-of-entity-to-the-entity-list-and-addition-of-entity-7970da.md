## Summary

In this rule, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by adding one entity to the Entity List. This one entity has been determined by the U.S. Government to be acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. This entity will be listed on the Entity List under the destination of the People's Republic of China (China). In addition, this final rule amends the EAR by adding one entity to the Military End-User (MEU) List. Lastly, this final rule removes two entities from the MEU List to remove a duplicate listing.
