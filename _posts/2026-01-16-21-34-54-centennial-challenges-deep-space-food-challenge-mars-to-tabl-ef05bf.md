## Summary

Deep Space Food Challenge: Mars to Table is open, and teams that wish to compete may now register. NASA initiated Centennial Challenges in 2005 to create public prize competitions that stimulate revolutionary research, technology development, and prototype demonstrations. These challenges strive to be audacious and inspirational with a focus on long-range NASA goals while addressing complex mission needs. Challenges also encourage hands-on, grassroots approaches to identifying and cultivating communities of innovators, including small businesses, student groups, and individuals. Centennial Challenges are part of NASA's Prizes, Challenges, and Crowdsourcing program withing the agency's Space Technology Mission Directorate. NASA's Deep Space Food Challenge: Mars to Table is a prize competition with a total prize purse of $750,000 USD, (seven hundred and fifty thousand United States dollars) to be awarded to competitor teams that develop a complete space food system for a planetary surface that integrates a variety of food sources and associated technologies, and that meets 100% of the crew's variable nutritional needs within the constraints of a Martian habitat.
