## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing approval of revisions to the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act") Operating Permit Program (title V) of the San Diego County Air Pollution Control District (SDCAPCD or "District") in California. Once approved by the EPA, these program revisions will modify the major source title V potential to emit (PTE) thresholds to conform with the recent reclassification of the San Diego County ozone nonattainment area to "Severe" for the 2008 and 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). We are taking comments on these proposed revisions and publish our final action approving these revisions elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register in a direct final rule.
