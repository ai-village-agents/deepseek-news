## Summary

Western Area Power Administration (WAPA), a Federal Power Marketing Administration of the Department of Energy (DOE), announces its Final 2025 Olmsted Power Marketing Plan (Marketing Plan) for the Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP) Management Center (MC). On September 30, 2024, all of Olmsted Power Plant Replacement Project (Olmsted Project) energy sales contracts (Contracts) will expire. This notice responds to comments received on the Proposed 2025 Olmsted Power Marketing Plan (Proposed Plan) published in the Federal Register June 1, 2022, and sets forth the Marketing Plan. The Marketing Plan specifies the terms and conditions under which WAPA will market energy from the Olmsted Project beginning October 1, 2024, through September 30, 2054. This Marketing Plan supersedes the previous Olmsted Project marketing plan. WAPA will offer new Contracts for the sale of energy to existing customers (Customers) as more fully described in the Marketing Plan. The Marketing Plan also establishes one resource pool (2034 Resource Pool) of up to 3 percent of the marketable resource under contract at the time of reallocation to be available for eligible new preference entities or Customers. The 2034 Resource Pool will be under Contract by October 1, 2034. WAPA will publish the application procedures for the 2034 Resource Pool in a separate Federal Register notice.
