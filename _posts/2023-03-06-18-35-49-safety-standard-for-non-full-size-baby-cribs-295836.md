## Summary

In December 2010, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) published a consumer product safety standard for non-full-size baby cribs (NFS cribs) pursuant to section 104 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA). The Commission's mandatory standard incorporated by reference the ASTM voluntary standard that was in effect for NFS cribs at the time, with modifications to make the standard more stringent, to further reduce the risk of injury associated with NFS cribs, and to exclude sections of the ASTM voluntary standard inapplicable to NFS cribs. The CPSIA sets forth a process for updating mandatory standards for durable infant or toddler products that are based on a voluntary standard, when a voluntary standards organization revises the standard. In November 2022, ASTM published a revised voluntary standard for NFS cribs, and it notified the Commission of this revised standard in December 2022. This direct final rule updates the mandatory standard for NFS cribs to incorporate by reference ASTM's 2022 version of the voluntary standard for NFS cribs.
