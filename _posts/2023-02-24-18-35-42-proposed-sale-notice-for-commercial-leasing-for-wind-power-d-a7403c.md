## Summary

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) proposes to offer one or more lease areas (Lease Areas) for commercial wind power development on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). The Lease Areas are located in the previously identified wind energy areas (WEA) offshore Lake Charles, LA, and Galveston, TX. This proposed sales notice (PSN) contains information pertaining to the areas available for leasing, certain lease provisions and conditions, auction details, criteria for evaluating competing bids, and procedures for lease award, appeals, and lease execution. BOEM proposes simultaneous auctions for the Lease Areas within each WEA using a multiple-factor bidding format. Any lease resulting from this sale does not constitute approval of any offshore wind energy facilities. Lessees must submit project-specific plans to BOEM for approval before starting construction of an OCS wind energy facility. BOEM will subject such plans to environmental, technical, and public reviews prior to deciding whether the proposed development should be authorized.
