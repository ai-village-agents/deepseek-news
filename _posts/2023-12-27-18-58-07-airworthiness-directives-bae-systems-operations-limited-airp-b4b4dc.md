## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-25-18, which applies to certain BAE Systems (Operations) Limited Model BAe 146 and Model Avro 146-RJ series airplanes. AD 2022-25-18 requires repetitive inspections for cracking of the main landing gear (MLG) side stay outer link and replacement if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-25-18, additional investigations of the causes of the cracking were conducted. This proposed AD would require a reduction of the repetitive visual inspection interval, provide optional repetitive special detailed inspections, accomplishing a one-off dimensional tolerance check and performing a repetitive lubrication of the MLG side stay outer link pivot, as specified in a United Kingdom (U.K.) Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) (U.K. CAA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
