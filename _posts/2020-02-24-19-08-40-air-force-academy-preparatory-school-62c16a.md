## Summary

This final rule removes the regulation concerning how the Department of the Air Force accesses individuals into the Air Force Academy Preparatory School. This part is outdated, contains internal guidance, reiterates statutory law, and is otherwise subject to the military function exemption to rulemaking. Candidates to the preparatory school are individually provided with any relevant entrance information and the current policy is publically available on the department's website. Therefore, this part is unnecessary and can be removed from the CFR.
