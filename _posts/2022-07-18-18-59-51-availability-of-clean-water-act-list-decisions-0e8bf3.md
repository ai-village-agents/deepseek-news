## Summary

This notice announces EPA's addition of certain water quality limited waters to the 2018 New York list of impaired waters, pursuant to the Clean Water Act (CWA), and requests public comment. The CWA and EPA's implementing regulations require States to submit, and EPA to approve or disapprove, lists of waters for which technology-based and other controls are not stringent enough to attain or maintain State water quality standards and for which total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) must be established. States are required to establish a priority ranking for waters on the list and to identify waters targeted for TMDL development over the next two years.
