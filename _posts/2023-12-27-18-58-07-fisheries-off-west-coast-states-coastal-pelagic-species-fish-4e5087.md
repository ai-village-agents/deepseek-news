## Summary

NMFS proposes to revise the overfishing limit (OFL) and acceptable biological catch (ABC), but maintain the annual catch limit (ACL), for the central subpopulation of northern anchovy (CSNA) in the U.S. exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off the West Coast under the Coastal Pelagic Species (CPS) Fishery Management Plan (FMP). NMFS is proposing an OFL of 243,779 metric tons (mt) and ABC of 60,945 mt, and an ACL of 25,000 mt. Under current regulations, if the ACL for this stock is reached or projected to be reached in a fishing year (January 1- December 31), then fishing will be closed until it reopens at the start of the next fishing year. This rulemaking is intended to conserve and manage CSNA off the U.S. West Coast.
