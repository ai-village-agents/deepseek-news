## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of oxirane, 2-methyl-, polymer with oxirane, ether with 1,2,3-propanetriol (3:1); minimum average number molecular weight 6,000 Daltons (CAS Reg. No. 9082-00-2) when used as an inert ingredient in a pesticide chemical formulation. Delta Analytical Corporation on behalf of Borchers Americas, Inc., submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of oxirane, 2-methyl-, polymer with oxirane, ether with 1,2,3-propanetriol (3:1) on food or feed commodities when used in accordance with these exemptions.
