## Summary

This document provides the public with notice that, on April 7, 2023, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) submitted a request for amendment (RFA) to its FRA-certified positive train control (PTC) system in order to support the implementation of PTC on its commuter rail network. On MBTA's North Side, the PTC System in the area is being reconfigured and must be taken out of service during the recommissioning of Automatic Train Control (ATC) and the subsequent recommissioning of MBTA's Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System II (ACSES II). FRA is publishing this notice and inviting public comment on the railroad's RFA to its PTC system.
