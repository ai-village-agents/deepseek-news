## Summary

The Coast Guard has issued a temporary deviation from the operating schedule that governs the Lady's Island (Woods Memorial) Bridge across the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway (AICW) (Beaufort River), mile 536.0, at Beaufort, SC. South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) has requested the Coast Guard consider changing the operating schedule to remove the seasonal operating schedule aligning with other drawbridges along the AICW in SC. This deviation will test a change to the drawbridge operation schedule to determine whether a permanent change to the schedule is needed. The Coast Guard is seeking comments from the public regarding this deviation.
