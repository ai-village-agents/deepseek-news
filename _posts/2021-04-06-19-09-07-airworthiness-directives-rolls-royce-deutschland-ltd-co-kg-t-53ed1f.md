## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Trent 1000-A2, 1000- AE2, 1000-C2, 1000-CE2, 1000-D2, 1000-E2, 1000-G2, 1000-H2, 1000-J2, 1000-K2, and 1000-L2 model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by the manufacturer's analysis which determined that cracks may initiate in the front seal fins and cause cracks in the low-pressure turbine (LPT) disk. This AD requires repetitive inspection of the seal fins and, depending on the results of the inspection, replacement of the LPT disk before further flight. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
