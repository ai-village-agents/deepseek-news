## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for a new information collection. The collection involves obtaining information from FAA employees and contractors who will travel overseas on official business. The information to be collected will be used in the event an FAA employee and/or contractor is isolated overseas and requires lifesaving assistance.
