## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to grant a two-year exemption to the State of Alaska from the limitations imposed by the commercial driver's license (CDL) regulations on the State's ability to issue restricted CDLs. The exemption allows the State to waive specified portions of the CDL skills test for drivers in 14 defined geographical areas that lack infrastructure to allow completion of the full skills test. Drivers who receive a restricted CDL under the provisions of this exemption are also exempt from the Entry-Level Driver Training (ELDT) regulations. FMCSA concludes that granting the exemption, subject to the terms and conditions set forth below, is likely to achieve a level of safety equivalent to or greater than the level of safety that would be obtained absent the exemption.
