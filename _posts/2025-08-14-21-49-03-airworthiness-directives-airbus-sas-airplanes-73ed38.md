## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A318, A319, A320, and A321 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a heavy maintenance check that found elongation on the upper section of the vertical member's assembly at the frame (FR) 24A cargo panel sub-structure. This AD requires a check for certain repairs, and as applicable, repetitive detailed visual inspections of the vertical member's upper part and the upper fittings at FR 24A in the forward cargo compartment and corrective actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
