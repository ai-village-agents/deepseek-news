## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain CFM International, S.A. (CFM) LEAP-1A model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by reports of non-synchronous vibrations resulting in more open clearances and potential hot gas ingestion into the high- pressure turbine (HPT) rotor cavity, which may result in thermal degradation of the HPT rotor interstage seal and HPT rotor stage 2 disk. This AD requires inspection of the stage 2 HPT nozzle assembly honeycomb and HPT stator stationary seal honeycomb. Depending on the results of the inspection, this AD requires replacement of the stage 2 HPT nozzle assembly honeycomb, HPT stator stationary seal, HPT rotor interstage seal, and HPT rotor stage 2 disk. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
