## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A330-243, -243F, -841, and -941 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of loss of data synchronization between radio management panels (RMPs) and the audio management unit (AMU). This AD requires revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) by providing instructions to address dual loss of RMP data synchronization, and the existing minimum equipment list (MEL) by removing relief for an inoperative RMP 3. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
