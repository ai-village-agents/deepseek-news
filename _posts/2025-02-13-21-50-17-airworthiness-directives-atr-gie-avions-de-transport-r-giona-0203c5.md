## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-10-08, which applies to all ATR--GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42-200, ATR42-300, and ATR42-320 airplanes. AD 2023-10-08 requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2023-10-08, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would continue to require certain actions in AD 2023-10-08 and would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
