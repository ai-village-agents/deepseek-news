## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A350-1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of a loud noise and vibration in the belly fairing (BF) access panel above the wings. This AD requires a one-time detailed inspection of the BF access panels and, depending on findings, accomplishment of applicable corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference (IBR). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
