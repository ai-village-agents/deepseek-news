## Summary

NMFS implements an accountability measure (AM) for spiny lobster in the U.S. exclusive economic zone (EEZ) around Puerto Rico. NMFS has determined that the annual catch limit (ACL) for spiny lobster in Puerto Rico was exceeded based on average landings during the 2017 through 2019 fishing years. Therefore, NMFS reduces the length of the 2022 fishing season for spiny lobster in the EEZ around Puerto Rico by the amount necessary to ensure that landings do not exceed the ACL in 2022. This AM is necessary to protect the spiny lobster resource in the EEZ around Puerto Rico.
