## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes to remove the note under diagnostic code (DC) 7629 requiring an endometriosis diagnosis that is confirmed by laparoscopy. This update would ensure the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (VASRD) continues to align with current medical practice and would expedite the process for establishing service connection.
