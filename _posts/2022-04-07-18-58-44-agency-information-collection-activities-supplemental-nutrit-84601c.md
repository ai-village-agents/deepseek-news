## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice invites the general public and other public agencies to comment on this proposed information collection. This is a revision of a currently approved collection and existing burden in use without a valid OMB control number in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). This information collection captures the burden associated with the requirement that States make ineligible SNAP participants with substantial lottery or gambling winnings and establish cooperative agreements with gaming entities within their States to identify SNAP participants with substantial winnings. Individuals and households are required to report substantial winnings. This revision removes the one-time start-up burden hours that were associated with establishing the collection of this information and modifies the ongoing burden hours associated with SNAP State agency eligibility workers in addition to bringing other burden activities associated with resource verification requirements into compliance.
