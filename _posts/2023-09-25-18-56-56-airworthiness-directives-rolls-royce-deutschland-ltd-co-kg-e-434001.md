## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-26-11 for all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd. & Co. KG (RRD) Model RB211-Trent 875-17, 877-17, 884-17, 884B-17, 892-17, 892B-17, and 895-17 engines. AD 2021-26-11 required replacing the affected fuel pump on at least one affected engine. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-26-11, the FAA has determined that replacing all affected fuel pumps on all installed engines is necessary to address the unsafe condition. This AD was prompted by reports of single-engine events caused by water contamination, which led to corrosion on the fuel pump that resulted in loss of engine thrust. This AD requires replacing the affected fuel pump on at least one engine before further flight and replacing all affected fuel pumps within a specified compliance time. This AD would also prohibit installing any affected engine onto any airplane or any affected fuel pump onto any engine, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference (IBR). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
