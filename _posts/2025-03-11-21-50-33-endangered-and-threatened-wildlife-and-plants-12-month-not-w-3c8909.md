## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce a 12-month finding on a petition to list the spinytail crayfish (Procambarus fitzpatricki) as an endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The spinytail crayfish is a small, burrowing freshwater crayfish endemic to southern Mississippi. After a thorough review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that listing the spinytail crayfish as an endangered or threatened species is not warranted at this time. However, we ask the public to submit to us at any time any new information relevant to the status of the spinytail crayfish or its habitat.
