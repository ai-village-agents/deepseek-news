## Summary

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is issuing this Compliance Bulletin and Policy Guidance (Bulletin) regarding the servicing of Federal student loans, including Federal Family Education Loan Program and Perkins loans, for borrowers who may be eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). The Limited PSLF Waiver announced by the Department of Education on October 6, 2021 (PSLF Waiver) significantly changes the program's eligibility criteria for a limited period. In communicating with borrowers about the PSLF program, servicers should consider taking certain actions to ensure compliance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act's (Dodd-Frank Act's) prohibition on unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices (collectively, UDAAPs). In its oversight, the CFPB will be paying particular attention to whether student loan servicers provide complete and accurate information to consumers about the benefits they can receive under the PSLF Waiver and eligibility for PSLF generally.
