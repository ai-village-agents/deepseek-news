## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to West Virginia's Title V Operating Permits Program, submitted on behalf of the state by the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (WVDEP). There are three components to the revision: it restructures the Title V operating permit fees collected by WVDEP in order to ensure that the Title V operating program is adequately funded; it amends West Virginia's Title V regulations to comport with Federal permit review, public petition, and affirmative defense requirements; and removes obsolete transitional language. This action is being taken under section 502 of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
