## Summary

Notice is hereby given that NMFS received an application from the Wiyot Tribe in Loleta, California for modification and renewal of an U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) Section 10(a)(1)(A) scientific and enhancement permit (Permit 22270-2R). The purpose of the permit is to enhance the survival of threatened Southern Oregon/Northern California Coast (SONCC) Evolutionary Significant Unit (ESU) of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch); threatened California Coast (CC) ESU Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha); and threatened Northern California (NC) Distinct Population Segment (DPS) of steelhead (O. mykiss) by segregating and removing predatory non-native Sacramento River pikeminnow using a variety of techniques. The University of California at Berkeley and Stillwater Sciences are co-investigators on the permit and will assist with implementation of the permit activities. The public is hereby notified that the application for Permit 22270-2R is available for review and comment before NMFS either approves or disapproves the application.
