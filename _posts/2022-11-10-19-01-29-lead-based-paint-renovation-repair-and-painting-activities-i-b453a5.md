## Summary

This document announces that on October 1, 2022, the State of Vermont was deemed authorized under section 404(a) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to administer and enforce requirements for the lead-based paint pre-renovation education and renovation, repair and painting (RRP) program. This document also announces that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is seeking comment during a 45-day public comment period, and it is providing an opportunity to request a public hearing within the first 15 days of this comment period on whether Vermont's program is at least as protective as the federal program and provides for adequate enforcement. This document also announces that the authorization of the Vermont pre-renovation education and renovation, repair and painting program, which was deemed authorized by regulation and statute, will continue without further notice unless the EPA, based on its own review and/or comments received during the comment period, disapproves the Vermont program application.
