## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a revision to the San Diego County Air Pollution Control District (SDCAPCD) portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). This revision concerns emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from adhesive material application operations. We are approving a local rule that regulates these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the "Act").
