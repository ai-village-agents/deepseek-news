## Summary

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is amending the rules for processing garnishment orders for child support and/or alimony ("support regulations") and the rules for processing commercial garnishment orders. This rule amends both the support regulations and the commercial garnishment regulations to update the list of agents designated to accept legal process under the relevant appendices of our regulations and deletes a duplicative reference.
