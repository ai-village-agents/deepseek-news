## Summary

The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) of the Department of Labor (Department) is removing the regulations that implemented and governed the Title I Workforce Investment Act (WIA) programs at the national, State, and local levels and provided program requirements applicable to all WIA formula and competitive funds. Title I of WIA was repealed by Congress with the enactment of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) on June 22, 2014, and all remaining grant funding under Title I has been closed out by the Department. Accordingly, these regulations are no longer necessary, and the Department is taking this action to remove regulations from the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) for programs that are no longer operative.
