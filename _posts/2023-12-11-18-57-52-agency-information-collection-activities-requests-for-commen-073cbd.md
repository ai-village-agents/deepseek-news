The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on October 02, 2022. The collection involves a survey of uncrewed-aircraft-systems (UAS) operators within the United States. The information gathered through the survey's questionnaire on flight behavior and fleet characteristics is used to inform UAS rule making and guide investment in UAS research and infrastructure.
