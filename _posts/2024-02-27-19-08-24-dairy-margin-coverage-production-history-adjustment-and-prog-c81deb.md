## Summary

This rule revises the regulations for Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) as required by the Further Continuing Appropriations and Other Extensions Act, 2024, which extends provisions of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (2018 Farm Bill) and amends the Agricultural Act of 2014 (2014 Farm Bill) to allow eligible dairy operations to make a one-time adjustment to established production history and extend DMC through 2024. In addition, the rule extends eligibility of multi-year (lock-in) contracts for an additional year until December 31, 2024, and applies the discounted DMC premium rate to the newly established adjusted base production history.
