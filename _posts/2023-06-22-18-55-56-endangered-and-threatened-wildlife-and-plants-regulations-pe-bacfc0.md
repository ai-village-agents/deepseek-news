## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to revise our regulations concerning protections of endangered species and threatened species under the Endangered Species Act (Act). We are proposing to reinstate the general application of the "blanket rule" option for protecting newly listed threatened species pursuant to section 4(d) of the Act, with the continued option to promulgate species-specific rules. We are also proposing to extend to federally recognized Tribes the exceptions to prohibitions for threatened species that the regulations currently provide to the employees or agents of the Service and other Federal and State agencies to aid, salvage, or dispose of threatened species. We are also proposing minor changes to clarify or correct the existing regulations for endangered and threatened species; these proposed minor changes would not alter the substance or scope of the regulations. We also request comments on an additional provision under consideration, but not currently proposed, that would extend to federally recognized Tribes the exceptions to prohibitions for threatened species that the regulations currently provide to employees or agents of the Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and State agencies for take associated with conservation-related activities.
