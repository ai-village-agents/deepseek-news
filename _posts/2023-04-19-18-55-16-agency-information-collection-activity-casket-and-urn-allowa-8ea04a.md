## Summary

The National Cemetery Administration (NCA), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), is announcing an opportunity for public comment on the proposed collection of certain information by the agency. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995, Federal agencies are required to publish notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of information, including each new collection and allow 60 days for public comment in response to the notice. This notice solicits comments on the information needed that implements statutory authority for NCA to provide an allowance for the purchase of caskets and urns for the interment of the remains of Veterans without next of kin (NOK) or sufficient resources available for burial.
