## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) debarring George Kuiper for a period of 5 years from importing or offering for import any drug into the United States. FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Kuiper was convicted of multiple felony offenses: One count of smuggling, one count of conspiracy to smuggle goods into the United States and to introduce into interstate commerce unapproved drugs, and one count of introduction into interstate commerce of unapproved drugs. The factual basis supporting Mr. Kuiper's convictions, as described below, is conduct relating to the importation into the United States of a drug or controlled substance. Mr. Kuiper was given notice of the proposed debarment and was given an opportunity to request a hearing to show why he should not be debarred. As of December 8, 2021 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Mr. Kuiper had not responded. Mr. Kuiper's failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this matter.
