## Summary

This notice of NSPIRE Inspection Standards serves as a complementary document to the Economic Growth Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act: Implementation of National Standards for the Physical Inspection of Real Estate (NSPIRE) rule. The rule provides that HUD publish in the Federal Register a set of NSPIRE inspection Standards to consolidate and align housing quality requirements and associated inspection Standards across programs. After developing and testing draft Standards and receiving public comment on prior versions of the Standards, HUD is providing the final NSPIRE physical inspection Standards to accompany HUD's final rule. Additionally, HUD is providing a list of life-threatening conditions and incorporating them into the NSPIRE inspection Standards in place of codifying the list, which HUD proposed in the "Housing Opportunity Through Modernization Act (HOTMA) of 2016--Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) and Project Based Voucher Implementation: Additional Streamlining Changes" proposed rule. These final Standards adopt the proposed Standards with changes identified in this notice.
