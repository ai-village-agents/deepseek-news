## Summary

On April 18, 2019, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) published a final rule amending the "Arbitration Policy; Schedule of Fees" to implement an increase in user fees. After careful review, FMCS finds that this rule is no longer suitable for publication. Therefore, this final rule rescinds the appendix regarding the Arbitration Policy; Schedule of Fees.
