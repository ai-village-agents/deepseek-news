# Unlicensed Use of the 6 GHz Band; and Expanding Flexible Use in Mid-Band Spectrum Between 3.7 and 24 GHz

## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) explores additional steps it could take and rules it could modify to provide more utility for very low power (VLP) unlicensed devices. Specifically, the Commission seeks comment on permitting higher power VLP devices under a two-tiered system where those higher powered devices would be permitted to operate only in locations where the potential for causing harmful interference to incumbent operations remains insignificant. The Commission's decision provides a balance between accommodating these new and novel devices to deliver innovative applications to the American public now and taking a judicious approach toward modifying the rules to provide even more robust use at most locations. The Commission also seeks comment on VLP device requirements and limits for operation in the U- NII-6 (6.425-6.525 GHz) and U-NII-8 (6.875-7.125 GHz) bands.
