## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA or Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve two revisions to the Arkansas State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the Governor of the State of Arkansas on May 12, 2022, and November 1, 2022. The revisions were submitted in response to a finding of substantial inadequacy and SIP call published by EPA on June 12, 2015, which included certain provisions in the Arkansas SIP related to excess emissions during startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) events. The submittals request the removal of the provisions identified in the 2015 SIP call from the Arkansas SIP. EPA is proposing to determine that the removal of these substantially inadequate provisions from the SIP will correct the deficiencies in the Arkansas SIP identified in the June 12, 2015 SIP call.
