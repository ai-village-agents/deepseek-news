## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a permitting rule submitted as a revision to the Amador Air District (AAD or "District") portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). This revision concerns the District's New Source Review (NSR) permitting program for new and modified sources of air pollution under part D of Title I of the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act"). This action will update the District's applicable SIP with a rule revised to address deficiencies identified in a previous limited disapproval action by the EPA related to the District's NSR permitting program under Part D. This final approval action permanently terminates all sanctions, sanctions clocks, and federal implementation plan clocks triggered by our January 12, 2022 limited disapproval action. This action also finalizes regulatory text to clarify that Amador County is not subject to the Federal Implementation Plan related to protection of visibility.
