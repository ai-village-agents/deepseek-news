## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping duty (AD) order on certain steel nails (steel nails) from the Sultanate of Oman (Oman). This review covers 15 exporters and producers from Oman. The period of review (POR) is July 1, 2023, through June 30, 2024. The sole mandatory respondent in this review is Oman Fasteners, LLC (Oman Fasteners). Commerce preliminarily determines that Oman Fasteners made sales of subject merchandise below normal value (NV) during the POR. Additionally, we are rescinding this review, in part, with respect to one company for which all requests for review were withdrawn and with respect to 13 companies, which had no suspended entries. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.
