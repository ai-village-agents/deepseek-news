## Summary

The Department of the Army (Army) completed a programmatic environmental assessment (PEA) regarding the impacts of stationing a Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF) at 13 existing Army garrisons and joint bases, and is encouraging community participation in this process. The Army is making the PEA and a draft finding of no significant impact (FONSI) available for public comment. The PEA determined the environmental and socioeconomic impacts that would result from the Proposed Action would be either less than significant or significant but mitigable at all of the considered locations. The draft FONSI concluded that an environmental impact statement (EIS) is not required. Unless other significant impacts are brought to the Army's attention during public review of the PEA, the Army will finalize the PEA and FONSI and will not prepare an EIS.
