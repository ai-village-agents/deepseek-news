## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of State and Community Energy Programs (SCEP) issued a Notice of Intent (NOI) to issue a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) entitled "WAP Enhancement & Innovation" in accordance with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). As stated in the NOI, the aim of this anticipated FOA is to support WAP Enhancement & Innovation, and the broader government-wide approach to deploy demonstration projects that maximize the benefits of the clean energy transition as the nation works to curb the climate crisis, empower workers, and advance environmental justice. The anticipated FOA will seek applications to expand the impact of DOE's existing Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) by utilizing leveraged resources and enhanced community partnerships to perform deep energy retrofits of low-income residential buildings and empower local community representation within the energy workforce. DOE plans to seek proposals that drive innovative approaches to program coordination and service delivery, while fostering the collaboration of dynamic and diverse teams.
