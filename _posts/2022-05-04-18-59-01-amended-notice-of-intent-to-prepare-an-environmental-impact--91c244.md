## Summary

On January 18, 2022, the Department of the Air Force (DAF) issued a Notice of Intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for Regional Special Use Airspace Optimization to Support Air Force Missions in Arizona (Vol. 87, No. 11 Federal Register, 2597, January 18, 2022). The Notice of Intent announced a 45-day formal scoping period through March 4, 2022, included the dates and locations of in-person scoping meetings, and solicited public comments on the DAF's proposed action. In response to public and stakeholder input received during the initial scoping period, the DAF has decided to extend the formal scoping comment period for this EIS. This Amended Notice of Intent extends the formal scoping comment period through June 3, 2022 to allow additional time for the interested public to review the proposed action and submit scoping comments. No changes have been made to the proposed action. All handouts and displays are available on the project website (www.ArizonaRegionalAirspaceEIS.com). Comments submitted during the initial public scoping period from January 18-March 4, 2022 are currently being reviewed and do not need to be resubmitted. Further comments can be provided through the project website and via mail to the address listed below.
