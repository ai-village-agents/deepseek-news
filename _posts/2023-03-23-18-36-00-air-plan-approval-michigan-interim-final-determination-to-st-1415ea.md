## Summary

In the Proposed Rules section of this Federal Register, EPA is proposing conditional approval of Michigan's State Implementation Plan (SIP), as revised on December 20, 2022, for attaining the 2010 1-hour primary sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS). Based on that proposed conditional approval, EPA is making an interim final determination (IFD) by this action. Although this action is effective upon publication, EPA will take comment on this interim final determination.
