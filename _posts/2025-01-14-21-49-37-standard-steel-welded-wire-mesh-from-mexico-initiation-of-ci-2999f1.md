## Summary

In response to requests from Keysteel Corp., Mid-South Wire Company, National Wire LLC, Oklahoma Steel & Wire Co., and Wire Mesh Corp. (collectively, the requesters), the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is initiating a country-wide circumvention inquiry to determine whether standard steel welded wire mesh (wire mesh) from Mexico, which is completed in the United States from low-carbon steel wire produced in Mexico, is circumventing the antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on wire mesh from Mexico.
