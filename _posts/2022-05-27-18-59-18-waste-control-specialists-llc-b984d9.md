## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing an environmental assessment (EA) and finding of no significant impact (FONSI) in support of the NRC's consideration of a request from Waste Control Specialists LLC (WCS) to continue to store certain transuranic waste, which originated from the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), without an NRC license under the terms of a 2014 Order. The 2014 Order exempted WCS from the NRC's regulations concerning special nuclear material (SNM). The current action is in response to a request by WCS dated March 18, 2022, to extend the possession time to temporarily store certain waste at specific locations at the WCS Site until December 31, 2024.
