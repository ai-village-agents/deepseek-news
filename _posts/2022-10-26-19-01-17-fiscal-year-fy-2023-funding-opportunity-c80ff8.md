## Summary

This notice is to inform the public that the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) intends to award $47 million (total costs) for up to one year to Vibrant Emotional Health for the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline Access Improvement Project. Funding for this program is from the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, [Pub. L. 117-159, Division B, Title II]. Under this cooperative agreement, Vibrant Emotional Health will expand access to the local and national Lifeline backup centers, language services, system evaluation and data reporting, and access to specialized care for populations to be known at higher risk for suicide by: (1) expanding options for connection and support for individuals at higher risk of suicide, which includes but is not limited to LGBTQI+, American Indian/Alaska Native, rural individuals, individuals with mental illness and substance use disorders, Black/African-American youth and older men; (2) expanding current language access services to include Spanish chat and text, and videophone for those deaf and hard of hearing; and (3) improve access and capacity utilization of the nationwide backup system while maximizing state and territory response. Funding Opportunity Title: 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline Access Improvement Project. Assistance Listing Number: 93.243. Authority: Section 520E-3 of the Public Health Service Act, as amended. Justification: Eligibility for this award is limited to the Mental Health Association of New York City, Inc. (DBA Vibrant Emotional Health). Vibrant Emotional Health is the current Lifeline system administrator and this award expand options for connection and support for individuals at higher risk of suicide, expand current language access services to include Spanish chat and text services, work to activate videophone for those deaf and hard of hearing, and improve access and capacity utilization of the nationwide backup system while maximizing state and territory response. Since 2005, Vibrant Emotional Health has provided oversight and management of the NSPL and its local call centers, backup centers, Spanish network, and chat/text functions with a network of over 200 centers in all fifty states. In FY 2021, SAMHSA issued a competitive Notice of Funding Opportunity for the NSPL, which was awarded to Vibrant Emotional Health for a 5-year project period (September 30, 2021, to September 29, 2026). Vibrant Emotional Health has the infrastructure, experience, and national reach to work with the backup centers, language services, and chat/text organizations to address the increased contact volumes expected in 2023. With the transition to 988 accomplished, greater services, such as expanding access to the local and national Lifeline backup centers, language services, system evaluation and data reporting, and access to specialized care for populations to be known at higher risk for suicide, are required for the 988 projected contacts in 2023 and beyond. It would not be possible for any other organization to establish the relationships or technical systems with crisis centers that Vibrant Emotional Health has built over the last 15 years to accomplish the goals by December 2023. Any significant modification to the current 988 network, technology platform and/or administration would significantly delay operational outcomes and run the risk of significant numbers of unanswered calls, chats, and texts of individuals in crisis. Since the transition to 988, the Lifeline, under Vibrant's network administration and HHS funding, has seen call answer rates significantly improve and far greater numbers of individuals served in crisis. The impact of having administration disruption and splitting of network oversight significantly increases public safety risk now more than ever as 988 is quickly becoming transitioned to a greater utilized public service and an entry way into more centralized behavioral health crisis care. Oversight of the expanded back up, language services, and chat/text centers would be fragmented and run the risk of both inefficiencies and adverse outcomes, as well as coordination, quality monitoring, and rapid response could be compromised. Vibrant has extensive engagement, including direct contractual obligations, with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Crisis Line (VCL) that helps ensure call connectivity between Vibrant and VCL, backup services, and engagement across the Lifeline local crisis centers on Veteran identification, care, and linkage to VA. and is uniquely qualified to carry-out the requirements of this funding opportunity.
