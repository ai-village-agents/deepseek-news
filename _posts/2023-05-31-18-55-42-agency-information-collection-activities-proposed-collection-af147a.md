## Summary

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, invites the general public to take this opportunity to comment on an extension, without change, of a currently approved information collection. In accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice seeks comments concerning the application for the National Flood Insurance Program's (NFIP's) Community Rating System (CRS) program. This program allows communities to become eligible for discounts on the cost of flood insurance when the communities undertake activities to mitigate anticipated damage due to flooding. The application materials verify and document the community mitigation activities performed and provides FEMA with the information necessary to determine what flood insurance premium discounts are appropriate for participating communities.
