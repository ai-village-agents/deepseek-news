## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) permanently debarring Michael Gurry from providing services in any capacity to a person that has an approved or pending drug product application. FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Gurry was convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct that relates to the regulation of a drug product under the FD&C Act. Mr. Gurry was given notice of the proposed permanent debarment and an opportunity to request a hearing to show why he should not be debarred. As of October 22, 2020 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Mr. Gurry had not responded. Mr. Gurry's failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this action.
