## Summary

In this final rule, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to create an additional option for the renewal of temporary denial orders (TDOs) by allowing BIS, under certain circumstances, to request that the Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement renew an existing TDO for a period of no more than one year, rather than the current renewal period of no more than 180 days. This final rule also makes some conforming changes to remove references to the "EAA," the Export Administration Act (EAA), and add in their place references to "ECRA," the Export Control Reform Act (ECRA), to reflect the EAR's current statutory authority.
