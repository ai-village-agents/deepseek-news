## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, Agency, or we) is announcing the availability of a final guidance for industry (GFI) #187A entitled "Heritable Intentional Genomic Alterations in Animals: Risk-Based Approach." This guidance is intended to clarify FDA's requirements and recommendations with respect to heritable intentional genomic alterations (IGAs) in animals. The guidance is being issued as one of two companion documents. This guidance, entitled "Heritable Intentional Genomic Alterations in Animals: Risk-Based Approach," describes FDA's risk-based regulatory approach to the oversight of heritable IGAs in animals. This means that for people or companies developing certain types of IGAs in animals, FDA may not expect them to submit an application or get approval before marketing their product. For other types of IGAs in animals that do go through the approval process, the companion draft guidance document, GFI #187B entitled "Heritable Intentional Genomic Alterations in Animals: The Approval Process" describes how the approval process applies to heritable IGAs in animals.
