## Summary

NMFS implements an accountability measure (AM) for the gag recreational sector in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Gulf for the 2025 fishing year. NMFS has projected that the 2025 recreational annual catch target (ACT) for gag will be reached by September 15, 2025. Therefore, NMFS closes the recreational sector for Gulf gag on September 15, 2025, and it will remain closed through the end of the fishing year on December 31, 2025. This closure is necessary to protect the Gulf gag resource.
