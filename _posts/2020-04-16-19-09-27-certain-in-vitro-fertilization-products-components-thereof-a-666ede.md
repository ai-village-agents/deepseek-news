The complaint, as supplemented and amended, further alleges that an industry in the United States exists and that alleged violations threaten to destroy or substantially injure an industry in the United States, as required by the applicable Federal Statutes. The complainant requests that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a general exclusion order, or in the alternative a limited exclusion order, and cease and desist orders.
