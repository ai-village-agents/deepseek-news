## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (AHD) Model EC135P1, EC135P2, EC135P2+, EC135P3, EC135T1, EC135T2, EC135T2+, EC135T2, EC135T3, and EC635T2+ helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of a separated tail rotor (T/R) blade due to a crack which was caused by intergranular corrosion. This AD requires repetitively inspecting certain part- numbered T/R blades for a crack and, depending on the results, removing any cracked T/R blade from service. This AD also prohibits installing certain T/R blades on any helicopter unless certain requirements are met. These actions are specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) emergency AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
