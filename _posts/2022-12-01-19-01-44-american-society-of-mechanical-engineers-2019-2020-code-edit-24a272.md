## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) published a final rule in the Federal Register on October 27, 2022, amending its regulations to incorporate by reference the 2019 Edition of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section III, Division 1, and Section XI, Division 1, and the 2020 Edition of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Operation and Maintenance of Nuclear Power Plants, Division 1: OM Code: Section IST, for nuclear power plants. These amendments were made in accordance with NRC's policy to periodically update the regulations to incorporate by reference new editions of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Codes and are intended to maintain the safety of nuclear power plants and to make NRC activities more effective and efficient. The final rule contained minor editorial errors, and this action is necessary to correct the final rule and the regulations.
