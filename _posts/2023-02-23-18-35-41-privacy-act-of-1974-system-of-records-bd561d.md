## Summary

In accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is providing public notice of a modification to a previously announced system of records, Harassment Report Case Files/NASA 10HRCF. The most significant modification is that the system of records will now be exempt from certain subsections of the Privacy Act. A statement of purpose for maintaining the records was also added. Enhancements were made to the categories of individuals, the records source categories, and the records access procedures. One duplicative routine use was deleted, and three new routine uses unique to this system were added. The notice incorporates locations and NASA standard routine uses. The system of records is more fully described in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section of this notice.
