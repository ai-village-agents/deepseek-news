## Summary

NMFS is publishing its draft 2020 List of Foreign Fisheries (LOFF), as required by the regulations implementing the Fish and Fish Product Import Provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). The draft 2020 LOFF reflects new information received from nations submitting their 2019 Progress Reports on interactions between commercial fisheries exporting fish and fish products to the United States and marine mammals, and updates the 2017 LOFF. NMFS classified each commercial fishery in this draft 2020 LOFF into one of two categories, either "export" or "exempt," based upon frequency and likelihood of incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals likely to occur incidental to each fishery. The classification of a fishery on the draft 2020 LOFF determines which regulatory requirements will be applicable to that fishery for it to receive a comparability finding necessary to export fish and fish products to the United States from that fishery.
