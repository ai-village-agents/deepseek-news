The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of Government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies to comment on a proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled IRB Authorization Agreement for Human Research. The purpose of the data collection is to keep track of, and provide regulatory oversight for, those institutions that have elected to rely on the CDC IRB's review of research studies.
