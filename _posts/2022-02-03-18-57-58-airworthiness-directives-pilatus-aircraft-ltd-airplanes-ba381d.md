## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Pilatus Aircraft Ltd. (Pilatus) Model PC-24 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a failure of the dual ethernet communication channel on a dual-channel data concentration and processing unit, which triggered the opening of electronic circuit breakers that caused several unintended system activations. This proposed AD would require installing a software (SW) upgrade to the utility management system (UMS), as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
