# Airworthiness Directives; Various Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for various airplanes modified with a certain configuration of the Garmin GFC 500 Autopilot System installed per Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) No. SA01866WI. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of an un-commanded automatic pitch trim runaway when the autopilot was first engaged. This proposed AD would require updating the applicable Garmin GFC 500 Autopilot System software for your airplane and would prohibit installing earlier versions of that software. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
