## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (Commission or FCC) published a document in the Federal Register on January 26, 2024, concerning an Order on Reconsideration that addresses the Petition for Clarification and Partial Reconsideration (Petition) filed by CTIA and the Competitive Carriers Association (CCA) (collectively, Petitioners) of the Commission's Report and Order regarding the "Mandatory Disaster Response Initiative" (MDRI) by extending the compliance deadline to implement elements of the MDRI to May 1, 2024. In its Order on Reconsideration, the Commission also agrees with the request to treat Roaming under Disaster arrangements (RuDs) as presumptively confidential when filed with the Commission. In this document, the Commission is withdrawing its previous Federal Register publication of the Order on Reconsideration and substituting the present document to correct certain information regarding the compliance date and effective date. In addition, this document announces that, on October 27, 2023, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved, for a period of three years, the information collection requirements associated with the rules adopted in the Report and Order. The OMB Control Number is 3060-1317. The Commission also announces that compliance with the rules will be required, and revises its rules to specify this date and to remove text advising that compliance was not required until OMB review was completed. This action is consistent with the 2023 Order on Reconsideration, which stated that the Commission would publish a document in the Federal Register announcing a compliance date and revise the rule accordingly.
