## Summary

Through this notice, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announces that the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) is extending the designation of Burma for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 18 months, effective from November 26, 2022, through May 25, 2024. This extension allows existing TPS beneficiaries to retain TPS through May 25, 2024, so long as they otherwise continue to meet the eligibility requirements for TPS. Existing TPS beneficiaries who wish to extend their status through May 25, 2024, must re-register during the 60-day re-registration period described in this notice. The Secretary is also redesignating Burma for TPS. The redesignation of Burma allows additional Burmese nationals (and individuals having no nationality who last habitually resided in Burma) who have been continuously residing in the United States since September 25, 2022 to apply for TPS for the first time during the initial registration period described under the redesignation information in this notice. In addition to demonstrating continuous residence in the United States since September 25, 2022 and meeting other eligibility criteria, initial applicants for TPS under this designation must demonstrate that they have been continuously physically present in the United States since November 26, 2022, the effective date of this redesignation of Burma for TPS.
