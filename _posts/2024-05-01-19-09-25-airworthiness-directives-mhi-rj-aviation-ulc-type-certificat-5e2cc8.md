## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain MHI RJ Aviation ULC Model CL-600-2C10 (Regional Jet Series 700, 701 & 702); CL-600-2C11 (Regional Jet Series 550); CL-600-2D15 (Regional Jet Series 705); and CL-600-2D24 (Regional Jet Series 900) airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that a potential crack of the tombstone fitting lug cannot be detected as the bushings remain in place during accomplishment of the special detailed inspection (SDI) required by a certain airworthiness limitation (ALI) task. This AD requires inspecting the tombstone fitting lug with a new SDI sub-surface ultrasound procedure when accomplishing the ALI task, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also requires corrective actions if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
