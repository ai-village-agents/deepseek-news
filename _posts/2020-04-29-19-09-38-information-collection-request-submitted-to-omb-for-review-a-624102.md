## Summary

The U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has submitted an information collection request (ICR), Compliance Assurance Monitoring Program (EPA ICR Number 1663.10, OMB Control Number 2060-0376) to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). This is a proposed extension of the ICR, which is currently approved through June 30, 2020. Public comments were previously requested via the Federal Register on August 26, 2019, during a 60-day comment period. This document allows for an additional 30 days for public comments. A fuller description of the ICR is given below, including its estimated burden and cost to the public. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
