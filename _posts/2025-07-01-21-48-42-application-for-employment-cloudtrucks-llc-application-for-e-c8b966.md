## Summary

FMCSA requests public comment on the application submitted by CloudTrucks, LLC (CloudTrucks) for an exemption from certain requirements of the application for employment regulations. Specifically, CloudTrucks seeks an exemption from the requirement to collect the following information from prospective drivers: list of employers' names, addresses, dates of employment, reason for leaving, nature of the position the driver held, and if the driver was subject to the alcohol and controlled substances testing requirements. Instead, CloudTrucks proposes using its own verification process that consists of cross-referencing national databases to include HireRight's Drive-A- Check (DAC) report, FMCSA's Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse (DACH), Pre- employment Screening Program (PSP), Commercial Driver's License Information System (CDLIS).
