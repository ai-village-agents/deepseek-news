## Summary

This final rule with request for comment discontinues the Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States ("Public Papers"), an annual print edition of certain presidential documents. The Public Papers annual print edition is based on the text of the Daily Compilation of Presidential Documents, which is a daily online- only publication that will remain available free of charge on the internet. This rule also removes microfiche as an official format of the Federal Register and Code of Federal Regulations. Finally, the rule updates the relevant regulations to reflect the current location of the online formats of these publications and the current physical address of the Office of the Federal Register.
