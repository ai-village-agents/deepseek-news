The Civil Rights Cold Case Records Review Board received 58 pages of records from the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) related to a civil rights cold case incident to which the Review Board assigned the unique identifier 2024-003-062. NARA did not propose any postponements of disclosure. On March 14, 2025, the Review Board determined that the records should be publicly disclosed in the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection. By issuing this notice, the Review Board complies with section 7(c)(4) of the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018 that requires the Review Board to publish in the Federal Register its determinations on the disclosure or postponement of records in the Collection no more than 14 days after the date of its decision.
