## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a revision to the Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District (MDAQMD) portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). The revision concerns definitions that are necessary to implement and enforce local rules that regulate air pollution under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the "Act"). We are also approving the rescission of earlier versions of this rule from the California SIP as they are no longer needed under the CAA.
