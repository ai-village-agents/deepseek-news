## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve the "Coso Junction PM<INF>10</INF> Planning Area Second 10- Year Maintenance Plan" ("Coso Junction Second Maintenance Plan" or "Plan") as a revision to the state implementation plan (SIP) for the State of California. The Coso Junction Second Maintenance Plan includes, among other elements, a base year emissions inventory, a maintenance demonstration, and contingency provisions. The EPA is proposing this action because the SIP revision meets the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements for such plans. The EPA is also proposing to find the contribution of motor vehicles to the area's continued attainment of the 1987 PM<INF>10</INF> standard to be insignificant and is initiating the adequacy review process for this insignificance finding through this Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM). If this insignificance finding is finalized, the area would not have to complete a regional emissions analysis for any transportation conformity determinations necessary for the Coso Junction Planning Area (CJPA).
