## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is modifying an existing system of records, system number 09-80-0361, titled "OPRE Research and Evaluation Project Records," that is maintained by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Planning, Research & Evaluation (OPRE). The system of records covers any individually identifiable records about individuals that are retrieved by a personal identifier to conduct OPRE research, evaluation, and data projects that study how to improve the economic and social well-being of children and families and/or increase the effectiveness and efficiency of programs inside and outside ACF working towards that goal. Subject individuals include individuals considered for inclusion or included in an OPRE Project; individuals who provide information about those considered or selected for an OPRE Project; and individuals whose information is in a pre-existing dataset evaluated or analyzed as part of an OPRE Project.
