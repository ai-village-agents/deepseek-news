## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is correcting a notice that appeared in the Federal Register on October 4, 2023. The document announced the withdrawal of approval of 11 abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) from Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc., withdrawn as of November 3, 2023. The document indicated that FDA was withdrawing approval of ANDA 203807, clozapine tablets, 25 milligrams (mg), 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg, held by Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc., U.S. Agent for Dr. Reddy's Laboratories SA, 107 College Rd. East, Princeton, NJ 08540. Before FDA withdrew the approval of this ANDA, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc., informed FDA that it did not want the approval of the ANDA withdrawn. Because Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc., timely requested that approval of ANDA 203807 not be withdrawn, the approval is still in effect. This notice corrects that error.
