## Summary

HRSA is considering recommending to the Secretary the addition of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP). HRSA is providing notice and requesting comments from the public on this potential recommendation. Conditions listed on the RUSP are part of the evidence-informed preventive health guidelines supported by HRSA for infants and children. Non- grandfathered health plans are required to cover screenings included in the HRSA-supported comprehensive guidelines without cost-sharing (e.g., co-payment, co-insurance, etc.). HRSA is particularly interested in comments that address the potential benefit of early screening of DMD within the newborn period, the ability of state newborn screening programs to screen for DMD, and the availability of effective treatments for DMD. In deciding whether to provide recommendations to the Secretary supporting the addition of DMD to the RUSP, HRSA will consider public comments, including evidence-based reports, obtained through this notice.
