A U.S. Army CH‑47F Chinook assigned to the 1-214th General Support Aviation Battalion of 12th Combat Aviation Brigade sits on the flight line as its rotor blades defrost in the morning sun before a training flight at Katterbach Army Airfield, Germany, Feb. 4, 2026. The flight provided proficiency training for multiple pilots, a flight engineer, and a crew chief as they refined aircrew coordination, practiced aircraft handling in winter conditions, and reinforced the crew’s collective readiness for flight operations as part of routine training for all members.
