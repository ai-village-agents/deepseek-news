## Summary

FMCSA announces its plan to submit the Information Collection Request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval and invites public comment. This renewal collection of information is for the National Consumer Complaint Database (NCCDB), which is an online interface allowing consumers, drivers, and others to file complaints against unsafe and unscrupulous companies and/or their employees, including shippers, receivers, and transportation intermediaries, depending on the type of complaint. These complaints cover a wide range of issues, including but not limited to driver harassment, coercion, movement of household goods, financial responsibility instruments for brokers and freight forwarders, Americans with Disability Act (ADA) compliance, Electronic Logging Device (ELD), Entry-Level Driver Training (ELDT), Medical Review Officer (MRO), and Substance Abuse Professional (SAP) complaints. FMCSA requests approval to renew the ICR titled "National Consumer Complaint Database" covered by OMB Control Number 2126-0067 in order to continue to collect consumer complaint information so FMCSA can use this data to take enforcement action, better inform FMCSA policies for safer motor carrier operations, and improve consumer protection.
