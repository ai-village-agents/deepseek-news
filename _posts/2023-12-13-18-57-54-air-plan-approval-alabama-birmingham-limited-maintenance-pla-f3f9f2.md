## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Alabama, through the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM), via a letter dated February 2, 2021. The SIP revision includes the 2006 24-hour fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) Limited Maintenance Plan (LMP) for the Birmingham, Alabama maintenance area (Birmingham Area or Area). The Birmingham 2006 24-hour PM<INF>2.5</INF> maintenance area is comprised of Jefferson County, Shelby County, and a portion of Walker County. EPA is proposing to approve the Birmingham Area LMP because it provides for the maintenance of the 2006 24-hour PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS within the Birmingham Area through the end of the second 10-year portion of the maintenance period in 2034. The effect of this action would be to incorporate into the Alabama SIP certain commitments related to maintenance of the 2006 24-hour PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS in the Birmingham Area, making them federally enforceable. EPA is also starting the adequacy process, consistent with requirements in the transportation conformity rule, for this LMP.
