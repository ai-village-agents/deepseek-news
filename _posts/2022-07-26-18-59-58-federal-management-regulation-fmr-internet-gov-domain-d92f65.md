## Summary

This final rule adopts without changes the interim rule published January 10, 2022, which implemented provisions of the DOTGOV Online Trust in Government Act of 2020 ("DOTGOV") applicable to GSA that transfer ownership, management and operation of the DotGov Domain Program from the General Services Administration (GSA) to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).
