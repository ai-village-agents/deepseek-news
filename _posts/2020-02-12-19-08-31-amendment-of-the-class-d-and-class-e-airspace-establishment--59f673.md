## Summary

This action modifies the Class D airspace and Class E surface airspace at Bowman Field, Louisville, KY; establishes Class E surface airspace designated as an extension to a Class C surface area at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport, Louisville, KY; revokes the Class E airspace designated as an extension to a Class D or Class E surface area at Bowman Field Airport; and modifies the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport and Bowman Field Airport. This action is due to an airspace review caused by the decommissioning of the Bowman VHF omnidirectional range (VOR), which provided navigation information to the instrument procedures at this airport, as part of the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program. The name of the Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport is also being updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
