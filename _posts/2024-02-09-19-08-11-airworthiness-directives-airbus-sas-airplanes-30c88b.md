## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-21-02, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A318, A319, A320, A321, A330-200, A330-200 Freighter, A330-300, A330-800, A330-900, A340- 200, A340-300, A340-500, A340-600, and A380-800 series airplanes. AD 2021-21-02 requires replacing certain parts manufacturer approval (PMA) Ni-Cd batteries with serviceable Ni-Cd batteries or maintaining the electrical storage capacity of those PMA Ni-Cd batteries during airplane storage or parking. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-21-02, it was determined that the on-wing preservation procedures originally provided in that AD did not ensure the expected preservation of the battery capacity. This proposed AD would add airplanes to the applicability and would require replacing each affected part with a serviceable part before release to service of an airplane after a storage or parking period, as applicable. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
