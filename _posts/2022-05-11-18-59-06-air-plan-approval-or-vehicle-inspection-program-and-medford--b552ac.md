## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the Oregon state implementation plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Oregon (Oregon) on December 9, 2020 and December 22, 2021. The revisions update the SIP-approved vehicle inspection program for the Portland and Medford areas. The EPA is proposing to approve the SIP submittal as consistent with Clean Air Act (Act or CAA) requirements. Additionally, EPA is proposing to make a technical correction to the Medford-Ashland particulate matter (PM<INF>10</INF>) maintenance plan that incorrectly identified a street-sweeping commitment as a transportation control measure (TCM).
