## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled "Q9(R1) Quality Risk Management." The draft guidance was prepared under the auspices of the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH), formerly the International Conference on Harmonisation. The current Q9 guideline published in 2006 provides a common, harmonized framework for Quality Risk Management (QRM) that can enable more effective and consistent risk-based decisions, both by regulators and industry, regarding the quality of drug substances and drug products across the product lifecycle. This draft guidance is a targeted revision that addresses four areas for improvement, including high levels of subjectivity in risk assessments and in QRM outputs; product availability risks; lack of understanding as to what constitutes formality in QRM work; and lack of clarity on risk-based decision-making. The revisions are intended to update the original Q9 guideline based on implementation experience to promote improved lifecycle management of hazards and prevent defects, recalls, and shortages.
