## Summary

In the Federal Register of December 10, 2024, EPA issued a proposed rule to revoke all tolerances for residues of chlorpyrifos, except for those associated with the use of chlorpyrifos on the following crops: alfalfa, apple, asparagus, tart cherry, citrus, cotton, peach, soybean, strawberry, sugar beet, and spring and winter wheat. The proposal also addresses the request to revoke all chlorpyrifos tolerances contained in the September 12, 2007, petition submitted by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and Pesticide Action Network North America (PANNA).
