## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), reopen the public comment period on the proposed rule to list the Panama City crayfish (Procambarus econfinae) as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act); propose a rule issued under section 4(d) of the Act ("4(d) rule") for the species; and propose to designate critical habitat for the Panama City crayfish under the Act. In total, approximately 7,177 acres (2,904 hectares) in Bay County, Florida, fall within the boundaries of the proposed critical habitat designation, all of which are currently occupied by the species. We also announce the availability of a draft economic analysis (DEA) for the proposed designation of critical habitat for the Panama City crayfish. We will accept comments on the proposed listing, 4(d) rule, and critical habitat designation, as well as the draft economic analysis, during the open comment period. Finally, we announce a public informational meeting and public hearing on the proposed listing rule and this proposed rule.
