## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE" or "the Department") is publishing a final rule to establish energy conservation standards for manufactured housing pursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. This document presents standards based on the 2021 version of the International Energy Conservation Code ("IECC") and comments received during interagency consultation with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, as well as from stakeholders. The adopted standards would provide a set of "tiered" standards based on size that would apply the 2021 IECC-based standards to manufactured homes, except that single-section manufactured homes would be subject to less stringent building thermal envelope requirements compared to multi-section manufactured homes.
