## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") proposes to amend the Federal test procedure for central air conditioners and heat pumps ("CAC/HPs") to incorporate by reference the latest versions of the applicable industry standards. Specifically, DOE proposes: to amend the current test procedure for CAC/HPs ("appendix M1") for measuring the current cooling and heating metrics--seasonal energy efficiency ratio 2 ("SEER2") and heating seasonal performance factor 2 ("HSPF2"), respectively; and to establish a new test procedure ("appendix M2") for CAC/HPs that would adopt two new metrics--seasonal cooling and off- mode rating efficiency ("SCORE") and seasonal heating and off-mode rating efficiency ("SHORE"). Testing to the SCORE and SHORE metrics would not be required until such time as compliance is required with any amended energy conservation standard based on the new metrics. Additionally, DOE proposes to amend certain provisions of DOE's regulations related to representations and enforcement for CAC/HPs. DOE welcomes written comments from the public on any subject within the scope of this document (including relevant topics not raised in this proposal), as well as the submission of data and other relevant information.
