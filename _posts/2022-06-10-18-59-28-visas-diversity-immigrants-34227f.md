## Summary

The Department of State ("Department") is removing from the Code of Federal Regulations amendments that were published in an interim final rule ("IFR") on June 5, 2019, requiring principal entrants submitting an electronic diversity visa entry form to provide certain information, including the entrant's unique serial or issuance number associated with the principal entrant's valid, unexpired passport or claim an exemption to the passport requirement. This document responds to a ruling of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, which vacated the rule.
