## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain General Electric Company (GE) GEnx-1B and GEnx-2B model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by the detection of melt-related freckles in the forgings and billets, which may reduce the life of certain compressor discharge pressure (CDP) seals, interstage seals, high-pressure turbine (HPT) rotor stage 2 disks, and stages 6-10 compressor rotor spools. This AD requires revising the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the applicable GEnx-1B and GEnx-2B Engine Manual (EM) and the operator's existing approved maintenance program or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate reduced life limits for these parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
