## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain General Electric Company (GE) Model CF34-8C1, CF34-8C5, CF34-8C5A1, CF34-8C5A2, CF34-8C5B1, CF34-8E2, CF34-8E2A1, CF34-8E5, CF34-8E5A1, CF34-8E5A2, CF34-8E5A2HA, CF34-8E6, and CF34-8E6A1 engines. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of in-flight "Engine Degraded" messages from the engine indicating and crew alerting system (EICAS) due to corrosion of the variable geometry (VG) system actuator. This proposed AD would require removing certain electronic engine control (EEC) full authority digital electronic control (FADEC) software versions from service and installing an updated EEC FADEC software that is eligible for installation. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
