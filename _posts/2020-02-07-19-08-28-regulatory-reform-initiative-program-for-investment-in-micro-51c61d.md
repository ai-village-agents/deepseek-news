## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA or Agency) is proposing to revise one regulation and remove 19 regulations from the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) related to the Program for Investment in Microentrepreneurs (PRIME) that are repetitive and unnecessary because they duplicate identical guidance and requirements already stipulated in other legal sources and/or provided to grant applicant and recipients in the annual PRIME funding opportunity announcement. The removal of these regulations will assist the public by simplifying SBA's regulations in the CFR and reducing the amount of time grant applicants and recipients must spend reviewing programmatic guidance.
