## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that an interference was detected between the installed nut and the foot radius of frame (FR) 96, between stringer 6 and stringer 7, on the right-hand side. This proposed AD would require removing the affected fasteners and inspecting the affected area for damage, and applicable corrective actions if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
