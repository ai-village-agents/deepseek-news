## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for certain waters of the Columbia River. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of participants and the maritime public during a high-speed boat race. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit non-participant persons and vessel from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Columbia River or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
