## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff accepts, dockets, and is considering an application for the renewal of Facility Operating License No. R-33, submitted by GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy Americas, LLC (the licensee), dated November 19, 2020, as supplemented. The renewed license would authorize the licensee to operate the GE- Hitachi Nuclear Test Reactor at a maximum steady-state thermal power of 100 kilowatts for an additional 20 years from the date of issuance. The GE-Hitachi Nuclear Test Reactor is located at the GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, Vallecitos Nuclear Center in Sunol, California. Because this application contains sensitive unclassified non-safeguards information (SUNSI), an order imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI for contention preparation.
