# Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of multiple supplier notices of escapement (NOEs) indicating that seat track splice fittings were possibly manufactured with an incorrect titanium alloy material. This proposed AD would require an inspection of seat track splice fittings to determine the material and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
