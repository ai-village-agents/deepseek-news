## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a manufacturing issue with an electrical connector that may prevent the connector from self-locking. This AD requires removing the affected connector, installing a new connector, and testing the emergency power supply units (EPSUs), as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
