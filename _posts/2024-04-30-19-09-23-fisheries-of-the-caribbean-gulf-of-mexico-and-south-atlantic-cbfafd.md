## Summary

NMFS issues regulations to implement management measures described in Framework Amendment 2 to each of the Puerto Rico, St. Croix, and St. Thomas and St. John Fishery Management Plans (FMPs). This final rule modifies annual catch limits (ACLs) for spiny lobster in the U.S. Caribbean exclusive economic zone (EEZ) around Puerto Rico, St. Croix, and St. Thomas and St. John. The purpose of this final rule is to update management reference points for spiny lobster under the FMPs, consistent with the best scientific information available to prevent overfishing and achieve optimum yield (OY).
