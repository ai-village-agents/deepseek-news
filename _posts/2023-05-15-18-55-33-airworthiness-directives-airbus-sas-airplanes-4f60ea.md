## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-17-09, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and - 1041 airplanes. AD 2022-17-09 continues to require the actions of AD 2021-16-03 and requires a modification to restore two independent layers of lightning strike protection. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-17- 09, a determination was made that additional airplanes need to perform a modification to restore the two independent layers of lightning strike protection on the wing lower or upper cover. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2022-17-09 and would require restoring the two independent layers of lightning strike protection, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
