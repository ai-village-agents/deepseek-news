## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the DoD is modifying and reissuing a current Department-wide system of records titled, "Defense Reasonable Accommodation and Assistive Technology Records," DoD-0007. This system of records was originally established to collect and maintain records concerning DoD civilian employees and other members of the public requesting or receiving disability-related accommodations. Additionally, this system was established to collect and maintain records concerning wounded, ill and injured Service members on Active Duty requesting or receiving assistive technology solutions. These accommodations, which relate to enabling civilian employees, members of the public, and certain Service members to access DoD employment, systems, facilities, and programs are hereafter referred to collectively as "accessibility accommodations." This SORN is being updated to expand coverage to DoD civilian and military personnel, and applicants for DoD employment, who request an exemption from generally applicable policies for reasons relating to individual medical conditions, religious beliefs or practices, or matters of conscience. The DoD is also modifying various other sections within the SORN to improve clarity or update information that has changed.
