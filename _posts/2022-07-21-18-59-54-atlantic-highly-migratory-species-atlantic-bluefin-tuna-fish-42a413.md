## Summary

NMFS is transferring 30 metric tons (mt) of Atlantic bluefin tuna (BFT) quota from the Reserve category to the Harpoon category. With this transfer, the adjusted Harpoon category quota for the 2022 fishing season is 78.7 mt. The 2022 Harpoon category fishery is open until November 15, 2022, or until the Harpoon category quota is reached, whichever comes first. This action is intended to provide further opportunities for Harpoon category fishermen, based on consideration of the regulatory determination criteria regarding inseason adjustments and applies to Atlantic Tunas Harpoon category (commercial) permitted vessels.
