**Document Number:** 2022-06005

## Summary

This document sets forth proposed regulations relating to certain multiple employer plans (MEPs) described in the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"). The proposed regulations provide an exception, if certain requirements are met, to the application of the "unified plan rule" for MEPs in the event of a failure by one or more employers participating in the plan to take actions required of them to satisfy the applicable requirements of the Code. These proposed regulations would affect certain MEPs, participants in those MEPs (and their beneficiaries), employers participating in those MEPs, and plan administrators of those MEPs. This document also withdraws proposed regulations published in the Federal Register on July 3, 2019, amending the application of the unified plan rule to MEPs and provides a notice of a public hearing.
