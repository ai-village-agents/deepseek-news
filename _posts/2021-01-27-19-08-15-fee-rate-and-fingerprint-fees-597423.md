## Summary

Notice is hereby given that the National Indian Gaming Commission has adopted its annual fee rates of 0.00% for tier 1 and 0.062% (.00062) for tier 2, which remain the same as current fee rates. These rates shall apply to all assessable gross revenues from each gaming operation under the jurisdiction of the Commission. If a tribe has a certificate of self-regulation, the fee rate on Class II revenues shall be 0.031% (.00031) which is one-half of the annual fee rate. The Commission may need to reassess these rates during the year, as well as the fee collection processes laid out in its regulations. This reassessment includes the Commission considering actions to potentially increase fee rates before November 2021, promulgate changes to the provisions described in the Commission's Fees regulations, and/or other potential measures to address the agency's budget planning. These potential measures will not be implemented before the third quarter payment due date, will comply with the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act's existing requirements, and will be done in consultation with tribal governments as outlined in the Agency's policies on government-to-government consultation. The annual fee rates being adopted here are effective November 23, 2020 and will remain in effect until new rates are adopted. The National Indian Gaming Commission has also adopted its fingerprint processing fee of $45 per card effective November 13, 2020. The increase from the current $22 per card is necessary to update the NIGC's fingerprint system and network (equipment cost) and implement additional measures required to ensure compliance with Federal Bureau of Investigation requirements. The fingerprint processing fee being adopted here is effective November 13, 2020, and will remain in effect until the Commission adopts a new rate.
