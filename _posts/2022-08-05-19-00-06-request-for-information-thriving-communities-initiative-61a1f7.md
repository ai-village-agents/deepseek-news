## Summary

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) enacted as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) created several new programs at the US Department of Transportation (DOT) that allow local governments, non-profit organizations, tribal governments, and other political subdivisions of state or local governments to apply directly for DOT discretionary grant funding. In response to President Biden's Executive Orders, "Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government," and "Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad," DOT has included criteria in its notices of funding opportunity to prioritize the needs of disadvantaged communities for many of these new programs. Through this Request for Information (RFI) for the newly created Thriving Communities Initiative, DOT is looking to gain information on the technical assistance, planning, and capacity building needs faced by disadvantaged communities that are seeking to advance local transportation projects within the existing Federal, state, and regional transportation planning and project delivery methods including to access innovative finance programs offered through DOT.
