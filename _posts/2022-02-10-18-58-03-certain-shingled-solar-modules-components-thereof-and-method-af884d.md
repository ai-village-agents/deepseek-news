## Summary

Notice is hereby given that, on October 22, 2021, the presiding acting chief administrative law judge ("ALJ") issued a combined final initial determination ("ID") finding a violation of section 337 and a recommended determination ("RD") on remedy and bonding in the above-captioned investigation. The Commission has determined to review the final ID in part. The Commission has also determined to remand the ID in part to the ALJ to make a determination regarding whether an on-sale bar applies to the asserted claims of U.S. Patent No. 10,651,333 ("the '333 patent") based on alleged sales and offers for sale of certain products. The Commission requests briefing from the parties, interested government agencies, and interested persons on the issues of remedy, the public interest, and bonding.
