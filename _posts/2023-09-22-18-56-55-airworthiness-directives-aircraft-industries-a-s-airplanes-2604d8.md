## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Aircraft Industries, a.s. Model L-420, L 410 UVP-E20, and L 410 UVP-E20 CARGO airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of the pressure plates within the main landing gear (MLG) wheel brake unit malfunctioning. This AD requires replacing certain MLG wheel brake units with serviceable parts and prohibits installing an affected part on any airplane. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
