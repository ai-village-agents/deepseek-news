## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), notify the public that we are requesting new information to develop a species status assessment (SSA) for the Northern California-Southern Oregon (NCSO) distinct population segment (DPS) of fisher (Pekania pennanti). We plan to initiate a status review to determine whether the NCSO DPS of fisher is warranted for listing as an endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). We request new information since 2019 regarding the NCSO DPS of fisher to inform our SSA. Per a court-approved settlement agreement, we will submit a new final listing determination to the Federal Register on or before August 21, 2025.
