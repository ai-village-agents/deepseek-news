## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing Revision 2 of Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.156, "Qualification of Connection Assemblies for Production and Utilization Facilities." This revised guide was updated to endorse "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers" Std. 572-2019 to provide the latest technical information on approaches to satisfy the qualification requirements for connection assemblies. This includes guidance that when used in conjunction with the guidance in RG 1.89, "Environmental Qualification of Certain Electric Equipment Important to Safety for Nuclear Power Plants," provides an acceptable method of demonstrating compliance with the NRC regulations pertaining to the environmental qualification of connectors, terminations, and environmental seals in combination with cables or wires as assemblies for service in production and utilization facilities to ensure that the connection assemblies can perform their safety functions. Further, the revised guide modifies the title of the RG to include other nuclear facilities, as discussed in the RG Section A, under Applicability.
