## Summary

This notice announces the availability of the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS), which examines the potential impacts of a proposal by the General Services Administration (GSA) to address long-term housing for the tenants of the Chet Holifield Federal Building (CHFB) either through lease relocation or a combination of new construction and lease relocation; as well as the disposal of the CHFB out of federal ownership. The CHFB is owned and managed by GSA and is home to various federal agency tenants, with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) serving as the largest tenant. The FEIS describes the reason for the project; alternatives considered; potential environmental impacts; avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures; includes responses to comments received on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement; and identifies the Preferred Alternative. GSA is serving as the lead agency in this undertaking, and acting on behalf of its tenants at this facility.
