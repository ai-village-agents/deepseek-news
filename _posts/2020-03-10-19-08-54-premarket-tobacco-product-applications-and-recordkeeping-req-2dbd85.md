## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency) is reopening the comment period only for the agency information collection activity associated with proposed rulemaking entitled "Premarket Tobacco Product Applications and Recordkeeping Requirements," which appeared in the Federal Register of September 25, 2019. FDA is not reopening the comment period associated with any other aspects of the proposed rulemaking. The Agency is taking this action to seek comment on an additional proposed form to collect information that would be required under certain provisions of the proposed rule. This proposed form would allow for easier identification of each new tobacco product contained in a grouped submission of premarket tobacco product applications (PMTAs). FDA is reopening the comment period only on the proposed agency information collection activity to allow interested persons additional time to submit comments on this form.
