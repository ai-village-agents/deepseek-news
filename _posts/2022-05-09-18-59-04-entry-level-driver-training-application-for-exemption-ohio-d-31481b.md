## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to deny the Ohio Department of Education's (ODE) request for an exemption from the Entry-Level Driver Training (ELDT) requirements. The exemption request applies to drivers, trained through ODE's "Pre-Service School Bus Driver Training" curriculum, who are seeking to obtain their Class B Commercial Driver's License (CDL) with school bus (S), passenger (P), and air brake endorsements and to current Class B CDL holders wishing to add the P and S endorsements. The ODE believes the Ohio theory (i.e., classroom) curriculum and behind-the-wheel (BTW) instruction meet or exceeds all the standards of the 49 CFR 380 subpart F, ELDT requirements. FMCSA analyzed the exemption application and public comments and determined that the application provided no evidence that the exemption would ensure a level of safety equivalent to or greater than that achieved absent such exemption.
