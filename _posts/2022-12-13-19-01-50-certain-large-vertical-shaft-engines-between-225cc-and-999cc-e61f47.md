## Summary

The U.S Department of Commerce (Commerce) is conducting the administrative review of the antidumping duty order on certain large vertical shaft engines between 225cc and 999cc, and parts thereof (large vertical shaft engines) from the People's Republic of China (China). The period of review (POR) is August 19, 2020, through February 28, 2022. Commerce preliminarily determines that Honda Power Products (China) Co., Ltd. (Honda) failed to establish its eligibility for a separate rate and, therefore, is part of the China-wide entity. We are also rescinding this review with respect to Chongqing Rato Technology Co., Ltd. (Chongqing Rato) and Loncin Motor Co., Ltd (Loncin). We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.
