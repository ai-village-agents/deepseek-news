## Summary

The U.S. Agency for International Development is correcting a final rule rescission that was published in the Federal Register on April 9, 2021. This rule rescinded the regulation published on January 5, 2021, titled "Procedures for the review and clearance of USAID's Guidance Documents," to comply with the Executive order (E.O.) titled "Revocation of Certain Executive Orders Concerning Federal Regulation," signed on January 20, 2021, which specifically requires the revocation of the E.O. titled "Promoting the Rule of Law Through Improved Agency Guidance Documents," signed on October 9, 2019. In the final rule, the date for the E.O. "Promoting the Rule of Law Through Improved Agency Guidance Documents," year was incorrect. This document corrects that error.
