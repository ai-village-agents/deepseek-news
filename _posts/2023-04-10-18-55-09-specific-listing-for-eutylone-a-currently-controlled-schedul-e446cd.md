## Summary

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is establishing a specific listing and DEA Controlled Substances Code Number (drug code) for 1-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-2-(ethylamino)butan-1-one (also known as eutylone or bk-EBDB) in schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Although eutylone is not specifically listed in schedule I of the CSA with its own unique drug code, it has been controlled in the United States since March 7, 2014, as a positional isomer of pentylone, a schedule I hallucinogen. Therefore, DEA is simply amending the schedule I hallucinogenic substances list in its regulations to separately include eutylone.
