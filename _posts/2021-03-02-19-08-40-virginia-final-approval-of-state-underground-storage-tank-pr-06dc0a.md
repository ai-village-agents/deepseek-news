## Summary

Pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965, as amended (commonly known as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking direct final action to approve revisions to the Commonwealth of Virginia's Underground Storage Tank (UST) program submitted by the Commonwealth of Virginia (Virginia or State). This action also codifies EPA's approval of Virginia's state program and incorporates by reference (IBR) those provisions of Virginia's regulations and statutes that EPA has determined meet the requirements for approval. The provisions will be subject to EPA's inspection and enforcement authorities under sections 9005 and 9006 of RCRA Subtitle I and other applicable statutory and regulatory provisions.
