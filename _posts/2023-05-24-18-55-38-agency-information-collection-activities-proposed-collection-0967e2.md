## Summary

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, invites the general public and other Federal Agencies to take this opportunity to comment on an extension, without change, of a currently approved information collection. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice seeks comments concerning the FEMA Preparedness Grants: Tribal Homeland Security Grant Program (THSGP). The THSGP investment justification allows Indian Tribes to apply for Federal funding to support efforts to achieve target capabilities related to preventing, preparing for, protecting against, or responding to acts of terrorism.
