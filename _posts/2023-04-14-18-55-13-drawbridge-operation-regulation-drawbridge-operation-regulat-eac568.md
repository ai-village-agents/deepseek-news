## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to temporarily change the operating schedule that governs the E-182 Main Street Bridge, mile 278.93, over the Erie Canal, in Brockport, NY to allow contractors to rehabilitate the bridge. The roadway has been closed since last fall and vehicles are unable to cross the bridge until repairs are completed. New York Department of Transportation has made this request to temporarily modify the bridge operations to allow for the required maintenance. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
