## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain ATR--GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42-500 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of interference between bonding braid screws and pitch tab control rods on the ATR final assembly line. This AD requires an inspection of the bonding braid screws for proper installation, a detailed inspection for damage to the pitch tab control rods if necessary, and replacement of the pitch tab control rods if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
