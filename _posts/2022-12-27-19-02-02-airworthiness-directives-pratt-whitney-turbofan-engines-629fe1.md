# Airworthiness Directives; Pratt & Whitney Turbofan Engines

## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Pratt & Whitney (PW) PW1519G, PW1521G, PW1521G-3, PW1521GA, PW1524G, PW1524G-3, PW1525G, and PW1525G-3 model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by an uncommanded dual engine shutdown upon landing, resulting in compromised braking capability due to the loss of engine power and hydraulic systems. This AD requires removal from service of certain electronic engine control (EEC) full authority digital engine control (FADEC) software versions and replacement with updated software. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
