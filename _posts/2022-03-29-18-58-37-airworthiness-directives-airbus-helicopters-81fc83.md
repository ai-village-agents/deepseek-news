## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model AS355E, AS355F, AS355F1, AS355F2, AS- 365N2, AS 365 N3, SA-365N, SA-365N1, EC 155B, and EC155B1 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by investigation results from an engine compartment fire, which determined some of the internal parts of the engine upper fixed cowling (engine cowling) were painted with finish paint on top of the primer layer. This proposed AD would require a one- time inspection of certain part-numbered engine cowlings, and corrective actions if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
