## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) TAY 620-15 and TAY 650-15 model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by reports of cracks on the high-pressure turbine (HPT) stage 2 intermediate air seal attachment bolts (attachment bolts). This AD requires repetitive inspections of the HPT stage 2 intermediate air seal and attachment bolts and, depending on the results of the inspections, replacement of attachment bolts and the HPT stage 1 and stage 2 rotor disks, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
