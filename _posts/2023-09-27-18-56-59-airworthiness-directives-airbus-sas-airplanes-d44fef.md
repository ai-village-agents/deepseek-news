## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-07-15, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A318, A319, A320, and A321 series airplanes. AD 2022-07-15 requires replacing affected braking and steering control units (BSCUs) and revising the operator's existing FAA-approved minimum equipment list (MEL). Since the FAA issued AD 2022-07-15, a type 1 relay combined with an affected BSCU would induce BSCU freezing. This proposed AD would remove certain airplanes from the applicability, retain the requirements of AD 2022- 07-15, require an inspection for the relay type installed and replacement of type 1 relays with type 2 relays, and prohibit the installation of affected relays at certain locations, limit the installation of affected BSCUs on certain airplanes, and prohibit the installation of affected BSCUs for certain other airplanes, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
