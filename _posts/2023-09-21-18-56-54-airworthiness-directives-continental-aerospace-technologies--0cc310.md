## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-04-04 for certain Continental Aerospace Technologies, Inc. (Continental) Model C-125, C145, IO-360, IO-470, IO-550, O-300, O-470, TSIO-360, and TSIO-520 series engines and certain Continental Motors IO-520 series engines with a certain oil filter adapter installed. AD 2022-04-04 required replacing the oil filter adapter fiber gasket (fiber gasket) with an oil filter adapter copper gasket (copper gasket). This AD was prompted by reports of two accidents that were the result of power loss due to oil starvation. This AD requires replacing the fiber gasket with a copper gasket or a stainless steel embedded within polytetrafluoroethylene gasket (stainless steel PTFE gasket). This AD also revises the applicability to include Continental model engines equipped with an F&M Enterprises, Inc. (F&M) or a Stratus Tool Technologies, LLC (Stratus) oil filter adapter installed. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
