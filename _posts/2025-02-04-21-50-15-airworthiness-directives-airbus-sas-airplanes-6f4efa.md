## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A300 B4-601, B4-603, B4-620, B4-622, B4-605R, B4-622R, C4-605R Variant F, F4-605R, and F4-622R airplanes; Model A310 series airplanes; Model A318, A319, A320, and A321 series airplanes; Model A330-200, -200 Freighter, and -300 series airplanes; Model A330-841 and -941 airplanes; and Model A340-211, -212, -213, -311, -312, -313, -541, and -642 airplanes. This AD was prompted by chemical oxygen generators that failed to activate in service and during maintenance activities. This AD requires replacing affected oxygen generators and prohibits the installation of affected parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
