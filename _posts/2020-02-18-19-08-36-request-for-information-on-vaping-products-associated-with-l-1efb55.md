## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is opening a docket to obtain data and information related to the use of vaping products that are associated with recent lung injuries. This request for information (RFI) responds to direction from Congress to gather information from the public that could help identify and evaluate additional steps the Agency could take to "address the recent pulmonary illnesses reported to be associated with the use of e-cigarettes and vaping products." FDA is seeking information on product design and potential ways to prevent consumers from modifying or adding substances to these products that are not intended by the manufacturers. In particular, FDA is seeking data and information in the form of reports and manuscripts that are unpublished or not available through indexed bibliographic databases. FDA has searched the publicly available scientific literature and is now seeking to supplement that with information not included in the published scientific literature.
