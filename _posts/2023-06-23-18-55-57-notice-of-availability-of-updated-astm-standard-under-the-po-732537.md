## Summary

In January 2023, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission determined under the Portable Fuel Container Safety Act of 2020 (PFCSA) that ASTM F3429/F3429M-20 is a mandatory consumer product safety rule that impedes the propagation of flames into pre-filled portable fuel containers covered by the standard. ASTM has since notified the Commission that it has revised this voluntary standard. CPSC seeks comment on whether the revision meets the requirements of the PFCSA.
