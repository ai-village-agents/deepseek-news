## Summary

This rule amends the requirements for investing lenders and investing mortgagees to gain or maintain their status as a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) approved lender or mortgagee. This revision makes FHA's approval requirements consistent with investing mortgagees' and investing lenders' risk, reduces barriers to FHA approval for new investing mortgagees and investing lenders, and increases access to capital for all FHA-approved mortgagees and lenders. HUD is clarifying that the general annual certification requirement for lenders and mortgagees is applicable to investing lenders and investing mortgagees. HUD is also defining Government- Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) separately from other governmental-type entities to ensure that FHA requirements specific to loan origination do not apply to GSEs. Finally, HUD is eliminating obsolete language related to lender and mortgagee net worth requirements. This final rule adopts HUD's July 18, 2023, proposed rule with minor revisions.
