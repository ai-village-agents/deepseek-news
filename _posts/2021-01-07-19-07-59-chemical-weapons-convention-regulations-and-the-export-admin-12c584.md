## Summary

The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is publishing this final rule to amend the Chemical Weapons Convention Regulations (CWCR) and the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to reflect recent additions to Schedule 1(A) of the Annex on Chemicals to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, also known as the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). This final rule also amends the definition of "production" in the CWCR to clarify the scope of this term as it applies to declarations regarding the production of "Schedule 1," "Schedule 2," or "Schedule 3" chemicals.
