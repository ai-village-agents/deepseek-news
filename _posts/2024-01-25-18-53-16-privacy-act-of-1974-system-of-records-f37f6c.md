## Summary

Pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (section 522a of title 5 of the United States Code [U.S.C.]), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) proposes to establish a new System of Records titled, "USAID 36: Private Sector Engagement Records." The purpose of the system is to administer USAID's Private Sector Engagement Policy and enhance the risk management activities in support of its trade and investment support services. This System of Records includes a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool that will function as a data warehouse that maintains information on business entities and their representatives that express interest in supporting or potentially supporting USAID's mission in foreign development. This information will be used by USAID to enhance transparency, improve coordination, as well as for monitoring and evaluation by USAID program offices.
