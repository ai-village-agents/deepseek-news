## Summary

FRA proposes to amend its standards for Reflectorization of Rail Freight Rolling Stock (Reflectorization Standards) to codify waivers and remove the outdated implementation schedule. The proposed changes are expected to enhance safety, promote innovation, clarify existing requirements, and reduce unnecessary paperwork burdens. The proposed amendments are consistent with the mandate of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), which requires FRA to review and analyze certain longstanding waivers to determine whether incorporating the waivers into FRA's regulations is justified.
