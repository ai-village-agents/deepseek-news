## Summary

Through this notice, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announces that the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) is extending the designation of Yemen for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 18 months, from March 4, 2020, through September 3, 2021. The extension allows currently eligible TPS beneficiaries to retain TPS through September 3, 2021, so long as they otherwise continue to meet the eligibility requirements for TPS. This notice also sets forth procedures necessary for nationals of Yemen (or aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in Yemen) to re-register for TPS and to apply for Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). USCIS will issue new EADs with a September 3, 2021, expiration date to eligible beneficiaries under Yemen's TPS designation who timely re-register and apply for EADs under this extension.
