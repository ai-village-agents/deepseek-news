## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are listing marron bacora (Solanum conocarpum), a plant species from the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, as an endangered species and are designating critical habitat for the species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). In total, approximately 2,548 acres (1,031 hectares) on St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands, fall within the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. This rule adds this species to the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Plants and extends the Act's protections to the species and its designated critical habitat.
