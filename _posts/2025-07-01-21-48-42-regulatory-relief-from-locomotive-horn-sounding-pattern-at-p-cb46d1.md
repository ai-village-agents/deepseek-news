## Summary

This proposed rule would provide greater flexibility for compliance with FRA's train horn regulation. Specifically, this proposed rule would allow for regulatory relief from the required pattern of sounding the locomotive horn in two long blasts, one short blast, and one long blast where trains, locomotive consists, and individual locomotives have stopped in close proximity to a public highway-rail grade crossing location. This proposed rule would instead allow locomotive engineers to vary the pattern of sounding the locomotive horn to only one single blast of the horn as they enter onto and cross over these grade crossing locations.
