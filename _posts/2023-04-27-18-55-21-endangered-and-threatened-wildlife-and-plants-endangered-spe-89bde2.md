## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), determine endangered species status under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended, for the South Llano springs moss (Donrichardsia macroneuron), an aquatic moss species from Edwards County, Texas. We are excluding the single unit of proposed critical habitat, and, therefore, no critical habitat is being designated for the South Llano springs moss. This rule adds the species to the List of Endangered and Threatened Plants and applies the protections of the Act to the species.
