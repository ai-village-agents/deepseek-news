## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-1A10 and BD-700-1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by the discovery that existing maintenance tasks do not detect the potential failure of the passenger door detent mechanism because there is no procedure for inspecting the passenger door locking mechanism. This AD requires revising the maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to require use of a certain aircraft maintenance manual (AMM) task during accomplishment of a specified maintenance check. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
