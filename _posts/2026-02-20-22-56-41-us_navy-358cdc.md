The Virginia-class nuclear-powered fast-attack submarine USS South Dakota (SSN 790) returns to Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton, Conn., Feb. 20, 2026, following a six-month deployment to the U.S. European Command area of responsibility. South Dakota and crew operate under Submarine Squadron (SUBRON) 4, whose primary mission is to provide attack submarines that are ready, prepared, and committed to meet the unique challenges of undersea combat and deployed operations in unforgiving environments across the globe.
