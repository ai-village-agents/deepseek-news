## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-05- 09, which applied to all Airbus Helicopters Model AS332C, AS332C1, AS332L, and AS332L1 helicopters. AD 2018-05-09 required inspecting the tail rotor (T/R) flapping hinge link (hinge) and reporting the results. This AD requires repetitive inspections of the spindle bolts and the inner ring and needle bearings of each flapping hinge, corrective actions if necessary, and repetitive replacements of affected flapping hinge components, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. Replacement of all affected flapping hinge components on each flapping hinge is terminating action for the repetitive inspections. This AD also expands the applicability. This AD was prompted by a report of a damaged flapping hinge on a T/R blade. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
