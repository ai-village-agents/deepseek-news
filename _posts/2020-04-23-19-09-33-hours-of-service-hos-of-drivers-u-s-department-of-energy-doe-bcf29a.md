## Summary

FMCSA has received an application from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for a renewal of its exemption from the 30-minute rest break provision of the Agency's hours-of-service (HOS) regulations for commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers. DOE currently holds an exemption for the period June 30, 2015, through June 29, 2020, which enables DOE's contract motor carriers and their employee-drivers engaged in the transportation of security-sensitive radioactive materials to be treated similarly to drivers of shipments of explosives. The exemption allows the drivers to use 30 minutes or more of "attendance time" to meet the HOS rest break requirements provided the drivers do not perform any other work during the break. FMCSA requests public comment on the renewal of the exemption.
