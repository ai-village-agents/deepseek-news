## Summary

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (the Department) is issuing this notice of proposed rulemaking to improve the Food and Nutrition Service's (FNS) Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) quality control (QC) system as required in the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (2018 Farm Bill). The proposed changes are intended to strengthen and improve the integrity and accuracy of the SNAP QC system and to better align SNAP with requirements in the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA). These changes include a significant adjustment to the SNAP QC system that involves changes to Federal and State agency sampling processes, as well as changes to the active case review process. Quality Control case sampling and review processes are key aspects of the system used to annually assess SNAP payment error rates. The Department requests comment on this rule's proposed provisions.
