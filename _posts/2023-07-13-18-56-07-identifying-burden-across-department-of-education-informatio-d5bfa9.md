## Summary

The U.S. Department of Education (Department) is seeking comments from the public on how it can reduce the burden associated with its information collection requests (ICRs) on State, local, territorial, and Tribal governments, educational institutions, nonprofits, and individuals, while maintaining data, information, and analyses critical to fulfill the Department's mission. This effort will help the Department identify improvements, redundancies in information collections, and inefficiencies in collections in order to improve the value and use of data.
