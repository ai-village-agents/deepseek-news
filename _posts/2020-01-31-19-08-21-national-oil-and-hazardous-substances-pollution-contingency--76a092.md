## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 8 announces the deletion of the surface and unsaturated subsurface soils outside of the 4.5 acre Treated Soils Area of the Idaho Pole Co. Superfund Site (Site) located in Bozeman, Montana from the National Priorities List (NPL). The NPL, promulgated pursuant to section 105 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980, as amended, is an appendix of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP). This partial deletion pertains to the surface and unsaturated subsurface soils remedy component outside of the 4.5 acre Treated Soils Area of the Idaho Pole Company Superfund Site. The groundwater, sediments and saturated subsurface soils are being addressed as part of the groundwater remedy component and are not being considered for deletion as part of this action. The EPA and the State of Montana, through the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), have determined that all appropriate response actions under CERCLA, other than operation and maintenance, monitoring-and five-year reviews, have been completed. However, the deletion of the surface and unsaturated surface soils outside of the 4.5 acre Treated Soils Area does not preclude future actions under Superfund.
