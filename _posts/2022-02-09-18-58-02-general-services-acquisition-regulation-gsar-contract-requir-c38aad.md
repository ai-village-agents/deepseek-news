## Summary

GSA is amending the General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation (GSAR) to streamline and update requirements for contracts that involve GSA information systems. The revision of GSA's cybersecurity and other information technology requirements will lead to the elimination of a duplicative and outdated provision and clause from the GSAR. The final rule will replace the outdated text with existing policies of the GSA Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) and provide centralized guidance to ensure consistent application across the organization. The updated GSA policy will align cybersecurity requirements based on the items being procured by ensuring contract requirements are coordinated with GSA's Chief Information Security Officer and included in all applicable solicitations and contracts.
