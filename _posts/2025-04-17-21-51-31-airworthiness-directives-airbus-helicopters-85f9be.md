## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Helicopters Model H160-B helicopters. This AD was prompted by reports of difficulty moving the locking fingers when applying the jettisoning function of the windows. This AD requires repetitively lubricating the locking fingers of each jettisonable window, performing an operational test, and depending on the results, performing corrective actions. These actions are specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
