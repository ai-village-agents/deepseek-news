## Summary

The United States Grain Standards Act (USGSA) designations of the official agencies listed in SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION below will end on the prescribed dates. The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is seeking persons or governmental agencies interested in providing official services in the areas presently served by these agencies to apply for designation. Designation provides for private entities or state governmental agencies to be an integral part of the official grain inspection system (https://www.ams.usda.gov/services/fgis/ official-grain-inspection-weighing-system). Designated agencies work under the supervision of the Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) and are authorized to provide official inspection and weighing services in a defined geographic area. In addition, we request comments on the quality of services provided by the following designated agencies: Grain Inspection, Inc. (Jamestown); Lincoln Grain Inspection Service, Inc. (Lincoln); Midsouth Grain Inspection Service (Midsouth); Kansas Grain Inspection Service, Inc. (Kansas); Mid-Iowa Grain Inspection, Inc. (Mid-Iowa); Minot Grain Inspection, Inc. (Minot); Tri-State Grain Inspection, Inc. (Tri-State); Idaho Grain Inspection Service, Inc. (Idaho); Ohio Valley Grain Inspection, Inc. (Ohio Valley); California Agri Inspection Co., Ltd. (California); and Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (Virginia). AMS encourages submissions from traditionally underrepresented individuals, organizations, and businesses to reflect the diversity of this industry. AMS encourages submissions from qualified applicants, regardless of race, color, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, religion, disability status, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law. AMS is also asking for comments on the quality of official services at export port locations provided by delegated state agencies Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (Virginia) and Wisconsin Department of Agriculture (Wisconsin). AMS considers comments and other available information when determining certification.
