## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Helicopters Model AS332L1 and EC225LP helicopters. This AD was prompted by a determination of a possible interference of the hoist operator's helmet cord with the toggle switch of the hoist cable cut control. This AD requires replacing, or modifying and re- identifying, certain hoist shear toggle switch supports, and prohibits installing certain hoist shear toggle switch supports, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
