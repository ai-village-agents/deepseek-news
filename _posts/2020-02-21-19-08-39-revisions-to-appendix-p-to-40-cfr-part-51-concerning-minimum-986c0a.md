## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to update a regulation, Appendix P to 40 CFR part 51 (Appendix P), that specifies what State Implementation Plans (SIPs) must require of sources among four categories with respect to continuous emission monitoring, recording, and reporting. Those four Appendix P source categories are: Fossil fuel-fired steam generators; fluid bed catalytic cracking unit catalyst regenerators at petroleum refineries; sulfuric acid plants; and nitric acid plants. In particular, proposed amendments to Appendix P would revise the minimum frequency for submitting reports of excess emissions from "each calendar quarter" to "twice per year at 6-month intervals." As a result, states may, in their SIPs, establish a semiannual reporting frequency for excess emissions at affected sources that aligns with what the EPA has generally established as the reporting frequency applicable to the Appendix P source categories under more recently updated regulations, such as New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) under 40 CFR part 60. Proposed amendments also include correction of an erroneous cross-reference in Appendix P.
