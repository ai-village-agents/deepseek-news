## Summary

This final rule amends the current test procedure for hot gas defrost unit coolers by making it consistent with a recent update to the industry testing standard that is incorporated by reference in the relevant Federal test procedure for walk-in freezer refrigeration systems. This final rule updates the equations used to calculate defrost energy and heat contributions applicable to these systems to provide a consistent performance evaluation between hot gas defrost and electric defrost unit coolers when tested alone.
