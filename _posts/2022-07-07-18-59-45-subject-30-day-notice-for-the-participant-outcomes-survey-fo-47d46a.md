## Summary

The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, conducts a preclearance consultation program to provide the general public and federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on proposed and/or continuing collections of information in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This program helps to ensure that requested data is provided in the desired format; reporting burden (time and financial resources) is minimized; collection instruments are clearly understood; and the impact of collection requirements on respondents is properly assessed. Currently, the NEA is soliciting comments concerning the proposed information collection through the Participant Outcomes Survey for individuals who participate in community arts programs funded by the Creative Forces[supreg]: NEA Military Healing Arts Network Community Arts Engagement Subgranting Program. Copies of this ICR, with applicable supporting documentation, may be obtained by visiting www.Reginfo.gov.
