## Summary

The NCUA Board (Board) is issuing this advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) to solicit comments on ways the agency can improve and update its records preservation program regulation and accompanying guidelines in the NCUA regulations. The Board is particularly interested in obtaining stakeholder input on the content of the regulation, which has not been updated in 15 years and may be outdated or at odds with current best practices. The Board is also interested in feedback on the structure of the part which may be confusing as it currently contains a combination of regulatory requirements and guidance.
