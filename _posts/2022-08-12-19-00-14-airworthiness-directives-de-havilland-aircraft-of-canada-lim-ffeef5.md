## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited Model DHC-8-402 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by an investigation that found that the actual operating temperatures within the integrated flight cabinet (IFC) were significantly higher than anticipated during certification. This proposed AD would require a design change to improve the integrated flight cabinet (IFC) cooling capacity. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
