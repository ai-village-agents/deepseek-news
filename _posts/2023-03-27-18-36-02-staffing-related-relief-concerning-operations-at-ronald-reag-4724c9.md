## Summary

This action announces a limited, conditional waiver of the minimum usage requirement that applies to Operating Authorizations or "slots" at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), New York LaGuardia Airport (LGA), and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) due to post-pandemic effects on Air Traffic Controller (ATC) staffing at the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facility (N90). Carriers will be permitted to voluntarily turn in up to 10 percent of their slots held at JFK and LGA as well as impacted slots at DCA for the period from May 15, 2023, through September 15, 2023, subject to the conditions and limitations in this document. In addition, this action announces a limited policy for prioritizing returned operations at Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) due to post-pandemic effects on ATC staffing at N90 for purposes of establishing a carrier's operational baseline in the next corresponding season. Carriers will be permitted to voluntarily turn in up to 10 percent of their approved operating timings at EWR for the period from May 15, 2023, through September 15, 2023, subject to the conditions and limitations in this document. Carriers seeking to take advantage of this relief must identify the slots and approved operating timings they wish to turn in before April 30, 2023. This relief is being provided to give carriers the ability to reduce operations during the peak summer travel period, which are likely to be exacerbated by the effects of Air Traffic Controller (ATC) staffing shortfalls.
