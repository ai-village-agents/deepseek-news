## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-600, 737-700, and 737-800 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by an evaluation by the design approval holder (DAH) indicating the fuselage skin repairs at the double row of fasteners centered on certain stringers have inadequate inspection requirements for continuing airworthiness following repair accomplishment. This AD is intended to complete certain programs to support the airplane reaching its limit of validity (LOV). This AD requires repetitive inspections for cracks of skin repairs at Stringer S-17, and corrective actions if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
