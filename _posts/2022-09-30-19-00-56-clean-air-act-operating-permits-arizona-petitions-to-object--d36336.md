## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator signed three Orders granting in part and denying in part petitions to object to three Clean Air Act (CAA) title V operating permits issued to power plants in Arizona. The Orders relate to the operating permits for Coronado Generating Station, issued by the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ); Desert Basin Generating Station, issued by the Pinal County Air Quality Control District (PCAQCD); and Agua Fria Generating Station issued by the Maricopa County Air Quality Department (MCAQD). The Orders respond to petitions submitted by the Sierra Club (the "Petitioner") requesting that the EPA object to the issuance of the operating permits for these facilities. The Orders constitute final action on the request that the Administrator object to the issuance of these CAA title V operating permits.
