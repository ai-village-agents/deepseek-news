# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Canada Limited Partnership (Type Certificate Previously Held by C Series Aircraft Limited Partnership (CSALP); Bombardier, Inc.) Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD- 500-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by the discovery on the production line that the electrical system harnesses in lavatory A had reduced bend radii, were not properly secured, and did not meet the requirement for clearance from an oxygen supply line. This proposed AD would require an inspection of the sleeve and electrical harness for chafing damage and incorrect installation, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
