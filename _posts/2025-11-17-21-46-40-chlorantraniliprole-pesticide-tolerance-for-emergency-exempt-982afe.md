## Summary

This regulation establishes a time-limited tolerance for residues of chlorantraniliprole, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on rice, grain. This action is in response to EPA's granting of an emergency exemption under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) authorizing use of the pesticide on rice. This regulation establishes a maximum permissible level for residues of chlorantraniliprole. The time-limited tolerance expires on December 31, 2028.
