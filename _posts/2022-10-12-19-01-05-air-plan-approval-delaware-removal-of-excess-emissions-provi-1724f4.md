## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve certain portions of a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Delaware, through the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC), on November 22, 2016. The revision was submitted by Delaware in response to a national finding of substantial inadequacy and SIP call published on June 12, 2015, which included certain provisions in the Delaware SIP related to excess emissions during startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) events. EPA is proposing to approve two specific provisions of the submitted SIP revision and proposing to determine that such SIP revision corrects some of the deficiencies in Delaware's SIP identified in the June 12, 2015, SIP call. EPA plans to act on the remainder of the SIP revision in a separate action or actions.
