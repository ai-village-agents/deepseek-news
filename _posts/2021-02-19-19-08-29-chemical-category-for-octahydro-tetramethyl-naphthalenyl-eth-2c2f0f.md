## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the availability of and soliciting public comment on a manufacturer request for a risk evaluation under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) of ethanone, 1-(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octahydro-2,3,5,5-tetramethyl-2- naphthalenyl), ethanone, 1-(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octahydro-2,3,8,8- tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl), ethanone, 1-(1,2,3,4,6,7,8,8a-octahydro- 2,3,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl), and ethanone, 1-(1,2,3,5,6,7,8,8a- octahydro-2,3,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl) (collectively, "OTNE"). The request was made by International Flavors and Fragrances, Inc. (IFF), Privi Organics USA Corporation (Privi), and DRT America, Inc. (DRT) through the OTNE Consortium. EPA conducts risk evaluations to determine whether a chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment without consideration of costs or other non-risk factors, including an unreasonable risk to potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations, under the conditions of use. In the docket associated with this request is the manufacturer request for an EPA-conducted risk evaluation and possible additional conditions of use EPA has identified for inclusion within the scope of a risk evaluation of OTNE. EPA specifically invites public comment on the inclusion of any additional conditions of use and potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations. The Agency is in the process of broadly re-examining how it intends to implement these and other provisions of amended TSCA including determining how new executive orders and other direction provided by the Biden-Harris Administration will be addressed. This process would benefit greatly from stakeholder feedback. After considering comments received in response to this solicitation, EPA will determine whether to grant or deny the manufacturer request. All TSCA risk evaluations, whether EPA-initiated or manufacturer-requested, will be conducted in the same manner.
