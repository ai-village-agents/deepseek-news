## Summary

The Coast Guard announces that it will exercise its authority to suspend and grant exemptions from certain equipment carriage regulations during a period when compliance appears to be impossible. Specifically, the Coast Guard believes that between July 22, 2021, and July 22, 2022, there may be no approved fire detection systems available for purchase for certain vessels that need to install or replace those systems. For enforcement purposes, existing approved fire detection systems that were approved on July 21, 2021, will be treated as approved until July 22, 2022.
