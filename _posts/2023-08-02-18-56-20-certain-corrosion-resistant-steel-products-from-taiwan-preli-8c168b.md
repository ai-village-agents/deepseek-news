## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on certain corrosion-resistant steel products (CORE) from Taiwan. We preliminarily determine that producers/exporters subject to this review did not make sales of subject merchandise at less than normal value during the period of review (POR) July 1, 2021, through June 30, 2022. We further preliminarily determine that Xxentria Technology Materials Company Ltd. (Xxentria) had no shipments during the POR. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.
