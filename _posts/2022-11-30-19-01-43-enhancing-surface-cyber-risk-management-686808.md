## Summary

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is seeking input regarding ways to strengthen cybersecurity and resiliency in the pipeline and rail (including freight, passenger, and transit rail) sectors. This advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) offers an opportunity for interested individuals and organizations, particularly owner/operators of higher-risk pipeline and rail operations, to help TSA develop a comprehensive and forward-looking approach to cybersecurity requirements. TSA is also interested in input from the industry associations representing these owners/operators, third-party cybersecurity subject matter experts, and insurers and underwriters for cybersecurity risks for these transportation sectors. Although TSA will review and consider all comments submitted, we are specifically interested in responses to the questions posed in this ANPRM. Input received in response to this ANPRM will assist TSA in better understanding how the pipeline and rail sectors implement cyber risk management (CRM) in their operations and will support us in achieving objectives related to the enhancement of pipeline and rail cybersecurity.
