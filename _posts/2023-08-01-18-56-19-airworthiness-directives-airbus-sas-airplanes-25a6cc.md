## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-20-05 and AD 2022-09-16, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A318 series; A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, -133, -151N, and -153N; A320 series; and A321 series airplanes. AD 2020-20-05 and AD 2022-09-16 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. This AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2022-09-16, and also requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate additional new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations; as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
