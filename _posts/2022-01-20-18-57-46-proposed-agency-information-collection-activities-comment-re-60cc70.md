## Summary

In accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), the OCC, the Board, and the FDIC (the agencies) may not conduct or sponsor, and the respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), of which the agencies are members, has approved the agencies' publication for public comment of a proposal to revise and extend the Country Exposure Report (FFIEC 009) and the Country Exposure Information Report (FFIEC 009a), which are currently approved collections of information. The revisions to the FFIEC 009 and the FFIEC 009a are proposed to take effect as of the December 31, 2022, report date. At the end of the comment period for this notice, the FFIEC and the agencies will review any comments received to determine whether to modify the proposal in response to comments. As required by the PRA, the agencies will then publish a second Federal Register notice for a 30-day comment period and submit the final FFIEC 009 and FFIEC 009a to OMB for review and approval.
