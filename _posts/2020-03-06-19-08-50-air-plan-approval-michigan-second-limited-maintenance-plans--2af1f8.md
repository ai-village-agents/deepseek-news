## Summary

Pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Michigan. On July 24, 2019, the state submitted the 1997 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) Limited Maintenance Plans (LMPs) for the Benzie County, Flint (Genesee and Lapeer Counties), Grand Rapids (Ottawa and Kent Counties), Huron County, Kalamazoo-Battle Creek (Calhoun, Kalamazoo, and Van Buren Counties), Lansing-East Lansing (Clinton, Eaton, and Ingham Counties), and Mason County areas. EPA is approving these Michigan LMPs because they provide for the maintenance of the 1997 ozone NAAQS through the end of the second 10-year portion of the maintenance period. EPA proposed to approve the submission on December 4, 2019, and received two comments. This approval makes certain commitments related to maintenance of the 1997 ozone NAAQS in these areas federally enforceable as part of the Michigan SIP.
