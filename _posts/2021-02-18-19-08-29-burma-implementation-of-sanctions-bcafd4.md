## Summary

In response to the coup perpetrated by the Burmese military wresting control of the democratically-elected government of Burma, the United States Government is reviewing all available actions to hold the perpetrators of the coup responsible. The Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is taking immediate action to limit exports and reexports of sensitive goods to Burma's military and security services. Effective immediately, BIS is adopting a more restrictive license application review policy of presumption of denial of items requiring a license for export and reexport to Burma's Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Home Affairs, armed forces, and security services. BIS is also suspending the use of certain license exceptions that would otherwise generally be available to Burma as a result of its current Country Group placement in the Export Administration Regulations (EAR).
