## Summary

FMCSA proposes the development and implementation of a Federal appeals process for Requests for Data Review (RDRs) submitted to the Agency through its DataQs system. DataQs is the online system for motor carriers, commercial motor vehicle drivers and other interested parties to request and track a review of Federal and State crash and inspection data submitted to and stored by FMCSA that the requester believes is incomplete or incorrect. The proposed review process would provide users with an opportunity to have their requests reviewed by FMCSA after the request has been reviewed and denied after reconsideration by the State agency. FMCSA would include requirements for ensuring an independent review of all requests. The outcome of the FMCSA review would be deemed final. FMCSA requests public comments on the proposed process.
