## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the United States Department of Transportation proposes to rename, update and reissue a Department of Transportation (DOT) system of records notice titled, "Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration; DOT/ FAA 854 Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) Waivers and Authorizations." The name of the SORN will be changed to "Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Waivers and Authorizations". The modification of the system of records notice (hereafter referred to as "Notice") allows the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to collect and maintain records on individuals operating small unmanned aircraft systems (hereinafter "sUAS") who request and receive authorizations to fly their sUAS in controlled airspace or waivers to fly their sUAS outside of the requirements of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and to review and approve Certificate of Waiver or Authorizations (COA) applications.
