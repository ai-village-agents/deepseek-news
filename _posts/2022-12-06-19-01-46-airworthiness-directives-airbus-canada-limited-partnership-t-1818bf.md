## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500- 1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of mechanical wear damage found on the engine fuel feed system tubes and fuel tube connections. This proposed AD would require repetitive inspections of the fuel feed system for damage and replacement if necessary, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
