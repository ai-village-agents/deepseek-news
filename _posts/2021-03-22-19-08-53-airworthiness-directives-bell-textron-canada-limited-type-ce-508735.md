## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Bell Textron Canada Limited (type certificate previously held by Bell Helicopter Textron Canada Limited) (Bell) Model 505 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by the discovery of a gap between the transmission restraint assembly aft attachment hardware lower washer and mating airframe truss assembly (truss assembly) clevis lower lug. This proposed AD would require inspecting the transmission restraint aft attachment hardware installation for a gap and corrective action depending on the inspection results. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
