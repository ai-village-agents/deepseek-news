## Summary

The FAA is proposing this action due to an airspace review conducted as part of the decommissioning of the Pellston very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimum Operating Network (MON) Program. The geographic coordinates of the airport would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
