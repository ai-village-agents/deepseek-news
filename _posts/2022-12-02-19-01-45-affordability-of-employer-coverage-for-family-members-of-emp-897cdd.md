## Summary

This document includes corrections to the final regulations (Treasury Decision 9968) published in the Federal Register on Thursday, October 13, 2022. This correction contains final regulations under section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) that amend the regulations regarding eligibility for the premium tax credit (PTC) to provide that affordability of employer-sponsored minimum essential coverage (employer coverage) for family members of an employee is determined based on the employee's share of the cost of covering the employee and those family members, not the cost of covering only the employee.
