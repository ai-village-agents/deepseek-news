## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of deep spot faces on rib 9 at the lower flange bolting with the lower spar. This AD requires a special detailed inspection for discrepancies of certain pylon bolts, and applicable corrective actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
