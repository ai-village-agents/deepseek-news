## Summary

The Commission hereby gives notice of the scheduling of full reviews pursuant to the Tariff Act of 1930 ("the Act") to determine whether revocation of the countervailing duty orders on certain cold-drawn mechanical tubing of carbon and alloy steel ("cold-drawn mechanical tubing") from China and India and the antidumping duty orders on cold-drawn mechanical tubing from China, Germany, India, Italy, South Korea, and Switzerland would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury within a reasonably foreseeable time.
