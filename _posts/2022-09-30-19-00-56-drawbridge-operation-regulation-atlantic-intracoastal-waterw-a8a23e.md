## Summary

The Coast Guard has issued a temporary deviation from the operating schedule that governs the West 79th Street Bridge crossing the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway (AICW), mile 1084.6 at Miami, Florida, and the East 79th Street Bridge crossing Miami Beach Channel, mile 2.20 at Miami Beach, Florida. North Bay Village requested the Coast Guard consider placing additional weekday restrictions during rush hour on both drawbridges to assist with alleviating vehicle congestion. This deviation will test a proposed change to the drawbridge operation schedule to determine whether a permanent change to the schedule is needed. The Coast Guard is seeking comments from the public regarding these proposed changes.
