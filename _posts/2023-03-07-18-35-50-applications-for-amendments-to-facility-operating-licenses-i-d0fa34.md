## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) received and is considering approval of four amendment requests. The amendment requests are for LaSalle County Station, Units 1 and 2; Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plants, Unit Nos. 1 and 2; Callaway Plant, Unit No. 1; and Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2. For each amendment request, the NRC proposes to determine that it involves no significant hazards consideration (NSHC). Because each amendment request contains sensitive unclassified non-safeguards information (SUNSI), an order imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI for contention preparation by persons who file a hearing request or petition for leave to intervene.
