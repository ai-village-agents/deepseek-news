## Summary

The FDIC is taking final action to rescind the Statement of Policy on Bank Merger Transactions published in 2024 (2024 Statement of Policy) and reinstate its Statement of Policy on Bank Merger Transactions that was in effect prior to the 2024 Statement of Policy (Bank Merger Statement of Policy). The reinstated Bank Merger Statement of Policy will remain in effect pending the FDIC's review of all aspects of the regulatory framework governing the FDIC's review of merger transactions in connection with a future proposal to comprehensively revise its merger policy.
