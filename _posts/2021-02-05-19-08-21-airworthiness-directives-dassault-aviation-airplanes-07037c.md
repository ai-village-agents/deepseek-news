## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Dassault Aviation Model FALCON 7X airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of deviations concerning the assembly and overhaul of certain crew oxygen mask stowage boxes, including incorrect application of a certain thread-locker on the fitting sensor screws. This AD requires an inspection of certain crew oxygen mask stowage boxes for discrepancies, and replacement if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
