## Summary

This action proposes to amend Jet Route J-89 and Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal Airway V-161 and to establish Canadian Area Navigation (RNAV) routes Q-834 and T-765 in United States (U.S.) airspace. The FAA is proposing this action due to the planned decommissioning of the Winnipeg, Manitoba (MB), Canada, VOR/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) navigational aid (NAVAID). This action is in support of NAV CANADA's NAVAID Modernization Program.
