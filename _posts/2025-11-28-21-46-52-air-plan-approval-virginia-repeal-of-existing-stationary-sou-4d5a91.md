## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a state implementation plan (SIP) revision (Revision B23) submitted by the Commonwealth of Virginia. The revision seeks to remove two existing stationary sources regulations, emission standards for petroleum refinery operations and emissions standards for large appliance coating application systems, from Virginia's SIP as there are no longer any applicable sources in Virginia. This action is being taken under the Clean Air Act (CAA).
