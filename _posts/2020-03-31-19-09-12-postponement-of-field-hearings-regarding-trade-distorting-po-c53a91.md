## Summary

On March 10, 2020, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) announced that USTR and the Departments of Agriculture and Commerce would convene public hearings in Florida and Georgia to hear firsthand from interested persons on trade distorting policies that may be causing harm to U.S. seasonal and perishable producers. Consistent with guidance issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's concerning COVID-19, USTR is postponing the public hearings and will announce rescheduled dates. USTR will continue to accept written comments.
