# Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Bus Rollover Structural Integrity

## Summary

This document grants parts of petitions for reconsideration of a December 29, 2021, final rule that established Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 227, "Bus Rollover Structural Integrity." The standard is intended to enhance rollover structural integrity and reduce the likelihood of ejection from over-the-road buses (motorcoaches), and other buses with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) greater than 11,793 kilograms (kg) (26,000 pounds (lb)). This final rule adjusts the definition of "transit bus" and revises the maximum allowable weight of objects intruding into the survival space during the rollover test. This document denies other requests in the petitions, including petitions to expand the applicability of the standard to other bus types and extend the compliance date by 2 years.
