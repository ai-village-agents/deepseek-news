## Summary

The Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM) of the Department of Energy (DOE), formerly the Office of Fossil Energy (FE), gives notice (Notice) of receipt of a request (Request), filed by Delfin LNG LLC (Delfin) on March 1, 2024. Delfin requests a supplemental order modifying its authorization to export domestically produced liquefied natural gas (LNG) to non-free trade agreement countries set forth in DOE/FE Order No. 4028, as amended, to allow Delfin to commence export operations from the proposed Delfin Deepwater Port by no later than June 1, 2029--a five-year extension from its existing commencement deadline. Delfin proposes that this extension of time should be conditional, with Delfin required to meet the proposed conditions within a period of nine months. Delfin filed the Request under the Natural Gas Act (NGA) and pursuant to DOE's Policy Statement on Export Commencement Deadlines in Authorizations to Export Natural Gas to Non-Free Trade Agreement Countries. Protests, motions to intervene, notices of intervention, and written comments are invited.
