## Summary

The final rule amends regulations of the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to set forth the reporting requirements for the 2022 BE-12, Benchmark Survey of Foreign Direct Investment in the United States. The BE-12 survey is conducted every five years; the prior survey covered 2017. The benchmark survey covers the universe of foreign direct investment in the United States and is BEA's most detailed survey of such investment.
