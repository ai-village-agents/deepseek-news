## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is proposing to disapprove the State Implementation Plan (SIP) submittal from Alabama dated June 21, 2022, regarding the interstate transport requirements for the 2015 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or standard). The "Good Neighbor" or "Interstate Transport" provision of the Act requires that each State's implementation plan contain adequate provisions to prohibit emissions from within the State from significantly contributing to nonattainment or interfering with maintenance of the NAAQS in other states. This requirement is part of the broader set of "infrastructure" requirements, which are designed to ensure that the structural components of each State's air quality management program are adequate to meet the State's responsibilities under the CAA. If EPA finalizes this disapproval, the Agency will continue to be subject to an obligation to promulgate a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for Alabama to address the relevant interstate transport requirements, which was triggered by a finding of failure to submit published on June 22, 2022. Disapproval does not start a mandatory sanctions clock.
