## Summary

The OCC, as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, invites comment on the renewal of an information collection as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA). An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The OCC is soliciting comment concerning renewal of an information collection titled "Securities Offering Disclosure Rules." The OCC also is giving notice that it has sent the collection to OMB for review.
