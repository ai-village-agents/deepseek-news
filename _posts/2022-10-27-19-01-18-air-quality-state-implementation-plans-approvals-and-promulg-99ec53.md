## Summary

On September 28, 2022, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a final rule in the Federal Register approving revisions to the San Diego County Air Pollution Control District (SDAPCD) portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). In that rulemaking, the EPA inadvertently included erroneous amendatory instructions codifying the replacement of the previously approved versions of Rules 20.1, 20.3, and 20.4. This document corrects the errors in the final rule's amendatory instructions.
