## Summary

The Department of the Navy is establishing a new System of Records entitled the Command Individual Risk and Resiliency System (CIRRAS) application. The CIRRAS application will be used by the USMC to enable Commanding Officers and Senior Enlisted Advisors to make informed and timely decisions on Force Preservation Risk Assessments, to optimize individual/unit readiness, and to facilitate enterprise- wide risk management. Individual data will assist commanders by quickly identifying those Marines or Service Members requiring immediate command attention. Trend analysis will assist USMC commanders to implement mitigation strategies to improve overall individual/unit readiness. These records will also be used as a management tool for statistical analysis, tracking, reporting, evaluating program effectiveness, and conducting research.
