## Summary

This final rule provides additional crediting options for certain pilot in command (PIC) time to count towards the 1,000 hours of air carrier experience required to serve as a PIC in air carrier operations. In addition, this final rule allows credit for select military time in a powered-lift flown in horizontal flight towards the 250 hours of airplane time as PIC, or second in command (SIC) performing the duties of PIC, required for an airline transport pilot (ATP) certificate. This action is necessary to expand opportunities for pilots that meet the amended criteria to use relevant flight experience toward the requirements for an ATP certificate and to meet PIC qualification requirements for air carrier operations.
