## Summary

The FHWA, on behalf of UDOT, is issuing this notice to announce actions taken by UDOT that are final Federal agency actions. The final agency actions relate to design modifications to a planned and approved highway project, the West Davis Corridor project in Davis County, Utah, and more specifically to UDOT's re-evaluation of the Environmental Impact Statement and Section 4(f) Evaluation for the project in light of design modifications to the system interchange by which the West Davis Corridor project (State Route 67) will connect with Interstate 15 (I-15) and Legacy Parkway. Those actions grant licenses, permits and/or approvals for the project.
