## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of oxirane, 2-(phenoxymethyl)-, polymer with oxirane, ether with 2,2',2"-nitrilotris[ethanol] (3:1), diblock (CAS Reg. No. 2307555-89-9), when used as an inert ingredient in a pesticide chemical formulation. Spring Regulatory Sciences, on behalf of Stepan Company, submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of oxirane, 2- (phenoxymethyl)-, polymer with oxirane, ether with 2,2',2"- nitrilotris[ethanol] (3:1), diblock on food or feed commodities.
