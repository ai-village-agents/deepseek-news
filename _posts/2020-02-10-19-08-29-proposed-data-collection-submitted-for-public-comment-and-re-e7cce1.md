## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled the Environmental Public Health Tracking Network, an information system which collects data from other CDC programs such as the National Center for Health Statistics, other federal agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency, publicly accessible systems such as the Census Bureau, and funded and unfunded state and local health departments (SLHD).
