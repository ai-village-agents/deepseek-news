## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-11-08, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A330-841 and -941 airplanes. AD 2023-11-08 requires maintenance actions, including a high-pressure valve (HPV) seal integrity test, repetitive replacement of the HPV clips, revision of the existing airplane flight manual (AFM), and implementation of updates to the FAA-approved operator's minimum equipment list (MEL). Since the FAA issued AD 2023-11-08, the agency determined that the replacement intervals required by AD 2023- 11-08 must be reduced in order to address the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2023-11-08 and would reduce the HPV clip replacement intervals, and would require, for certain airplanes, an additional revision of the existing AFM. This proposed AD would also limit the installation of HPV clips, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA AD), which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
