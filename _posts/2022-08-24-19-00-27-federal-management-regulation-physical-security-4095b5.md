## Summary

GSA is issuing a final rule amending the Federal Management Regulation (FMR) to clarify the responsibilities of agencies for maintaining physical security standards in and at federally owned and leased facilities and grounds under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of GSA, including those facilities and grounds that have been delegated by the Administrator of General Services, in light of current law, Executive orders, and facility security standards. The revision will also update nomenclature and reorganize the subparts for better readability and clarity.
