## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to change how the CSX Transportation railroad drawbridge across the Pascagoula River, mile 1.5, Pascagoula, MS will be operated. The bridge will continue to open according to the drawbridge regulations but the bridge tender will operate this bridge from a remote location at the CSX railroad terminal in Mobile, Alabama. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
