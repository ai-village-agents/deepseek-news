## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-19- 26, which applied to all Dassault Aviation Model MYSTERE-FALCON 200 airplanes. AD 2018-19-26 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive maintenance requirements and airworthiness limitations. This AD continues to require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. This AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
