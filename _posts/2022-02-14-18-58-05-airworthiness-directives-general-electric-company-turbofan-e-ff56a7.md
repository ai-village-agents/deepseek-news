## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain General Electric Company (GE) GEnx-1B and GEnx-2B model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by the manufacturer's report of two findings of sheared compressor discharge pressure (CDP) bolts during engine shop visits. This AD requires initial and repetitive inspections of the CDP bolted joint and, depending on the findings, a piece part inspection of the stages 6-10 compressor rotor spool, CDP seal, and high-pressure turbine (HPT) rotor stage 1 disk. As a terminating action, this AD requires operators to reassemble the CDP bolted joint using a specific torque wrench. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
