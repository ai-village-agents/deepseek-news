## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by two reports of abnormal operation of the components of the ENG START panel or ECP due to liquid spillage in the system, and the subsequent uncommanded engine inflight shutdown (IFSD) of one engine in each case. This AD requires revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to define a liquid-prohibited zone in the flight deck and provide procedures following liquid spillage on the center pedestal, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
