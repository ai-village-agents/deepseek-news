## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled 2025 and 2027 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS). CDC is requesting a three-year approval to reinstate, with changes, the data collection for the national YRBS, a biennially school-based survey of high school students in the United States. This project includes a validation study that will inform the development of questions for the 2027 YRBS questionnaire.
