## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in response to a request under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended, from the City and Borough of Sitka, Alaska, propose to authorize nonlethal, incidental take by harassment of small numbers of Southeast Alaska stock of northern sea otters (Enhydra lutris kenyoni) between July 1, 2024, and July 1, 2025. The applicant requested this authorization for take by harassment that may result from activities associated with construction of a seaplane base in Sitka Channel, Sitka, Alaska. We estimate that this project may result in the nonlethal, incidental take by harassment of up to 36 sea otters from the Southeast Alaska stock. This proposed authorization, if finalized, will be for up to 36 takes of sea otters by Level B harassment only. No take by injury or mortality is requested, expected, or proposed to be authorized.
