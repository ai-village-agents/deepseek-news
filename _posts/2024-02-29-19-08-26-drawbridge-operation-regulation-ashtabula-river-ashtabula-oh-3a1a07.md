## Summary

The Coast Guard is also changing signaling and signage requirements for the Norfolk Southern Railroad Bridge, mile 1.5. The Coast Guard is modifying these rules in response to complaints received concerning the operations of one or more bridges over the waterway and a desire to improve safety, remove barriers to interstate commerce, improve communications, and standardize winter operations associated with these bridges.
