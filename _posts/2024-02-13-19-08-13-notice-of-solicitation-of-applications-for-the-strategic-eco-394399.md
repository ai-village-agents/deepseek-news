## Summary

The Under Secretary for Rural Development (RD or Agency) is seeking applications for the Strategic Economic and Community Development (SECD) priority, as reauthorized by section 6401 of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (2018 Farm Bill) for projects that support multi-jurisdictional and multi-sectoral strategic community investment plans. In fiscal year (FY) 2024, the covered RD programs will implement SECD by reserving loan and/or grant funds from the appropriations of the programs covered by this funding priority. This notice describes the requirements by which the RD programs will consider projects eligible for the covered programs' reserved appropriated funds and the information needed to submit an application. This NOSA is being issued prior to passage of a final appropriations act for FY 2024 to allow potential applicants time to submit applications for financial assistance under the covered programs and to give the RD programs time to process applications. Information on estimated FY 24 funding amounts can be found under SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION, section B. Federal Award Information of this notice.
