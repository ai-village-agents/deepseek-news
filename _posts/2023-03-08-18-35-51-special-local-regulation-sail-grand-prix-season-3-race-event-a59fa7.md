## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary special local regulation in the navigable waters of San Francisco Bay in San Francisco, CA in support of the San Francisco Sail Grand Prix, Season 3 race periods on May 4, 2023, through May 7, 2023. This special local regulation is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters and to ensure the safety of mariners transiting the area from the dangers associated with high-speed sailing activities associated with the Sail Grand Prix race event. This proposed rulemaking would temporarily prohibit persons and vessels from entering, transiting through, anchoring, blocking, or loitering within the event area adjacent to the city of San Francisco waterfront near the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz Island, unless authorized by the Captain of the Port San Francisco or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
