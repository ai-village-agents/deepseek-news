## Summary

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is seeking comments on a proposal under its Buy America waiver authorities to: modify its existing general applicability waiver for manufactured products to remove electric vehicle (EV) chargers; and waive certain Buy America requirements under FHWA regulations and the Build America, Buy America Act for the steel, iron, manufactured products, and construction materials in EV chargers in a manner that, over a deliberate transitional period, reduces the scope of that waiver. The proposed new waiver would initially waive all Buy America requirements for EV chargers and all components of EV chargers that are installed in a project and then phase-out the waiver with two changes during calendar year 2023 and one change in January 2024.
