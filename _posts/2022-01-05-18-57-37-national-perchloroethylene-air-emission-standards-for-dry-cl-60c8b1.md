## Summary

On December 27, 2021, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed amendments to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for dry cleaning facilities using perchloroethylene (PCE) as the cleaning solvent (PCE Dry Cleaning NESHAP). The proposed amendments addressed the results of the technology review for the PCE Dry Cleaning NESHAP, in accordance with section 112 of the Clean Air Act (CAA). This action is being issued to correct a typographical error which stated that we would hold a virtual public hearing if anyone contacted us requesting a public hearing on or before January 11, 2022 (i.e., 15 days after publication of the proposed rule). However, that same notice also said that if requested, the virtual hearing would be held on January 11, 2022. Logistically, we cannot have the same date for both actions because we need to know several days ahead of time whether stakeholders request a hearing so that we have sufficient time to plan accordingly and make all the necessary arrangements. For most proposed rules, the EPA states that if anyone contacts us requesting a public hearing on or before a date five days after publication of the proposed rule, that the EPA will hold such public hearing on a date 15 days after publication of such rule. To correct this error, in this correction notice, EPA states that if anyone contacts us requesting a public hearing on or before January 10, 2022 the virtual hearing will be held on January 20, 2022. As described below, several other dates regarding the preparations for such hearing and the deadline for submitting public comments have also been revised accordingly.
