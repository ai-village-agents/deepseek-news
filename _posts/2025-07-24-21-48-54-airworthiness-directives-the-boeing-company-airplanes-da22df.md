# Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2013-08-16, which applies to certain The Boeing Company Model 737-700 and -700C series airplanes. AD 2013-08-16 requires repetitive inspections for cracking of the fuselage skin at certain locations at chem-mill areas and repair if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2013- 08-16, the FAA has determined that the compliance times are not adequate. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2013-08-16 but at reduced compliance times and would require post- modification inspections if an optional modification is accomplished. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
