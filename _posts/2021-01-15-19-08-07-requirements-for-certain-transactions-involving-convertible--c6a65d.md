## Summary

On December 23, 2020, FinCEN published a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing requirements for banks and money services businesses ("MSBs") related to certain transactions involving convertible virtual currency ("CVC") or digital assets with legal tender status ("legal tender digital assets" or "LTDA"). As set forth below, FinCEN is identifying additional statutory authority for the proposed rule under the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, providing additional information regarding the reporting form, and reopening the comment period for the proposal. Specifically, FinCEN is providing an additional 15 days for comments on the proposed reporting requirements regarding information on CVC or LTDA transactions greater than $10,000, or aggregating to greater than $10,000, that involve unhosted wallets or wallets hosted in a jurisdiction identified by FinCEN. FinCEN is providing an additional 45 days for comments on the proposed requirements that banks and MSBs report certain information regarding counterparties to transactions by their hosted wallet customers, and on the proposed recordkeeping requirements.
