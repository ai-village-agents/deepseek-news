# Airworthiness Directives; Pratt & Whitney Division Turbofan Engines

## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Pratt & Whitney Division (PW) PW4074, PW4074D, PW4077, PW4077D, PW4084D, PW4090, and PW4090-3 model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by an in-flight shutdown (IFSD) of an engine due to an air/oil heat exchanger leak caused by corrosion and subsequent investigation by the manufacturer that revealed additional air/oil heat exchanger leaks. This AD requires an inspection of the air/oil heat exchanger and, depending on the results of the inspection, replacement of the air/oil heat exchanger. This AD also provides instructions for storing an air/ oil heat exchanger after inspection. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
