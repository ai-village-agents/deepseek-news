## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-02-20, which applies to certain H[eacute]licopt[egrave]res Guimbal Model Cabri G2 helicopters. AD 2021-02-20 requires initial and repetitive inspections of certain rotating and non-rotating scissor fittings, and depending on the results, replacing the affected assembly. AD 2021-02-20 also prohibits installing certain main rotor hubs (MRHs) and swashplate guides unless the initial inspection has been accomplished. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-02-20, the MRH and swashplate guide have been redesigned to include a certain part- numbered scissor fitting. This proposed AD would retain certain requirements of AD 2021-02-20, require installation of newly designed parts, provide a terminating action for the initial and repetitive inspections, and revise the applicability. This proposed AD would also extend the repetitive inspection interval and prohibit installing certain MRHs and swashplate guides. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
