## Summary

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) seeks input on a proposal to revise the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (NIH Guidelines) to include specific considerations and requirements for conducting research involving gene drive modified organisms (GDMO) in contained research settings. NIH is proposing to update the NIH Guidelines to clarify minimum containment requirements, propose considerations for performing risk assessments, and define additional institutional responsibilities regarding Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBCs) and Biosafety Officers (BSOs). The proposed revisions are specific to GDMO research subject to the NIH Guidelines, conducted in contained settings and are consistent with the recommendations of the NIH Novel and Exceptional Technology Research Advisory Committee report, Gene Drives in Biomedical Research (NExTRAC Report). NIH does not currently support research involving potential field release of GDMOs and the NIH Guidelines pertain to contained research; accordingly, no changes regarding potential field release are being proposed in this Notice. NIH is also proposing revisions to the NIH Guidelines to harmonize with the Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL), 6th edition regarding the Risk Group (RG) categorization of West Nile Virus (WNV) and Saint Louis Encephalitis Virus (SLEV).
