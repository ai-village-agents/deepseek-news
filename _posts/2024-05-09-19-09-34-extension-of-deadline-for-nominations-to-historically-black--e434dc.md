## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is extending the deadline for nominations for the Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Serving Institutions Advisory Council pursuant to the authority of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), as amended. The Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Serving Institutions Advisory Council (HBCU-MSI AC) is a Federal advisory committee chartered under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The HBCU-MSI AC was created in 2023 by the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Public Engagement and Environmental Education at the direction of the Administrator of EPA. Implementing authority was delegated to the Administrator of EPA. The HBCU-MSI AC provides independent advice and recommendations to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on how to leverage Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Serving Institutions to help diversify the agency's workforce and nurture the next generation of environmental leaders and ensure that these vital institutions of higher learning have the resources and support to continue to thrive for generations to come. MSIs are institutions of higher education that serve minority populations and include HBCUs, Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and Asian American and Pacific Islander Serving Institutions (AAPISIs).
