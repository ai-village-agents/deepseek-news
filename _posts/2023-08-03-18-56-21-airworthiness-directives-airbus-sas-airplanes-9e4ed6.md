## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-17- 09, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. AD 2022-17-09 continued to require the actions of AD 2021- 16-03 and required a modification to restore two independent layers of lightning strike protection. This AD was prompted by reports of the incorrect application of lightning strike edge glow sealant protection at specific locations on the wing tanks, and a determination that additional airplanes need to perform a modification to restore two independent layers of lightning strike protection on the wing lower or upper cover. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2022-17-09, and also requires restoring the two independent layers of lightning strike protection; as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
