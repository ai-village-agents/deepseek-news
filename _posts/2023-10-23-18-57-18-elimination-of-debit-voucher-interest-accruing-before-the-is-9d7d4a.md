# Elimination of Debit Voucher Interest Accruing Before the Issuance of a Bill

## Summary

This document amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regulations to reflect the elimination of CBP's collection of interest specific to debit vouchers in order to enable CBP to efficiently include debit voucher bills in CBP's automated billing process in the Automated Commercial Environment. As a result of this change, CBP will automatically issue debit voucher bills, inclusive of all applicable interest accruing on such bills and dishonored payment fees. Interest on the debited amount will accrue from the date of the issuance of a debit voucher bill, and no longer from the date of the debit voucher.
