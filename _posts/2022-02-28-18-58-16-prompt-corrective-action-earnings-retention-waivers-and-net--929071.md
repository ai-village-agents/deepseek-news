## Summary

The NCUA Board (Board) is extending two temporary changes to its prompt corrective action (PCA) regulations to help ensure that federally insured credit unions (FICUs) remain operational and liquid during the COVID-19 crisis. The first amends these regulations to temporarily extend the Board's ability to issue an order applicable to all FICUs to waive the earnings retention requirement for any FICU that is classified as adequately capitalized. The second extends a provision that modifies the specific documentation required for net worth restoration plans (NWRPs) for FICUs that become undercapitalized. These temporary modifications will remain in place until March 31, 2023. This rule is substantially similar to an interim final rule that the Board published on April 19, 2021 ("2021 PCA interim final").
