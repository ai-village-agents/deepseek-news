## Summary

This action proposes to amend Jet Routes J-70 and J-94; amend Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal Airways V-30, V-55, V-84, V-170, and V-274; and revoke Jet Routes J-547 and J-548 in the vicinity of Pullman, MI. The FAA is proposing this action due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Pullman, MI, VOR/ Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) navigational aid (NAVAID). This NAVAID is being decommissioned as part of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
