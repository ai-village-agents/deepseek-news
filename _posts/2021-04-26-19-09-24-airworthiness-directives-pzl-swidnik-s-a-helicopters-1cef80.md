## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for PZL Swidnik S.A. (PZL) Model W-3A helicopters. This AD requires repetitive inspections of a certain part-numbered stainless steel cable (cable) installed on a certain part-numbered hoist assembly, and depending on those inspection results, removing certain parts from service and reporting the results. This AD also prohibits installing the affected part unless it is inspected per the AD requirements. This AD was prompted by wear of and damage to the cable near the swaged terminal due to movement of the hook assembly. The actions of this AD are intended to address an unsafe condition on these products.
