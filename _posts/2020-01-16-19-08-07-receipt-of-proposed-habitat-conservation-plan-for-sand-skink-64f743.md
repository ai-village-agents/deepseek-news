## Summary

We, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce receipt of an application to amend an incidental take permit (ITP) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. K. Hovnanian at Mystic Dunes, LLC (applicant) is requesting to modify its 5-year ITP authorizing take of federally listed sand skink and blue-tailed mole skink incidental to construction in Osceola County, Florida. We request public comment on the application, which includes the applicant's proposed habitat conservation plan (HCP), and the Service's preliminary determination that this HCP qualifies as "low-effect," categorically excluded, under the National Environmental Policy Act. To make this determination, we used our environmental action statement and low- effect screening form, both of which are also available for public review.
