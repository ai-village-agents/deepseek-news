## Summary

This action proposes a Special Federal Aviation Regulation for alternate eligibility requirements to safely certificate initial groups of powered-lift pilots, as well as determine which operating rules apply to powered-lift on a temporary basis to enable the FAA to gather additional information and determine the most appropriate permanent rulemaking path for these aircraft. Powered-lift will be type certificated as special class aircraft under the existing regulations. Currently, there is not an established path for civilian pilots to be certificated with a powered-lift category rating. The general and commercial operating regulations do not contemplate operation of powered-lift. In addition to proposed changes for powered-lift, this action also proposes changes that would affect practical tests in aircraft that require type ratings, including airplanes and helicopters, training center rotorcraft instructor eligibility, training, and testing requirements, and training center use of rotorcraft in flight instruction.
