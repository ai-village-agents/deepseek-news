## Summary

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) seeks public comment on a proposed rule revising the Agency for International Development Acquisition Regulation (AIDAR) to incorporate new requirements for Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) and update existing child safeguarding requirements. This proposed rule strengthens protections for USAID's program participants, community members, project staff, and other individuals in a position of vulnerability, and aligns and consolidates new PSEA and updated child safeguarding compliance and reporting requirements with existing requirements for Counter Trafficking in Persons.
