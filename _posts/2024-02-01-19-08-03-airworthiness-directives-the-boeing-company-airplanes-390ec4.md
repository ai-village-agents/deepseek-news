## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-26- 08, which applied to The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines. AD 2020-26-08 required repetitive inspections of the inner fixed structure (IFS) forward upper fire seal and thermal insulation blankets in the forward upper area of the thrust reverser (TR) for damage and applicable on- condition actions. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-26-08, the FAA determined that a new upper splitter fairing assembly is needed to prevent damage to the fire seal and thermal insulation blanket. This AD continues to require the actions specified in AD 2020-26-08 and requires determining if an affected part number of the upper splitter fairing assembly is installed on the engine, replacing an affected upper splitter fairing assembly part number with a new upper splitter fairing assembly part number, inspecting the IFS forward upper fire seal and thermal insulation blanket for any damage, and applicable on- condition actions. This AD also prohibits the installation of affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
