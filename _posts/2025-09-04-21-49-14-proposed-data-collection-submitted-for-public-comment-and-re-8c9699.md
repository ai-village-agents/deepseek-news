## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Distribution of Traceable Opioid Material[supreg] Kits (TOM[supreg] Kits) across U.S. and International Laboratories. The purpose of this information collection request (ICR) is for the CDC to assure that the Traceable Opioid Material[supreg] Kits (TOM[supreg] Kits) are equitably distributed to domestic and international partner laboratories, and to allow CDC to understand the types of laboratories requesting these materials and the analyses that are being conducted.
