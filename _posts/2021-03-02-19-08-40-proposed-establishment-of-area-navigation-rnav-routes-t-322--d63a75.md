## Summary

This action proposes to establish area navigation (RNAV) routes T-322, T-392, T-403, and T-405 in the central United States. The proposed new RNAV routes would expand the availability of RNAV routing in support of transitioning the National Airspace System (NAS) from ground-based to satellite-based navigation. Additionally, a portion of the new RNAV routes would provide enroute structure where VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airway segments were removed due to the Sioux City, IA; Park Rapids, MN; and Huron, SD, VORs decommissioning in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
