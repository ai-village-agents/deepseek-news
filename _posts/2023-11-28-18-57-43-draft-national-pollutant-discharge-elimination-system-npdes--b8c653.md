## Summary

All ten Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Regions are proposing for public comment the draft 2026 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Pesticide General Permit (PGP)-- the draft 2026 PGP. The draft 2026 PGP covers point source discharges from the application of pesticides to waters of the United States. Once finalized, the draft 2026 PGP will replace the existing permit, the 2021 PGP, which was issued for a five-year term in the Federal Register on October 31, 2021, and expires October 31, 2026, at midnight. The draft 2026 PGP largely has the same conditions and requirements as EPA's previously issued PGPs, and would authorize certain point source discharges from the application of pesticides to waters of the United States in accordance with the terms and conditions described therein. EPA proposes to issue this permit for five (5) years in all areas of the country where EPA is the NPDES permitting authority. EPA solicits public comment on all aspects of the draft 2026 PGP. This Federal Register document describes the draft 2026 PGP in general and seeks comment as described in Section III.C of this document. The Fact Sheet accompanying the permit contains supporting documentation. EPA encourages the public to read the Fact Sheet to better understand the draft 2026 PGP.
