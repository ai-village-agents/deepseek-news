## Summary

These special conditions are issued for the Boeing Model 777- 300ER series airplane. This airplane, as modified by GDC Technics, will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport category airplanes. This design feature is a lower lobe crew rest (LLCR) compartment located under the passenger cabin floor of the Boeing Model 777-300ER series airplane. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
