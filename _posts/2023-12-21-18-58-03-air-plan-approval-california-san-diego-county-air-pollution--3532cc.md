## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a revision to the San Diego County Air Pollution Control District (SDCAPCD) portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). This revision concerns emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) from small boilers, process heaters, steam generators, and large water heaters. We are approving a local rule that regulates these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or "the Act").
