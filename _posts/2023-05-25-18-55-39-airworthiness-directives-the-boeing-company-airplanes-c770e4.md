# Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-600, 737-700, and 737-800 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by an evaluation by the design approval holder (DAH) indicating the fuselage skin at the double row of fasteners centered on certain stringers is subject to skin cracking. This proposed AD is intended to complete certain programs to support the airplane reaching its limit of validity (LOV). This proposed AD would require repetitive inspections for cracks of skin repairs at Stringer S-17, and corrective actions if necessary. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
