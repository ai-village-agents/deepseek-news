# Airworthiness Directives; De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited (Type Certificate Previously Held by Bombardier, Inc.) Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA is revising a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-04-20, which applies to certain De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited Model DHC-8-400 series airplanes. This action revises the NPRM by including an additional retained requirement and revising the terminating action to apply to additional airplanes. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over those in the NPRM, the FAA is reopening the comment period to allow the public the chance to comment on these changes.
