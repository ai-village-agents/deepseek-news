## Summary

The Bureau of Industry and Security is amending the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by adding 28 entities under 32 entries to the Entity List. These entities are listed under the destinations of Armenia (1), the People's Republic of China (China) (12), Malta (1), Russia (10), Singapore (1), Spain (1), Syria (1), Turkey (1), the United Arab Emirates (UAE) (2), and Uzbekistan (2). Some entities are added under multiple entries, accounting for the difference in the totals. This final rule also modifies two existing entries on the Entity List under the destinations of China and Russia.
