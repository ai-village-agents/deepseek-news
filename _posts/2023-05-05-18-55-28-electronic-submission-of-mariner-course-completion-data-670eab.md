# Electronic Submission of Mariner Course Completion Data

## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to require Coast Guard-approved training providers to electronically submit student course completion data to the Coast Guard within 5 business days of completing a Coast Guard-approved course. The National Maritime Center would use this information to validate mariner course completion as part of an application for a Merchant Mariner Credential. In addition, the Coast Guard proposes to replace gendered titles for certain officer and rating endorsements in keeping with Coast Guard policy of using gender- neutral language. We expect these proposed changes to lessen the probability of credentials being issued to mariners who have not met the professional requirements for their endorsements and to appropriately conform terms that should be gender-neutral.
