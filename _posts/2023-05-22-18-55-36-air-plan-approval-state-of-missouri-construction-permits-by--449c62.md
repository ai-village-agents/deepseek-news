## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the Missouri State Implementation Plan (SIP) received on August 4, 2022. The submission removes a provision in the Missouri regulation "Construction Permits By Rule" that allows the burning of illegal and waste pharmaceutical drugs in crematories and animal incinerators. In the previous revision, submitted to EPA on March 7, 2019, EPA approved selected revisions of the rule but did not act on a portion of the revision that included the disposal of pharmaceuticals in crematories and animal incinerators because it conflicted with federal requirements on the incineration of illegal and waste pharmaceuticals. By removing the conflicting language, approval of these revisions will ensure consistency between State and federally approved rules. These revisions along with other minor text changes are administrative in nature and do not impact the stringency of the SIP or air quality. The EPA's proposed approval of this rule revision is in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
