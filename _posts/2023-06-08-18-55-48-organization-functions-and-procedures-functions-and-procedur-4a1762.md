## Summary

The Forest Service (Agency), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register on April 21, 2023 initiating a 60-day comment period. The advance notice invited public comment on the following topic and additional questions: Given that climate change and related stressors are resulting in increasing impacts with rapid and variable rates of change on national forests and grasslands, how should the Forest Service adapt current policies to protect, conserve, and manage the national forests and grasslands for climate resilience, so that the Agency can provide for ecological integrity and support social and economic sustainability over time? In response to feedback from prospective commenters stating that they would benefit from additional time to adequately consider and respond to the advance notice, USDA's Forest Service has determined that an extension of the comment period by an additional 30 days, from June 20, 2023 to July 20, 2023, is appropriate.
