## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE or the Department) is issuing a request for information ("RFI") to solicit public input regarding certain aspects of its energy conservation standards for manufactured housing. The public input received is anticipated to help guide DOE's further refinement of certain aspects of its standards for manufactured housing, as well as the supporting technical analysis, including anticipated costs and benefits. It may also serve as the basis for restructuring the approach and framework for standards that would apply to manufactured housing. DOE also seeks any additional information from the industry and public which may further inform the agency's views and regulatory program.
