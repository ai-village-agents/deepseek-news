## Summary

This action increases the possession and trip limits of Georges Bank cod, Gulf of Maine cod, Gulf of Maine haddock, Southern New England/Mid-Atlantic winter flounder, American plaice, and witch flounder for Northeast multispecies common pool vessels for the remainder of the 2020 fishing year. This action will provide the common pool fishery greater opportunity to harvest, but not exceed, the annual quotas for these stocks.
