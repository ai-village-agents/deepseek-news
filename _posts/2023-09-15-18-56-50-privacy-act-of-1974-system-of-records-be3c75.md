## Summary

Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, notice is hereby given that the VA is modifying the system of records entitled, "Corporate Travel and Charge Cards--VA" (131VA047). This system is used for operating, auditing and managing the charge card program involving commercial purchases authorized by VA employees. It is an end-to-end travel management service that includes all aspects of official Federal business travel including travel planning, authorization, reservations, ticketing, fulfillment, expense reimbursement and travel management reporting. These records will include permanent change of station moves that have been approved for relocation entitlements. The system serves as a repository that captures all required documentation that would assist with providing instructions to obtain a government passport, visa and country clearance, as applicable, as well as timely approval routing, as outlined in VA travel policy for VA employees traveling in an official capacity to a foreign country.
