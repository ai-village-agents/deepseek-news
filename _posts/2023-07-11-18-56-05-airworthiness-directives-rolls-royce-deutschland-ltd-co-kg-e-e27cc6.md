## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Model Trent 1000 engines. This AD was prompted by reports of excessive wear on the inner seal fins of certain high-pressure turbine (HPT) triple seals. This AD requires an inspection of the HPT triple seal for excessive wear and, depending on the results of the inspection, replacement of the HPT triple seal and the intermediate-pressure turbine (IPT) disk, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
