## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -113, - 114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, - 211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of a nose landing gear (NLG) sliding tube rupture that led to a NLG collapse. This AD requires inspection of certain NLG and main landing gear (MLG) sliding tubes and applicable corrective actions and eventual replacement of all affected parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference (IBR). This AD also prohibits the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
