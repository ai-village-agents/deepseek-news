## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2013-20-13 for certain Bell Helicopter Textron Canada Limited (now Bell Textron Canada Limited) (Bell) Model 206B and 206L helicopters. AD 2013-20-13 requires installing a placard beneath the engine power dual tachometer and revising the Operating Limitations section of the existing Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) for your helicopter. Since the FAA issued AD 2013-20-13, the engine manufacturer expanded the RPM (N2) steady-state operation avoidance range limits. This proposed AD would retain certain requirements of AD 2013-20-13, require revising certain sections of the existing RFM for your helicopter, and require either replacing or installing a placard. The actions of this proposed AD are intended to address an unsafe condition on these products.
