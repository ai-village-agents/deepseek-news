## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to deny the application from Bianco Trucking Services, LLC d.b.a. CDL and Operator Training ("Bianco") for an exemption to allow students between the ages of 18 and 20 holding a "K" restricted commercial learners permit (CLP) issued by another State to attend its driver training facility in Michigan. FMCSA analyzed the application and public comments and determined that granting the exemption would not likely achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent such exemption.
