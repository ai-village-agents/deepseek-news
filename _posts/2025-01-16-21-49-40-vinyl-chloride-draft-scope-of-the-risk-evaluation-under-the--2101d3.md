## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is announcing the availability of and seeking public comment on the draft scope of the risk evaluation to be conducted under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for vinyl chloride (ethene, chloro-; CASRN 75-01-4). Under TSCA, the scope documents must include the conditions of use, hazards, exposures, and the potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations that EPA expects to consider in conducting the risk evaluation for this chemical substance. The purpose of risk evaluations under TSCA is to determine whether a chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment under the conditions of use, including unreasonable risk to potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations identified as relevant to the risk evaluation by EPA, and without consideration of costs or non-risk factors.
