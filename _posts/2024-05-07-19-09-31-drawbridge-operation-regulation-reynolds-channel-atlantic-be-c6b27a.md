## Summary

The Coast Guard is altering the operating schedule that governs the Atlantic Beach Bridge across the Reynolds Channel, mile 0.4, at Atlantic Beach, NY. The bridge owner, Nassau County Bridge Authority, submitted a request on September 22, 2022 to modify the regulation to decrease the amount of openings on signal from October through May. On November 16, 2023 Nassau County Bridge Authority sent an additional request to add a bridge tower call number and remove outdated language. It is expected that this change to the regulations will better serve the needs of the community while continuing to meet the reasonable needs of navigation.
