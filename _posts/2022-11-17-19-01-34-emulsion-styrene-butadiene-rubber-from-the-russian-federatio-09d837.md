## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) determines that imports of emulsion styrene-butadiene rubber (ESBR) from the Russian Federation (Russia) are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV) for the period of investigation (POI) October 1, 2020, through September 30, 2021. Commerce has also reconsidered Russia's market economy status and has determined to treat Russia as a non-market economy in forthcoming proceedings.
