## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of passenger door girt bar fitting assembly safety hooks being stuck in the upward position. This AD requires repetitive detailed inspections of girt bar fitting assemblies, repetitive greasing of girt bar fitting assembly bushes, and, depending on findings, accomplishment of applicable corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
