## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering issuance of an exemption in response to the May 4, 2023, request from Yankee Atomic Electric Company (YAEC), for the Yankee Nuclear Power Station (YNPS or Yankee Rowe) located in Rowe, Massachusetts. The proposed exemption from NRC regulations, if granted, would permit YAEC to make withdrawals from a segregated account within Yankee Rowe's overall nuclear decommissioning trust (NDT), on an annual basis, for spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and Greater than Class C (GTCC) waste management and non-radiological site restoration without prior notification to the NRC. The NRC staff is issuing an environmental assessment (EA) and finding of no significant impact (FONSI) associated with the proposed exemption.
