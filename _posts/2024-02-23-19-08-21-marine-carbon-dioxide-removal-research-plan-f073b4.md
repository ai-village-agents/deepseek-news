## Summary

The National Science Foundation (NSF), on behalf of the White House National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Marine Carbon Dioxide Removal Fast-Track Action Committee (MCDR-FTAC), requests input from all interested parties to inform the development of an implementation plan to advance a key recommendation of the Ocean Climate Action Plan (OCAP) regarding marine carbon dioxide removal (CDR) research. Marine CDR refers to efforts to increase the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide taken up by the ocean, adding to the large, natural ocean carbon reservoir. The deployment of safe and effective CDR approaches is increasingly regarded in scientific assessments as necessary in the near future to meet climate goals. The implementation plan, hereafter referred to as the Marine CDR Plan, will advance three actions to enable marine CDR research that are called for in the Ocean Climate Action Plan: establish a comprehensive Federal marine CDR research program; clarify permitting, regulatory, and other standards and policies, and establish guidelines for marine CDR research; and establish a Marine CDR Initiative to enable public-private partnerships and establish mechanisms to strengthen interagency coordination and promote public awareness and engagement. Through this Request for Information (RFI), the MCDR-FTAC seeks input on each element of the Marine CDR Plan.
