## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for a new information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on November 17, 2020. The collection involves an electronic distribution of a survey to gather information on current practices for pilots of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). The target information to be gathered is the common fatigue-related practices, and the minimum knowledge, skills, abilities (KSAs), testing, and staffing procedures required for operating UAS. The information to be collected will be used to inform future rulemaking and the development of supporting guidance. The information is necessary because the existing regulatory framework, to include the certification of airmen, was not designed with remote pilots in mind. To broadly integrate UAS and remote pilots into the National Airspace System, further rulemaking will be required to address remote pilot certification for air carrier operations and flight and duty time periods applicable to remote pilot air carrier operations.
