## Summary

The Department proposes a rule to provide that private attorneys, interpreters, and other third parties may attend certain appointments at passport agencies and centers and at U.S. embassies and consulates abroad to assist the person requesting services (the applicant/requester). This rulemaking permitting third-party attendance will apply only to appointments in support of an application for a U.S. passport, either domestically or overseas; to appointments related to a request for a Consular Report of Birth Abroad or a Certificate of Loss of Nationality of the United States (CLN); and to other appointments for certain other services offered by American Citizens Services (ACS) units at U.S. embassies and consulates overseas (posts). In addition, the Department is proposing technical corrections to clarify who may act as a consular officer for purposes of the Protection and Welfare of Citizens and their Property.
