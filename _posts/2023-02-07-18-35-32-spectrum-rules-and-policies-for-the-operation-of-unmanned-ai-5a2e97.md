## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC" or "Commission") seeks comment on rules to promote access by unmanned aircraft system (UAS) operators to licensed spectrum to support UAS operations. First, this document seeks comment on service rules for the 5030-5091 MHz band that will provide UAS operators with access to licensed spectrum with the reliability necessary to support safety-critical UAS command-and-control communications links. Second, due to the increasing interest in operating UAS using existing terrestrial flexible-use spectrum networks, this document seeks comment on whether the Commission's current rules are adequate to ensure co- existence of terrestrial mobile operations and UAS use or whether changes to these rules are necessary. Third, to further promote the safe integration of unmanned aircraft operations in controlled airspace and facilitate flight coordination, this document proposes a process for UAS operators to obtain a license in the aeronautical very high frequency (VHF) band to communicate with air traffic control and other aircraft. Together, these measures will help to promote the growth and safety of UAS operations.
