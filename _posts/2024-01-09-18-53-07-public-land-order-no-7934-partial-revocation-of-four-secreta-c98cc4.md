## Summary

This Order partially revokes four withdrawals created by Secretarial Orders dated July 2, 1902, August 26, 1902, February 28, 1908, and July 25, 1908, issued pursuant to the Reclamation Act of June 17, 1902, Section 3, to support the Bureau of Reclamation's (BOR's) Grand Valley Reclamation Project. The BOR has determined that 31.10 acres of the withdrawn land are no longer needed for reclamation purposes and has asked that the withdrawals be partially revoked as to these acres. This Order also opens these 31.10 acres to appropriation under the public land laws, subject to valid existing rights. The land has been and will remain open to mineral leasing and will remain closed to location and entry under the United States mining laws.
