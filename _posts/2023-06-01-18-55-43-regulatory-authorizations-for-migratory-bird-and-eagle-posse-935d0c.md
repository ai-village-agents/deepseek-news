# Regulatory Authorizations for Migratory Bird and Eagle Possession by the General Public, Educators, and Government Agencies

## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to amend our regulations to revise current regulatory authorizations and add new regulatory authorizations for possession of migratory birds and eagles and other purposes. These proposed changes would more efficiently and appropriately authorize the general public, educators, and government agency employees to possess birds and eagles in certain specific situations while meeting our obligations under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. We also propose a change to the Airborne Hunting Act regulations to clarify what Federal authorizations may be used to comply with that statute.
