## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping duty (AD) order on certain cut-to-length carbon-quality steel plate products (CTL plate) from the Republic of Korea (Korea). The period of review (POR) is February 1, 2022, through January 31, 2023. Commerce preliminarily finds that the producers/exporters subject to this administrative review did not make sales of subject merchandise at prices below normal value (NV) during the POR. We are rescinding this administrative review, in part, with respect to two companies. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.
