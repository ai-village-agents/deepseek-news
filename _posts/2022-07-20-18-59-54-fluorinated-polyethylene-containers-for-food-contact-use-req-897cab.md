## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is opening a docket to obtain data and information on the use of fluorinated polyethylene for food contact applications. Specifically, FDA is seeking scientific data and information on current food contact uses of fluorinated polyethylene, consumer dietary exposure that may result from those uses, and safety of certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances that may migrate from fluorinated polyethylene food containers. The purpose of this request is to ensure that we have current information to support our review of the use of fluorinated polyethylene containers used in food contact applications to help ensure that this use continues to be safe. FDA may use information submitted in response to this notice to update dietary exposure estimates and safety assessments for the authorized food contact use of fluorinated polyethylene.
