## Summary

Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on September 23, 2025, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of Bose Corporation of Framingham, Massachusetts. Supplements to the complaint were filed on November 20 and 24, 2025, and December 4 and 9, 2025. The complaint, as supplemented, alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain open-ear earpiece devices by reason of the infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 11,140,469 ("the '469 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 11,659,313 ("the '313 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 11,997,442 ("the '442 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 12,356,132 ("the '132 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 12,155,984 ("the '984 patent"); and U.S. Patent No. D1,051,103 ("the D103 patent"). The complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The complainant requests that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a general exclusion order, or in the alternative a limited exclusion order, and cease and desist orders.
