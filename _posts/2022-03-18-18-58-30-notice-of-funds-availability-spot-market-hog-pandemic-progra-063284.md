## Summary

The Farm Service Agency (FSA) published a notice on December 14, 2021, announcing the availability of $50 million for the Spot Market Hog Pandemic Program (SMHPP). This document clarifies hog eligibility, documentation requirements, and payment factoring. SMHPP assists producers who sold hogs through a spot market sale from April 16, 2020, through September 1, 2020, the period during which these producers faced the greatest reduction in market prices due to the COVID-19 pandemic. SMHPP excludes non-adult pigs or other swine that were not intended for slaughter. SMHPP also excludes hogs sold under contracts that had a premium or other formula outside a spot market sale. The eligibility requirements, payment calculation, and application procedure for SMHPP are included in this notice.
