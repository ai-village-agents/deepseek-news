## Summary

The Census Bureau will conduct a virtual tribal consultation on the Proof of Concept for the Detailed Demographic and Housing Characteristics File A (DHC-A) on February 23, 2023. Feedback on the Proof of Concept will help inform final decisions on the 2020 Census Detailed DHC-A. The tribal consultation reflects the Census Bureau's continuous commitment to strengthen nation-to-nation relationships with federally recognized tribes. The Census Bureau's procedures for outreach, notice, and consultation ensure involvement of tribes to the extent practicable and permitted by law before making decisions or implementing policies, rules, or programs that affect federally recognized tribal governments. These meetings are open to citizens of federally recognized tribes by invitation. The Census Bureau provided information on the feedback it is seeking in preparation for the tribal consultation focused on the Proof of Concept for the Detailed DHC-A. In that regard, the Census Bureau is asking tribal governments to review the Proof of Concept and accompanying materials. We would like to hear from tribal nations if they will be impacted positively, negatively, or not at all, if we release the Detailed DHC-A using the current specifications outlined in the Proof of Concept. Please provide the level of geography, description of the use case(s), and implications should the data be released as reflected in this Proof of Concept. The purpose of the tribal consultation is to hear tribes' recommendations.
