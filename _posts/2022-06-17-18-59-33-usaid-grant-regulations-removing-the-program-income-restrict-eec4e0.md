## Summary

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) proposes to amend the rules for administering Federal awards to remove a prohibition on for-profit entities from adding program income to a Federal award. This change allows any USAID assistance recipient-- whether nonprofit or for-profit--to use the "addition method" for managing program income under a Federal award. This will align USAID's approach to program income with other Federal agencies.
