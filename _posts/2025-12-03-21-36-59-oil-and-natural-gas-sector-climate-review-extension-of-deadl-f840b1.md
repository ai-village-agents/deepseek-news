## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to respond to comments on an interim final rule (IFR) related to the new source performance standards (NSPS) and emissions guidelines (EG) for crude oil and natural gas facilities established at 40 CFR part 60, subparts OOOOb and OOOOc. Specifically, the EPA is responding to comments on the IFR published in the Federal Register on July 31, 2025, that extended deadlines for certain provisions related to control devices, equipment leaks, storage vessels, process controllers, and covers/closed vent systems; extended the date for future implementation of the Super Emitter Program (SEP); and extended the State plan submittal deadline in OOOOc. After carefully considering comments received and testimony provided at a public hearing, the EPA concludes that the amendments made in the IFR are warranted and is making further changes to the compliance deadlines in the IFR related to net heating value (NHV) monitoring and the initial reporting deadline.
