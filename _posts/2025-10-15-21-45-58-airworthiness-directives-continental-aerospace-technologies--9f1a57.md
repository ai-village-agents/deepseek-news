## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Continental Aerospace Technologies GmbH (Continental) Model TAE 125-02- 125 engines. This AD was prompted by multiple reports of cracks in the cylinder heads, which can cause engine coolant to leak into the combustion chamber. This AD requires a one-time inspection of the engine coolant for contamination and, depending on the inspection results, replacement of the coolant and replacement of the cylinder heads. This AD also prohibits installing a cylinder head on any engine unless it is a serviceable part. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
