## Summary

NMFS issues this notice to inform the public that there will be an increase of the fee rate required to repay the reduction loan financing the Southeast Alaska Purse Seine Salmon Fishing Capacity reduction program. Effective June 1, 2022, NMFS is increasing the Loan B fee rate to 2.5 percent of landed value to ensure timely repayment of the loan. The fee rate for Loan A will remain unchanged at 1 percent of landed value. The increased fee rate is due to the decrease in projected value of the Southeast Alaska Purse Seine Salmon catch for 2022.
