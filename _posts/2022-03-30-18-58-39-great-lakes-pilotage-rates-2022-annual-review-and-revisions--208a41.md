## Summary

In accordance with the statutory provisions enacted by the Great Lakes Pilotage Act of 1960, the Coast Guard is issuing new base pilotage rates for the 2022 shipping season. This rule will adjust the pilotage rates to account for changes in district operating expenses, an increase in the number of pilots, and anticipated inflation. In addition, this rule will make a policy change to round up in the staffing model. The Coast Guard is also making methodology changes to factor in an apprentice pilot's compensation benchmark for the estimated number of apprentice pilots. The Coast Guard estimates that this rule will result in a 7-percent increase in pilotage operating costs compared to the 2021 season.
