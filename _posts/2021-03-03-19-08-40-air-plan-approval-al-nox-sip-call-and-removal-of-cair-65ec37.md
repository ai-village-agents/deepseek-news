## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Alabama through a letter dated February 27, 2020, to add regulations maintaining compliance with the State's Nitrogen Oxide (NO<INF>X</INF>) SIP Call obligations for large non-electricity generating units (non-EGUs), to repeal the State's previously sunsetted NO<INF>X</INF> Budget Trading Program regulations, and to repeal the State's Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) regulations. EPA is also proposing to conditionally approve into the SIP state regulations that establish monitoring and reporting requirements for units subject to the NO<INF>X</INF> SIP Call, including alternative monitoring options for certain sources for NO<INF>X</INF> SIP Call purposes. In addition, EPA is proposing to make ministerial changes to reflect the State's renumbering of an existing regulation for "New Combustion Sources."
