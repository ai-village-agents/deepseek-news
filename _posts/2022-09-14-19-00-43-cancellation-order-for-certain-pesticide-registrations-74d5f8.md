## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) hereby announces its order for the cancellations, voluntarily requested by the registrants and accepted by the Agency, of the products listed in Table 1 and Table 1A of Unit II, pursuant to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). This cancellation order follows an April 28, 2022, Federal Register Notice of Receipt of Requests from the registrants listed in Table 2 of Unit II, to voluntarily cancel these product registrations. In the April 28, 2022, notice, EPA indicated that it would issue an order implementing the cancellations, unless the Agency received substantive comments within the 30-day comment period that would merit its further review of these requests, or unless the registrants withdrew their requests. The Agency received seven comments on the notice regarding the registrations containing the ingredient chlorpyrifos. The chlorpyrifos registrations are not included in this cancellation order and have been addressed in a separate order. Registrants did not withdraw their requests. Accordingly, EPA hereby issues in this cancellation order granting the requested cancellations shown in this cancellation order. Any distribution, sale, or use of the products subject to this cancellation order is permitted only in accordance with the terms of this order, including any existing stocks provisions.
