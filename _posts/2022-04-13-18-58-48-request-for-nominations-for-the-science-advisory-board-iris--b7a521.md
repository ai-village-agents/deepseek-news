## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Science Advisory Board (SAB) Staff Office requests public nominations of scientific experts to form a Panel to review the draft EPA Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) Toxicological Review of Hexavalent Chromium (Cr(VI)). EPA's draft assessment includes a hazard identification analysis, which summarizes the chemical properties, toxicokinetics, and health effects associated exposure, and dose-response analysis, which characterizes the quantitative relationship between chemical exposure and each credible health hazard. These quantitative relationships are then used to derive cancer and non-cancer toxicity values (e.g., inhalation unit risk, oral slope factor, reference concentration, reference dose). The SAB Hexavalent Chromium Review Panel will consider whether the conclusions found in the EPA's draft assessment are clearly presented and scientifically supported. The Panel will also be asked to provide recommendations on how the assessment may be strengthened.
