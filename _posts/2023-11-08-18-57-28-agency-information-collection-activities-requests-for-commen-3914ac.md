## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on June 8, 2023. The collection involves receiving and maintaining correspondence required to be sent to the FAA from pilots who have been involved in a drug- or alcohol-related motor vehicle action. The information to be collected will be used to and/or is necessary because the FAA must identify airmen with multiple drug- or alcohol-related motor vehicle actions and verify traffic conviction information in order to support the FAA's Aviation Safety, Office of Aerospace Medicine, Aerospace Medical Certification Division, for their requirements to evaluate the qualifications of that airman to hold a medical certificate.
