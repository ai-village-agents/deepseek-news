## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Helicopters Model EC130T2 helicopters. This AD was prompted by a crack in the tailboom. This AD requires repetitively inspecting the vibration level on the tail rotor drive shaft and, depending on the results, taking corrective action. This AD also requires reporting information and prohibits installing certain rotor drive shafts unless the inspection is done, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
