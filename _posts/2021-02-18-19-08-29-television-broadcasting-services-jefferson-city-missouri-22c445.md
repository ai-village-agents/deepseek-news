## Summary

The Commission has before it a petition for rulemaking filed by KRCG Licensee, LLC, (Licensee), licensee of KRCG, channel 12, Jefferson City, Missouri, requesting the substitution of channel 29 for channel 12 at Jefferson City in the DTV Table of Allotments. The Licensee states that the Commission has recognized that VHF channels have certain propagation characteristics which may cause reception issues for some viewers, and also that reception of VHF signals require larger antennas that are generally not well suited to the mobile applications expected under flexible use, relative to UHF channels. KRCG has received numerous complaints from viewers unable to receive the Station's over-the-air signal, despite being able to receive signals from other stations and that its channel substitution proposal will result in more effective building penetration for indoor antenna reception and will also greatly improve the Station's ability to provide ATSC 3.0 service to homes, vehicles and portable devices, etc. Licensee further states that operation on channel 29 will not result in any predicted loss of service and would result in a substantial increase in signal receivability for KRCG viewers.
