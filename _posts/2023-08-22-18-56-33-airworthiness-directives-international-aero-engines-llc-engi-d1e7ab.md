## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain International Aero Engines, LLC (IAE LLC) Model PW1122G-JM, PW1124G1-JM, PW1124G-JM, PW1127G-JM, PW1127G1-JM, PW1127GA-JM, PW1129G- JM, PW1130G-JM, PW1133G-JM, PW1133GA-JM, PW1428G-JM, PW1428GA-JM, PW1428GH-JM, PW1431G-JM, PW1431GA-JM, and PW1431GH-JM engines. This AD was prompted by an updated analysis of an event involving an IAE LLC Model PW1127GA-JM engine, which experienced a high-pressure compressor (HPC) 7th-stage integrally bladed rotor (IBR-7) separation that resulted in an aborted takeoff. This AD requires performing an ultrasonic inspection (USI) of the high-pressure turbine (HPT) 1st- stage hub and HPT 2nd-stage hub for cracks and, depending on the results of the inspections, replacing the HPT 1st-stage hub or HPT 2nd- stage hub. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
