## Summary

This document announces the 1-year extension of the timeline for publication of the final rule. Section 1871(a)(3)(A) of the Social Security Act (the Act) requires us to establish and publish a regular timeline for the publication of final regulations based on the previous publication of a proposed regulation. Section 1871(a)(3)(B) of the Act allows us to extend the timeline for publication of the final rule by publishing a Federal Register document which includes a brief explanation of the justification for the variation in the timeline.
