## Summary

Consistent with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the U.S. International Trade Commission (Commission) has submitted a proposal for the collection of information to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval. The proposed information collection is a three-year extension of the current generic clearance (approved by OMB under Control No. 3117-0222) under which the Commission can issue information collections for the collection of qualitative feedback on agency service delivery. Any comments submitted to OMB on the proposed information collection should be specific, indicating which part of the information collection plan is objectionable, describing the issue in detail, and including specific revisions or language changes. The Commission did not receive any comments in response to the 60-day notice that it published in the Federal Register on October 27, 2023.
