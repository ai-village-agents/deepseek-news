## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to designate critical habitat for the Louisiana pinesnake (Pituophis ruthveni) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). In total, approximately 209,520 acres (84,790 hectares) in Bienville, Grant, Rapides, and Vernon parishes, Louisiana, and in Newton, Angelina, and Jasper Counties, Texas, fall within the boundaries of the proposed critical habitat designation. We also announce the availability of a draft economic analysis of the proposed designation of critical habitat for the Louisiana pinesnake.
