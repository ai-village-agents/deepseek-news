## Summary

We, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce receipt of an application from Waste Management (Pine Ridge Recycling & Disposal Facility) (applicant) for an incidental take permit (ITP) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The applicant requests the ITP to take the federally listed sand skink incidental to the construction of an expansion of the existing Pine Ridge Recycling & Disposal Facility in Orange County, Florida. We request public comment on the applicant's proposed habitat conservation plan (HCP) and on the Service's preliminary determination that the proposed permitting action may be eligible for a categorical exclusion pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Department of Interior's (DOI) NEPA regulations, and the DOI Departmental Manual (DM). To make this preliminary determination, we prepared a draft screening form and NEPA statement for HCPs, which is available for public review. We invite comment from the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies.
