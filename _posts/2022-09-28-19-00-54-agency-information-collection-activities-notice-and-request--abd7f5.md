## Summary

NHTSA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for an extension with modification of a currently approved information collection. Before a federal agency can collect certain information from the public, it must receive approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Under procedures established by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, before seeking OMB approval, Federal agencies must solicit public comment on proposed collections of information, including extensions and reinstatement of previously approved collections. This document describes collections of information for which NHTSA intends to seek OMB approval that collect for NHTSA's Crash Report Sampling System (CRSS), Non-Traffic Surveillance (NTS), and special studies.
