## Summary

This action modifies Area Navigation (RNAV) Route (T-333) in the western United States. The modification is necessary due to the planned decommissioning of the Priest, CA, VOR navigation aid (NAVAID), which provides navigation guidance for portions of affected ATS route V-485. The decommissioning has rendered portions of V-485 unusable and amending T-333 will overcome affected portions of V-485. The Priest, CA, VOR is being decommissioned as part of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
