## Summary

The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC" or "Commission") adopts amendments to the Telemarketing Sales Rule ("TSR") that, among other things, require telemarketers and sellers to maintain additional records of their telemarketing transactions, prohibit material misrepresentations and false or misleading statements in business to business ("B2B") telemarketing calls, and add a new definition for the term "previous donor." These amendments are necessary to address technological advances and to continue protecting consumers, including small businesses, from deceptive or abusive telemarketing practices.
