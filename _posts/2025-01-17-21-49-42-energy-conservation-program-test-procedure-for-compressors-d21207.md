# Energy Conservation Program: Test Procedure for Compressors

## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is amending the test procedure for compressors to correct an error and to ensure that pressure ratio is expressed in terms of absolute pressure. DOE is also correcting the formula for isentropic efficiency and specific energy consumption of the packaged compressor by incorporating a K<INF>6</INF> correction factor to correct for differences in pressure ratio when testing at differing elevations. Finally, DOE is amending the definition of "air compressor" to include a minor clarification and revise a typographical error.
