## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC or Commission) is proposing regulations to ensure clearing member funds and assets receive the proper treatment in the event the derivatives clearing organization (DCO) enters bankruptcy by requiring, among other things, that clearing member funds be segregated from the DCO's own funds and held in a depository that acknowledges in writing that the funds belong to clearing members, not the DCO. In addition, the Commission is proposing to permit DCOs to hold customer and clearing member funds at foreign central banks subject to certain requirements. Finally, the Commission is proposing to require DCOs to conduct a daily calculation and reconciliation of the amount of funds owed to customers and clearing members and the amount actually held for customers and clearing members.
