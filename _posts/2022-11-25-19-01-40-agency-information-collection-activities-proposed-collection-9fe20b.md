## Summary

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, invites the general public to take this opportunity to comment on this extension with change of a currently approved information collection. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice seeks comments concerning the removal of use of the FEMA Form FF-USFA- FY-21-108 (formerly 119-17-2), Request for Use of NETC Facilities due to its antiquated information collection method and requirement. There is no longer a need to formally require the use of this form in order for a requestor to receive support for special groups using the National Emergency Training Center (NETC).
