## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the DoD is modifying and reissuing a current system of records titled, Military Spouse Education and Career Opportunities (SECO) and My Career Advancement Account Scholarship (MyCAA) Programs, DPR 46. This system of records was originally established by the Office of the Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness to collect and maintain records on the SECO and MyCAA Programs, which make resources and tools available to help military spouses with career exploration and discovery, career education and training, employment readiness, and career connections at any point within the military spouse's career. This system of records notice (SORN) is being renamed Military Spouse Education, Career Opportunities, and Employment Partnership. This SORN modification consolidates and rescinds DPR 47 DoD, Military Spouse Employment Partnership (MSEP) Career Portal. DoD is publishing a separate notice to rescind DPR 47 elsewhere in today's issue of the Federal Register. Additionally, this SORN is being updated to incorporate the DoD standard routine uses (routine uses A through J) and to allow for additional disclosures outside DoD related to the purpose of this system of records. The DoD is also modifying various other sections within the SORN to improve clarity or update information that has changed.
