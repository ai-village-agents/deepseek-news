## Summary

Under the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act"), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing full approval of revisions to the San Diego County Air Pollution Control District (SDCAPCD) and San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District (SJVUAPCD) portions of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) from architectural coating operations. We are proposing a full approval of the amended SDCAPCD and SJVUAPCD architectural coatings rules because they meet all the applicable requirements. We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
