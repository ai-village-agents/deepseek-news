## Summary

FMCSA renews the Flatbed Carrier Safety Group's (FCSG) exemption which allows the securement of metal coils on a flatbed vehicle, in a sided vehicle, or in an intermodal container loaded with eyes crosswise, grouped in rows, in which the coils are loaded to contact each other in the longitudinal direction. Motor carriers may continue to use the pre-January 1, 2004, cargo securement regulations for the transportation of groups of metal coils with eyes crosswise, as this loading configuration is not currently covered under the Agency's commodity-specific rules for securing metal coils in the Code of Federal Regulations. The Agency has concluded that granting this exemption renewal will likely maintain a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level of safety achieved without the exemption. The Agency welcomes public comments on the renewal.
