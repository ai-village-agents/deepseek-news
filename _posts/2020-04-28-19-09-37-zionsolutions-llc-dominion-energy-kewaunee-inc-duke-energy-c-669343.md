## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued four exemptions in response to requests from ZionSolutions LLC; Dominion Energy Kewaunee, Inc.; and Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC. The exemptions allow the licensees to deviate from the requirements for the MAGNASTOR[supreg] storage cask system in Certificate of Compliance No. 1031, Amendment No. 7 (for Catawba and McGuire) and Amendment No. 6 (for Zion and Kewaunee), by utilizing two exceptions to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. The NRC is issuing a single notice to announce the issuance of these exemptions because these are nearly identical.
