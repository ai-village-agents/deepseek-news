## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) adopts rules to reform the use of the 3.7-4.2 GHz band, also known as the C-Band. By repacking existing satellite operations into the upper 200 megahertz of the band (and reserving a 20 megahertz guard band), the Commission makes 280 megahertz of spectrum available for flexible use throughout the contiguous United States, and does so in a manner that ensures the continuous and uninterrupted delivery of services currently offered in the band. The Commission will hold a public auction to ensure that the public recovers a substantial portion of the value of this resource. And the Commission schedules that auction for later this year, with a robust transition schedule to ensure that a significant amount of spectrum is made available quickly for upcoming 5G deployments. This action is the next critical step in advancing American leadership in 5G and implementing the Commission's comprehensive 5G FAST Plan. The Commission modified the Report and Order released on March 3, 2020 with an erratum released on March 27, 2020 and a second erratum released on April 16, 2020. The changes from the first and second errata are included in this document.
