## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all BAE Systems (Operations) Limited Model 4101 airplanes. This AD was prompted by in-service cracking of the passenger door edge member, seal carrier, and inner skin, adjacent to the roller guide bracket. This AD requires a one-time inspection of the external visible surface of the inner skin, door edge member, and seal carrier adjacent to the roller bracket attachment brackets; and the inner skin, door edge member, and seal carrier at the roller bracket attachment bore, and repair if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
