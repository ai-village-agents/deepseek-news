## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to approve a revision to the Alaska State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted on May 16, 2022. In the submission, Alaska revised and repealed state regulations originally put in place to limit water vapor emissions that may contribute to ice fog and to address the use of high-sulfur marine fuels near the communities of St. Paul Island and Unalaska. Alaska determined that the regulations are now obsolete due to technology improvements and regulatory changes, including Federal sulfur content in fuel restrictions, and Alaska requested that the SIP be updated to reflect the revised and repealed state regulations. We propose to find that the submitted revision will not interfere with attainment of the national ambient air quality standards or other applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act.
