## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone while the U.S. Navy Blue Angels Squadron conducts aerobatic performances over Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii.

This rulemaking prohibits persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port (COTP) Sector Honolulu or a designated representative.
