The U.S. Army Reserve’s 88th Readiness Division (RD) Directorate of Public Works (DPW) is knocking down data silos to create a new robust facilities management dashboard. Partnering with other staff sections and stakeholders, the 88th RD is consolidating reporting components to create a single robust facilities common operating picture (COP) tool that can also be used across the Army Reserve enterprise.
