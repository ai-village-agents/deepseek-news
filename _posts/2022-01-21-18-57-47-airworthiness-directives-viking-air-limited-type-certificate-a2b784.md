## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Viking Air Limited (Viking) (type certificate previously held by Bombardier Inc. and de Havilland, Inc.) Model DHC-6-1, DHC-6-100, DHC-6-200, DHC-6-300, and DHC-6-400 airplanes. This proposed AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as cracks and corrosion damage to the aileron internal structure. This proposed AD would require visually inspecting the entire aileron internal structure, correcting any damage found, and reporting the inspection results to Viking. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
