## Summary

The Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (Permitting Council) has voted to add mining as a sector with infrastructure projects eligible for coverage under Title 41 of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST-41). A new part will be included in the Code of Federal Regulations that adds mining to the list of statutory FAST-41 sectors. The addition of mining as a FAST-41 sector will allow qualified mining infrastructure projects to become FAST-41 covered projects. FAST-41 coverage will help Federal agencies coordinate their environmental and project review efforts to improve the timeliness, efficiency, predictability, and transparency of the decision-making processes associated with covered mining projects. The designation of mining as a FAST-41 sector does not predetermine or affect any Federal agency decision with respect to any mining authorization or permit application, nor does it sidestep any required environmental review or public consultation process.
