## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose revising regulations governing the annual Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp Contest (also known as the Federal Duck Stamp Contest (Contest)). Our proposed amendments would specify a permanent theme and the mandatory inclusion of an appropriate hunting element beginning with the 2020 Contest, make a permanent change to the qualifications of the judging panel, and remove references to the 2018 Contest.
