## Summary

On April 27, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), located within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), published a notice in the Federal Register announcing an extension of the deadline for annual reporting of data submitted for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products, respectively, under the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (FCLAA) and the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act (CSTHEA). CDC announced this extension due to the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. CDC has since re-evaluated this extension and determined that data submissions can recommence. Required ingredient reports and nicotine analysis reports must be submitted to CDC on or before March 31, 2024.
