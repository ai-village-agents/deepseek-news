## Summary

The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) is revising its practice in setting the initial period of time to answer or submit an acceptable response to a complaint in a TTAB trial proceeding as a result of a re-calculation of time to respond to a provisional refusal pursuant to the Madrid Protocol. Currently, TTAB's established time period for response is forty (40) days from the notice of institution of the TTAB proceeding ("institution order"). The period to file a response is now revised to sixty (60) days from the date of the institution order. This amendment has no impact or effect on the current TTAB Rules of Procedure.
