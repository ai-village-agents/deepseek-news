## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-2B16 (601-3A, 601-3R, and 604 Variants) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report indicating that a new filter plate connector for the nose wheel steering (NWS) system electronic control module (ECM) does not meet certain certification requirements. This proposed AD would require replacing all affected non-compliant ECMs. This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
