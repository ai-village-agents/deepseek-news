## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A318, A319, A320, and A321 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that a batch of main landing gear (MLG) aft pintle pins did not have nickel plating applied to the inner bore during manufacturing. This AD requires replacing affected parts with serviceable parts and also prohibits the installation of affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
