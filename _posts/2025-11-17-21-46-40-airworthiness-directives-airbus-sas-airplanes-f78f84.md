## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-05- 13, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A300 B4-600, B4-600R, and F4- 600R series airplanes; and Model A300 C4-605R Variant F airplanes (collectively called Model A300-600 series airplanes). AD 2023-05-13 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2023-05-13, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2023-05-13 and requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
