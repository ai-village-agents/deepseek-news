## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing approval of a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of South Carolina, through the South Carolina Department of Environmental Services (SCDES, formerly the "South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control"), on September 26, 2023. The SIP revision includes the State's plan for maintaining the 2008 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) through 2036 for the South Carolina portion of the bi-state Charlotte-Rock Hill, North Carolina-South Carolina 2008 8-hour ozone nonattainment area (the entire area is hereinafter referred to as the "bi-State Charlotte Area" and the South Carolina portion is hereinafter referred to as the "York County Area"). EPA is approving and incorporating this maintenance plan, including the 2018 and 2036 motor vehicle emission budgets (budgets) for nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) for the York County Area, into the SIP. EPA is finalizing approval because the York County Area maintenance plan provides for the maintenance of the 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS within the Area through the end of the second 10-year portion of the maintenance period. Additionally, EPA finds the 2018 and 2036 budgets for the York County Area adequate for the purposes of transportation conformity.
