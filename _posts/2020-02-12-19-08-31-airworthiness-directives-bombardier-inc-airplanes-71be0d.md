## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2003-09-04 R1, which applied to certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-2B19 (Regional Jet series 100 & 440) airplanes. AD 2003-09-04 R1 required revising the airworthiness limitations for certain structural inspections; repair if necessary; and submission of inspection findings to the airplane manufacturer. This AD revises the applicability to include additional airplanes; revises certain compliance times; and requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. This AD was prompted by a report of fatigue cracks occurring on the pressure floor skin at fuselage stations (FS) 460 and 513. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
