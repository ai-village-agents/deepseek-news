## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") is adopting amendments to a rule under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Act" or "Exchange Act") that exempts certain Commission- registered brokers or dealers from membership in a registered national securities association ("Association"). The amendments replace rule provisions that provide an exemption for proprietary trading with narrower exemptions from Association membership for any registered broker or dealer that is a member of a national securities exchange, carries no customer accounts, and effects transactions in securities otherwise than on a national securities exchange of which it is a member. The amendments create exemptions for such a registered broker or dealer that effects securities transactions otherwise than on an exchange of which it is a member that result solely from orders that are routed by a national securities exchange of which it is a member to comply with order protection regulatory requirements, or are solely for the purpose of executing the stock leg of a stock-option order.
