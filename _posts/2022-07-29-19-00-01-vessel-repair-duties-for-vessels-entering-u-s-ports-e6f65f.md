# Vessel Repair Duties for Vessels Entering U.S. Ports

## Summary

This rule amends U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regulations to streamline the vessel repair entry process by extending the timeframe from 90 days to 150 days for vessel owners, masters, or authorized agents ("vessel operators") to provide completed vessel repair entries and to apply for relief from assessment of those vessel repair duties. Because CBP is extending the timeframe from 90 days to 150 days, CBP is also eliminating provisions that allow for requests for an additional 30-day extension to submit all of the relevant evidence as those extensions are no longer necessary.
