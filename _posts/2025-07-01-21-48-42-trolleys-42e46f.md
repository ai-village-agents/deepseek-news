## Summary

MSHA is proposing to remove and revise provisions for metal and nonmental (MNM) mines and coal mines regarding the use of trolleys for transportation of mined ore, coal, material, and personnel. Trolleys are an outdated technology that have been replaced by more efficient belt conveyor haulage systems for transporting mined ore and coal. Diesel and battery-operated mobile equipment are now used to transport personnel and equipment. Trolleys are no longer used in MNM or coal mines and there is no anticipated future use of this legacy equipment in MNM and coal mines.
