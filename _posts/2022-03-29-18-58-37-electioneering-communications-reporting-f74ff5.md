## Summary

The Commission announces its disposition of a petition for rulemaking filed on October 5, 2012, by the Center for Individual Freedom. The petition asks that the Commission revise two regulations on the reporting of electioneering communications. The Commission has decided not to initiate a rulemaking in response to the petition because the regulatory changes it sought have already been implemented in a separate rulemaking. The petition and other documents relating to this matter are available on the Commission's website, https:// www.fec.gov/fosers/ (REG 2012-01 Electioneering Communications Reporting).
