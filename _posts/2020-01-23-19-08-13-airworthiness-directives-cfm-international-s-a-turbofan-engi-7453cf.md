## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all CFM International S.A. (CFM) LEAP-1B21, -1B23, -1B25, -1B27, - 1B28, -1B28B1, -1B28B2, -1B28B2C, -1B28B3, -1B28BBJ1, and -1B28BBJ2 model turbofan engines. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of two new unsafe conditions and the need to supersede corrective actions for two previously addressed unsafe conditions. The FAA proposes to supersede AD 2018-25-09 and AD 2019-12-01, which apply to the affected LEAP-1B model turbofan engines. Since the FAA issued the ADs, the FAA received information and analysis indicating that supersedure of these ADs is warranted.
