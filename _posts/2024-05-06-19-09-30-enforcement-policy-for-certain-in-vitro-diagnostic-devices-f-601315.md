## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of the draft guidance entitled "Enforcement Policy for Certain In Vitro Diagnostic Devices for Immediate Public Health Response in the Absence of a Declaration under Section 564." In the context of emergent situations involving chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) threats, there may be a public health need for certain in vitro diagnostic devices (IVDs) to be available for immediate response purposes. When finalized, this guidance will describe the Agency's enforcement policy for certain laboratory manufacturers offering certain unauthorized IVDs for immediate response to CBRN agents in the absence of a declaration applicable to IVDs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). This draft guidance is not final nor is it for implementation at this time.
