This action amends Very High Frequency (VHF) Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-50, V-52, V-63, and V-586, and revokes VOR Federal airway V-582. The FAA is taking this action due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Quincy, IL (UIN), VOR/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) navigational aid (NAVAID). The Quincy VOR is being decommissioned in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
