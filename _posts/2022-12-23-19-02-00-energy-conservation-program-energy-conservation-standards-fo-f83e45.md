## Summary

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended ("EPCA"), prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment, including commercial warm air furnaces ("CWAFs"). EPCA also requires the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE" or "the Department") to periodically review standards to determine whether more-stringent, amended standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would result in significant additional energy savings. In the case of CWAFs, DOE has determined that it lacks clear and convincing evidence that amended energy conservation standards would be economically justified. As such, in this final determination, DOE has determined not to amend the energy conservation standards for CWAFs.
