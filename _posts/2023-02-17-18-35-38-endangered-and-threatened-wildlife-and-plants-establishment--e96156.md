## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to establish a nonessential experimental population (NEP) of the gray wolf (Canis lupus) in the State of Colorado, under section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The State of Colorado (Colorado Parks and Wildlife or CPW) requested that the Service establish an NEP in conjunction with their State-led gray wolf reintroduction effort. Establishment of this NEP would provide for allowable, legal, purposeful, and incidental taking of the gray wolf within a defined NEP area while concurrently providing for the conservation of the species. The geographic boundaries of the NEP would include the State of Colorado. The best available data indicate that reintroduction of the gray wolf into Colorado is biologically feasible and will promote the conservation of the species. We are seeking comments on this proposal and on our associated draft environmental impact statement (DEIS), prepared pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, which describes the potential alternatives for providing a regulatory framework for the State's reintroduction.
