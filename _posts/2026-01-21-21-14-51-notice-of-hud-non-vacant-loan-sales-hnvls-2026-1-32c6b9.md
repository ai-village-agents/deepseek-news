## Summary

This notice announces HUD's intention to offer approximately 2,500 home equity conversion mortgages (HECM, or reverse mortgage loans) secured by occupied properties with a loan balance of approximately $730 million. The sale will consist of due and payable Secretary-held reverse mortgage loans. The mortgage loans consist of first liens secured by real property that is occupied, where the borrower and any borrowing or non-borrowing spouse are deceased, and heirs have not come forward in the time elapsed. This initiative supports HUD's continued efforts to reduce financial risk to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund and promote the efficient disposition of defaulted assets. Additional information regarding sale structure, loan pool composition, and bidding procedures will be provided in subsequent announcements. This notice also generally describes the bidding process for the sale and certain entities who are ineligible to bid. This is the second sale offering of its type and is scheduled for February 10, 2026.
