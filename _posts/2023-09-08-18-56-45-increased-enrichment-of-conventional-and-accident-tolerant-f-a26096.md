## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is requesting comments on a regulatory basis to support a rulemaking to amend the NRC's regulations related to the use of conventional and accident tolerant light-water reactor fuel designs. The NRC's goal is to establish effective and efficient licensing of applications using fuels enriched to greater than 5.0 and less than 20.0 weight percent uranium- 235. The NRC will hold a public meeting to promote a full understanding of the planned rulemaking and facilitate public comment on the regulatory basis.
