## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes, Model A319-111, - 112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, - 112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that cracks were found on the web horizontal flange and inner cap on frame (FR) 68, left-hand (LH) and right-hand (RH) side, at stringer (STGR) 22. This proposed AD would require repetitive high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections for cracks on the web horizontal flange and inner cap on FR 68, LH and RH side at STGR 22, and applicable corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
