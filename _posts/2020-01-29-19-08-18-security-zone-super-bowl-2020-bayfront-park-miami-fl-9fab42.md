## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary security zone over certain navigable waters of Biscayne Bay during Super Bowl 2020 events in Miami, Florida. The security zone is necessary to protect the official party, public, and surrounding waterway from terrorist acts, sabotage or other subversive acts, accidents, or other hazards of a similar nature. This regulation requires vessels transit through the security zone at a steady speed and not stop or anchor unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Miami (COTP) or a designated representative.
