## Summary

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended ("EPCA"), prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment, including room air conditioners. EPCA also requires the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") to periodically determine whether more-stringent standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would result in significant energy savings. In this notice of proposed rulemaking ("NOPR"), DOE proposes amended energy conservation standards for room air conditioners, and also announces a webinar to receive comment on these proposed standards and associated analyses and results.
