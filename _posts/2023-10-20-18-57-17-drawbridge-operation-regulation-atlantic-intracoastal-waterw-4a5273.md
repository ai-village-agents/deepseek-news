## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to temporarily modify the operating schedule that governs the Indiantown Road Bridge across the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway (AICW), mile 1006.2, at Jupiter, Florida. This action is necessary to alleviate vehicle traffic congestion on the Indiantown Road Bridge caused by the replacement and closure of a nearby bridge. Once construction of the nearby bridge has been completed, the Indiantown Road Drawbridge will return to normally scheduled operations. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
