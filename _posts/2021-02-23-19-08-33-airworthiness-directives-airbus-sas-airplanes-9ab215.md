## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; Model A319-111, A319-112, A319- 113, A319-114, A319-115, A319-131, A319-132, A319-133, A319-151N, and A319-153N airplanes; Model A320 series airplanes; and Model A321 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by the results of laboratory tests on non-rechargeable lithium batteries installed in emergency locator transmitters (ELT), which highlighted a lack of protection against certain currents that could lead to thermal runaway and a battery fire. This AD requires modifying a certain ELT by installing a diode in the airplane circuit connecting the ELT battery, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
