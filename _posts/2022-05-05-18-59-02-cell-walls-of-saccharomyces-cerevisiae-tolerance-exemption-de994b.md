## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of cell walls of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (also known as yeast cell walls or YCWs) when used as a carrier inert ingredient in pesticide formulations in pre-harvest applications to crops. SciReg, Inc., on behalf of Eden Research, submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of cell walls of Saccharomyces cerevisiae on food or feed commodities when used in accordance with this exemption.
