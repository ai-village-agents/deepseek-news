## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering the issuance of a multi-site service provider license to DISA Technologies, Inc. (DISA) for the operation of its high-pressure slurry ablation (HPSA) technology to remediate abandoned uranium mine (AUM) waste. DISA's request is to use the HPSA technology to perform remediation at certain AUM waste sites after additional site-specific safety and environmental information is provided to and approved by the NRC. The NRC staff is issuing a generic environmental assessment (EA) and finding of no significant impact (FONSI) associated with the proposed licensing action.
