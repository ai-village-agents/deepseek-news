## Summary

Pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) signed an Order, dated December 11, 2020, granting a petition to object to a state operating permit issued by the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE). The Order responds to a February 4, 2019 petition, relating to the Northeast Maryland Waste Disposal Authority's Montgomery County Resource Recovery Facility (MCRRF), a municipal solid waste resource recovery facility located in Montgomery County, Maryland. The petition was submitted by the Environmental Integrity Project and the Chesapeake Climate Action Network (the Petitioners). This Order constitutes final action on that petition requesting that the Administrator object to the issuance of the proposed CAA title V permit.
