## Summary

The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) proposes to amend a loan reamorization rule that requires payment of all accrued interest prior to allowing payments on the principal and current interest. Under the proposed rule, the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) record keeper would combine the accrued interest with the outstanding principal when reamortizing a loan.
