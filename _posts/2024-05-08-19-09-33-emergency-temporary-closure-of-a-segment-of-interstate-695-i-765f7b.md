## Summary

The Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA) closed Interstate 695 (I-695) in both directions over the Patapsco River, which provides access to the Baltimore Harbor and the Port of Baltimore, on March 26, 2024, due to the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge. The MDTA is the owner of the bridge. It is a modal administration under the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT). The MDTA is continuing the temporary closure of this segment of I-695 for an indefinite period of time until the damaged bridge can be reconstructed. The FHWA is providing notice in the Federal Register that the FHWA is approving an emergency deletion of this segment of I-695 from the National Network (NN), in accordance with applicable regulations, due to safety considerations and the emergency closure resulting from the bridge and other infrastructure damage, as discussed in this notice. The FHWA is also requesting comments from the public for 30 days on the alternate routes selected by MDTA due to the closure.
