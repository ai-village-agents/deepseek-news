## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is withdrawing approval of five abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) from multiple holders of those ANDAs. The basis for the withdrawal is that these ANDA holders have repeatedly failed to file required annual reports for those ANDAs and have failed to satisfy the requirement to have an approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS).
