## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve the regional haze state implementation plan (SIP) submitted by the State of New York through the Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC or New York) on May 12, 2020, as satisfying applicable requirements under the Clean Air Act (CAA) and the EPA's Regional Haze Rule for the program's second implementation period. New York's SIP submission addresses the requirement that states must periodically revise their long-term strategies for making reasonable progress towards the national goal of preventing any future, and remedying any existing, anthropogenic impairment of visibility in mandatory Class I Federal areas, including regional haze. The SIP submission also addresses other applicable requirements for the second implementation period of the regional haze program. The EPA is taking this action pursuant to sections 110 and 169A of the Clean Air Act.
