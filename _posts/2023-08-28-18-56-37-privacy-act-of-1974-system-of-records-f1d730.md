## Summary

The Department of the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is issuing a public notice of its intent to rescind the Integrated Real Estate Management System (iREMS). During a routine review of Multifamily Housing system of records notices, it was determined that this system of records is no longer necessary because personally identifiable information is not used in the retrieval process of the iREMS system.
