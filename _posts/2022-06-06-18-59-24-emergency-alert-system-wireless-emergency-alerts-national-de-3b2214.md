## Summary

In this document, the Commission announces that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved information collections associated with certain rules adopted in the Report and Order. The Commission also announces that compliance with the rules is now required. The Commission also removes paragraphs advising that compliance was not required until OMB approval was obtained. This document is consistent with the NDAA21 Alerting Order and rules, which state the Commission will publish a document in the Federal Register announcing a compliance date for the rule sections and revise the rules accordingly.
