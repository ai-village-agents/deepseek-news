## Summary

This temporary rule sets Atlantic bluefin tuna (BFT) General category restricted-fishing days (RFDs) for all Tuesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays from July 1 through November 30, 2023. On an RFD, Atlantic Tunas General category permitted vessels may not fish for (including catch-and-release or tag-and-release fishing), possess, retain, land, or sell BFT. On an RFD, HMS Charter/Headboat permitted vessels with a commercial sale endorsement also are subject to these restrictions and may not fish commercially for BFT under the General category restrictions and retention limits, but such vessels may still fish for, possess, retain, or land BFT when fishing recreationally under applicable HMS Angling category rules. NMFS may waive previously scheduled RFDs under certain circumstances, but will not modify the previously scheduled RFDs during the fishing year in other ways (such as changing an RFD from one date to another or adding RFDs).
