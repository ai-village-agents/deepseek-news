## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Viking Air Limited (type certificate previously held by Bombardier Inc. and de Havilland, Inc.) Model DHC-3 airplanes. This AD was prompted by multiple recent reports of cracks in the left-hand elevator auxiliary spar. This AD requires repetitive detailed visual inspections of the entire left-hand elevator auxiliary spar for cracks, corrosion, and previous repairs, and depending on the findings, replacement of the left-hand elevator auxiliary spar. This AD also requires sending the inspection results to the FAA. The FAA previously sent an emergency AD to all known U.S. owners and operators of these airplanes and is now issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
