## Summary

This action proposes to amend Very High Frequency (VHF) Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-20, V-222, V-289, V-552, V-569, and V-574, and establish United States Area Navigation (RNAV) routes T-483 and T-485. The FAA is proposing this action due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Beaumont, TX (BPT), VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) navigational aid (NAVAID). The Beaumont VOR is being decommissioned in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
