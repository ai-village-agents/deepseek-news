## Summary

This document denies a petition for reconsideration submitted by Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, Center for Auto Safety, Consumer Reports, Consumer Federation of America, and Ms. Joan Claybrook (collectively, the "Petitioners") of a final rule amending NHTSA's regulation on temporary exemption from the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). The final rule eliminated the provision calling for the agency to determine that an application for a temporary exemption from any FMVSS or bumper standard or for a renewal of exemption is complete before the agency publishes a notification summarizing the application and soliciting public comments on it.
