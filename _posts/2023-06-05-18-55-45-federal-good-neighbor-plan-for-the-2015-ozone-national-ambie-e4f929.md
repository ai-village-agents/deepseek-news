## Summary

This action finalizes Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) requirements to address 23 states' obligations to eliminate significant contribution to nonattainment, or interference with maintenance, of the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) in other states. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking this action under the "good neighbor" or "interstate transport" provision of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act). The Agency is defining the amount of ozone-precursor emissions (specifically, nitrogen oxides) that constitute significant contribution to nonattainment and interference with maintenance from these 23 states. With respect to fossil fuel-fired power plants in 22 states, this action will prohibit those emissions by implementing an allowance-based trading program beginning in the 2023 ozone season. With respect to certain other industrial stationary sources in 20 states, this action will prohibit those emissions through emissions limitations and associated requirements beginning in the 2026 ozone season. These industrial source types are: reciprocating internal combustion engines in Pipeline Transportation of Natural Gas; kilns in Cement and Cement Product Manufacturing; reheat furnaces in Iron and Steel Mills and Ferroalloy Manufacturing; furnaces in Glass and Glass Product Manufacturing; boilers in Iron and Steel Mills and Ferroalloy Manufacturing, Metal Ore Mining, Basic Chemical Manufacturing, Petroleum and Coal Products Manufacturing, and Pulp, Paper, and Paperboard Mills; and combustors and incinerators in Solid Waste Combustors and Incinerators.
