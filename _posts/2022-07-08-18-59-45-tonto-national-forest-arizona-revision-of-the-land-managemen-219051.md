## Summary

The Forest Service is revising the Tonto National Forest's Land Management Plan and has prepared a final environmental impact statement (FEIS) for its revised Land Management Plan (LMP) and a draft record of decision (ROD). This notice is to inform the public that the Federal Register notice and legal notice posted on March 25, 2022, had an incorrect website to submit objections electronically through the comment analysis and response application (CARA). The correct website to submit an objection is listed below. This notice reinitiates the 60- day period where individuals or entities with specific concerns about the Tonto National Forest's revised LMP, draft ROD, and the associated FEIS may file objections for Forest Service review prior to plan approval. This is also an opportunity to object to the Regional Forester's list of species of conservation concern (SCC) for the Tonto National Forest. Those that submitted objections during the original objection period must resubmit their objections to be considered.
