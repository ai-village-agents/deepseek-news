## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) denies petitions for reconsideration of several aspects of the Commission's final rule setting compensation from the Telecommunications Relay Services (TRS) Fund for the provision of Internet Protocol Captioned Telephone Service (IP CTS). The document also denies a related request filed jointly by six IP CTS providers. In denying these petitions and requests, the Commission finds that they do not raise any new arguments or provide sufficient evidence that the Commission's initial treatment of the issues in question was incorrect or incomplete. Additionally, the Commission finds that it fully considered the issues, based its decision on the evidence in the record, and fully explained the rationale behind its decision.
