## Summary

This document amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regulations to reflect the addition of several categories of ethnological material of Peru to the existing import restrictions and to clarify descriptions of certain categories of archaeological and ethnological material of Peru. The United States has entered into an agreement with Peru that supersedes the prior agreement and amends the import restrictions that became effective on June 9, 2022. The restrictions, originally imposed by Treasury Decision 97-50, and recently extended by CBP Decision 22-11 for an additional five-year period, will continue with the addition of these categories of ethnological material through June 9, 2027, and the CBP regulations are being amended to reflect these additions. The Designated List of archaeological and ethnological material of Peru to which the restrictions apply is reproduced below.
