## Summary

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is conducting a study to evaluate increasing pumped storage hydropower (PSH) capacity within its power service area. To meet its obligations under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), TVA is preparing a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) to evaluate potential new PSH facilities at two locations in Jackson County, Alabama and expansion of the existing Raccoon Mountain PSH Plant in Marion County, Tennessee. Based on the findings of the PEIS, TVA may potentially select one or more sites as the need for long-duration energy storage increases. The PEIS will consider potential environmental and economic impacts from the construction and operation at each site.
