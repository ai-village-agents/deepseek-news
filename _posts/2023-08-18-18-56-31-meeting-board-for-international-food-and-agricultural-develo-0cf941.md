## Summary

The Board for International Food and Agricultural Development (BIFAD) (see https://www.usaid.gov/bifad), an advisory committee on food and agriculture issues to the US Agency for International Development (USAID), is hosting a full-day public meeting, Elevating Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation in USAID's Agricultural, Nutrition, and Food System Programming to Inform Strategy Implementation: A Discussion of the BIFAD Climate Change Subcommittee Draft Commissioned Report, to address the opportunities and challenges of transformational climate change adaptation and mitigation in USAID's agricultural, nutrition, and food systems programming. The meeting will highlight a draft commissioned report guided by the BIFAD Subcommittee on Systemic Solutions for Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation in Agriculture, Nutrition, and Food Systems, a subordinate unit of BIFAD established in June 2022 in response to a USAID request for advice on addressing the climate crisis in agricultural, nutrition, and food systems. The program will include Agency, stakeholder, and public insights and deliberation of draft recommendations from the report on integrating climate change adaptation and mitigation opportunities within USAID's agricultural, nutrition, and food system programming, research investments, and operational practices, as well as mobilizing climate finance for more resilient and sustainable food systems.
