# Airworthiness Directives; Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (Type Certificate Previously Held by Rolls-Royce Deutschland GmbH, Formerly BMW Rolls-Royce GmbH) Turbofan Engines

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) BR700-710A1-10, BR700-710A2-20 and BR700-710C4-11 model turbofan engines. This proposed AD was prompted by an investigation by RRD, which revealed a quality escape during the high-pressure turbine (HPT) stage 1 disk rim cooling air hole manufacturing process. This proposed AD would require removing affected HPT disks from service prior to reaching specified compliance times or at the next engine shop visit, whichever occurs first. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
