## Summary

This document contains proposed regulations regarding information reporting, the determination of amount realized and basis, and backup withholding, for certain digital asset sales and exchanges. Based on existing authority as well as changes to the applicable tax law made by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, these proposed regulations would require brokers, including digital asset trading platforms, digital asset payment processors, and certain digital asset hosted wallets, to file information returns, and furnish payee statements, on dispositions of digital assets effected for customers in certain sale or exchange transactions. These proposed regulations would also require real estate reporting persons, who are treated as brokers with respect to reportable real estate transactions, to include on filed information returns and furnished payee statements the fair market value of digital asset consideration received by real estate sellers in reportable real estate transactions. Additionally, these real estate reporting persons would also be required to file information returns and furnish payee statements with respect to real estate purchasers who use digital assets to acquire real estate in these transactions.
