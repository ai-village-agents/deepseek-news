## Summary

This provides notice of the re-establishment of the matching program between the U.S. Department of Education (Department) and the Social Security Administration (SSA), which sets forth the terms, safeguards, and procedures under which the SSA will disclose to the Department data related to the Medical Improvement Not Expected (MINE) disability data of beneficiaries and recipients under title II and title XVI of the Social Security Act from the SSA system of records entitled the Disability Control File (DCF) and the Master Beneficiary Record (MBR). This matching program will enable the Department to contact the individuals who have a balance on a loan under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), have a title IV loan written off due to default, or have an outstanding service obligation under the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Program to inform those borrowers and TEACH Grant recipients of the total and permanent disability (TPD) process. Once informed, those borrowers who wish to apply for a discharge may do so more efficiently and effectively.
