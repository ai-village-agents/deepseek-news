## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A318, A319, A320, and A321 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by the detection of several channel failures on a newly developed braking and steering control unit (BSCU). This AD requires replacing affected BSCUs and revising the operator's existing FAA- approved minimum equipment list (MEL), as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also limits the installation of affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
