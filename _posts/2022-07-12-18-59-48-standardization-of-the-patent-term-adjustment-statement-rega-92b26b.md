## Summary

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO or Office) proposes to revise the rules of practice pertaining to patent term adjustment to require that the patent term adjustment statement regarding information disclosure statements be submitted on an Office form. Use of the Office form will streamline certain aspects of prosecution by more accurately capturing and accounting for the patent term adjustment without unnecessary back-and-forth between the USPTO and applicant. It will also save resources by eliminating the need for a manual review of the patent term adjustment statement.
