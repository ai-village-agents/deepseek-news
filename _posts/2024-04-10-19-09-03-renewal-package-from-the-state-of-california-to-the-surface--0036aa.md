## Summary

This notice announces that FRA has received and reviewed a renewal package from the State of California (State) acting through the California State Transportation Agency (CalSTA) and California High- Speed Rail Authority (Authority) requesting renewed participation in the Surface Transportation Project Delivery Program (Program). Under the Program, FRA may assign, and the State may assume, responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and all or part of FRA's responsibilities for environmental review, consultation, or other actions required under any Federal environmental laws with respect to one or more railroad projects within the State. FRA has determined the renewal package to be complete, and developed a draft renewal MOU with CalSTA and the Authority outlining how the State will implement the Program with FRA oversight. The public is invited to comment on the State's request, including its renewal package and the proposed renewal MOU, which includes the proposed assignments and assumptions of environmental review, consultation, and other activities.
