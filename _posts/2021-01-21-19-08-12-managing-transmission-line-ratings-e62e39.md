## Summary

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) proposes to reform both the pro forma Open Access Transmission Tariff and the Commission's regulations under the Federal Power Act to improve the accuracy and transparency of transmission line ratings. Specifically, the proposal would require: Transmission providers to implement ambient-adjusted ratings on the transmission lines over which they provide transmission service; Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) and Independent System Operators (ISOs) to establish and implement the systems and procedures necessary to allow transmission owners to electronically update transmission line ratings at least hourly; and transmission owners to share transmission line ratings and transmission line rating methodologies with their respective transmission provider(s) and, in RTOs/ISOs, with their respective market monitor(s).
