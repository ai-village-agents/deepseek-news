## Summary

The FAA is superseding Emergency Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2025-23-51, which applied to all The Boeing Company Model MD-11 and MD- 11F airplanes. Emergency AD 2025-23-51 was prompted by an accident where the left-hand engine and pylon detached from the airplane during takeoff. Emergency AD 2025-23-51 prohibited further flight until the airplane is inspected and all applicable corrective actions are performed using a method approved by the FAA. Since the FAA issued Emergency AD 2025-23-51, the FAA has determined additional airplane models are subject to the same unsafe condition. This emergency AD continues to require the actions in AD 2025-23-51 and adds the Model MD-10-10F, MD-10-30F, DC-10-10, DC-10-10F, DC-10-15, DC-10-30, DC-10- 30F (KC-10A and KDC-10), DC-10-40, and DC-10-40F airplanes to the applicability. The FAA previously sent an emergency AD to all known U.S. owners and operators of these airplanes. The FAA is issuing this emergency AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
