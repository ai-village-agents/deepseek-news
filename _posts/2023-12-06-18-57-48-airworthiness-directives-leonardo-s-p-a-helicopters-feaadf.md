## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Leonardo S.p.a. Model AB412 and AB412 EP helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of cracks in the lateral mounts of the main transmission support case. This proposed AD would require repetitive visual inspections and fluorescent penetrant inspections (FPI) and, depending on the results, corrective action, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
