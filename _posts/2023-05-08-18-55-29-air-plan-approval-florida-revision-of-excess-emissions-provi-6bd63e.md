## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of Florida on November 22, 2016, and supplemented on September 30, 2022, through the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP). The November 22, 2016, SIP revision is in response to EPA's SIP call published on June 12, 2015, concerning excess emissions during startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) events. The September 30, 2022, supplemental SIP revision addresses additional SSM-related rule amendments identified by the State and the addition of source specific sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) and nitrogen oxide (NO<INF>X</INF>) emission limits. EPA proposes to find that Florida's SIP revisions provided November 22, 2016, and September 30, 2022, correct the deficiencies identified in EPA's 2015 SIP call, and thus is proposing to approve these SIP revisions.
