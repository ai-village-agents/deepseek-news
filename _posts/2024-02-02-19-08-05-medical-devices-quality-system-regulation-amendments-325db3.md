## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is issuing a final rule to amend the device current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements of the Quality System (QS) regulation to harmonize and modernize the regulation. We are harmonizing to align more closely with the international consensus standard for devices by converging with the quality management system (QMS) requirements used by other regulatory authorities from other jurisdictions (i.e., other countries). We are doing so by incorporating by reference an international standard specific for device quality management systems. Through this rulemaking we also establish additional requirements and make conforming edits to clarify the device CGMP requirements for such products. This action will continue our efforts to align our regulatory framework with that used by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions to promote consistency in the regulation of devices and provide timelier introduction of safe, effective, high-quality devices for patients.
