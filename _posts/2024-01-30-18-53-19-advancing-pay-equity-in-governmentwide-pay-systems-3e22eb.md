## Summary

The Office of Personnel Management is issuing final regulations governing the criteria for making salary determinations based on salary history to advance pay equity in the General Schedule, prevailing rate, Administrative Appeals Judge, Administrative Law Judge, Senior Executive Service, and senior-level and scientific or professional pay systems. For individuals receiving their first appointment as a civilian employee of the Federal Government (or a reappointment after a break in service) in one of these pay systems, agencies will not be able to set pay based on a job candidate's non- Federal salary or pay history, which could vary between equally qualified candidates, or based on a competing job offer. Agencies will also be required to have policies regarding setting pay based on a previous Federal salary for employees who have previous civilian service in the Federal Government.
