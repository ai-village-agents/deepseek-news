## Summary

The FAA is considering a proposal to change 1.423 acres of airport land from aeronautical use to non-aeronautical use of airport property located at Indianapolis International Airport, Indianapolis, Indiana. The aforementioned land is not needed for aeronautical use. The land is made up of one parcel and is located along the White River, just west of downtown Indianapolis, Indiana. It was the site of a decommissioned outer marker which has been removed and the land is vacant with no future aeronautical use. The Sponsor is proposing to release and ultimately sell the land to the City of Indianapolis in its revitalization efforts of Belmont Beach.
