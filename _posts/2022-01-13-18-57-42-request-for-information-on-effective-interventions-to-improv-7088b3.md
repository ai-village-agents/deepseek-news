The National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance (NCEE) at the U.S. Department of Education's (Department) Institute of Education Sciences (IES) is charged by Congress to identify and encourage the use of evidence-based practices in education. Through this request for information (RFI), NCEE seeks public input about the characteristics of middle school science and upper elementary mathematics interventions as well as information on publicly available research describing their efficacy. Feedback from developers of such interventions would be of particular value to the Department.
