## Summary

The Surface Transportation Board adopts a final rule to codify a longstanding voluntary practice whereby Class I carriers, through the Association of American Railroads (AAR), have annually reported tare weight and loss and damage data for use in the Board's Uniform Railroad Costing System (URCS). Under the final rule, Class I carriers may choose to provide tare weight and loss and damage data through AAR or to file the data with the Board individually.
