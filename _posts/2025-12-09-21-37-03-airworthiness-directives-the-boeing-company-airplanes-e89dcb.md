## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 787-9 and 787-10 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of multiple supplier notices of escapement (NOEs) documenting pressure deck splice fittings that were possibly manufactured with an incorrect titanium alloy material. This AD requires an inspection of the attach fittings and upper splice fitting of the stub beam horizontal pressure deck (HPD) to determine the type of titanium alloy material and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
