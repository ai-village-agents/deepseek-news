## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-17-02, which applies to all ATR--GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42-200, -300, and -320 airplanes. AD 2021-17- 02 requires a one-time inspection for discrepancies of the wire bundles between the left- and right-hand angle of attack (AOA) probes and the crew alerting computer, and, depending on findings, applicable corrective actions. AD 2021-17-02 also required for certain airplanes, modifying the captain stick shaker wiring, and for all airplanes, revising the existing aircraft flight manual (AFM) and applicable corresponding operational procedures to incorporate procedures for the stick pusher/shaker. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-17-02, a modification was developed to the affected wiring. This proposed AD would require installing a new AOA power supply unit and revising the existing AFM, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
