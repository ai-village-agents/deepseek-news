## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A300 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that indicated that bleed and air conditioning systems were contaminated by hydraulic fluid, and by an investigation that revealed that hydraulic fluid contaminations caused the failure of check valves installed on the hydraulic reservoir air pressurization system. This AD requires repetitive functional tests of the hydraulic reservoir air pressurization lines, and repair or replacement if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
