## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A320-271N, A321-211, and A321-271N airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of missing overhead stowage compartment (OHSC) X-fixation brackets or brackets that were incorrectly installed during assembly. This AD requires a special detailed inspection of the OHSC X-fixation brackets for missing or incorrectly installed brackets, and installation or replacement the OHSC X-fixation brackets if necessary; or modification of each OHSC; as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which will be incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
