## Summary

This regulation establishes exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of butoxypolypropylene glycol (BPG; [alpha]- butyl-[omega]-hydroxy-poly-oxy(methyl-1,2-ethanediyl) (CAS Reg. No. 9003-13-8)), oxirane, 2-methyl-, polymer with oxirane, mono-2-propen-1- yl ether (CAS Reg. No. 9041-33-2; polyether 1), poly(oxy-1,2- ethanediyl), [alpha]-acetyl-[omega]-(2-propen-1-yloxy)- (CAS Reg. No. 27252-87-5; polyether 2) and poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl), [alpha]-methyl- [omega]-(2-propen-1-yloxy)- (CAS Reg. No. 27252-80-8; polyether 3) when used as an inert ingredient in/on growing crops and raw agricultural commodities pre- and post-harvest and applied to animals. Spring Trading Company, on behalf of Evonik Corporation, submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting establishment of exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of BPG and polyethers 1, 2, and 3 when used in accordance with these exemptions.
