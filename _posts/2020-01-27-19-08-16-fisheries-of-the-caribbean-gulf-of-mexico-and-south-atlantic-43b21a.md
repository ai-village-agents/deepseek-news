## Summary

NMFS implements management measures described in Vision Blueprint Commercial Regulatory Amendment 27 (Regulatory Amendment 27) to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Snapper-Grouper Fishery of the South Atlantic Region (Snapper-Grouper FMP), as prepared and submitted by the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council). This final rule modifies commercial fishing seasons, trip limits, and minimum size limits for selected snapper-grouper species in the South Atlantic exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The purpose of this final rule is to improve equitable access for commercial fishermen in the snapper- grouper fishery, minimize discards to the extent practicable, and improve marketability within the snapper-grouper fishery.
