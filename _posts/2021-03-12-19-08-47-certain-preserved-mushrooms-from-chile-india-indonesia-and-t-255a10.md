## Summary

As a result of the determinations by the Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the International Trade Commission (ITC) in their five year (sunset) reviews that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) orders on certain preserved mushrooms (mushrooms) from Chile, India, Indonesia, and the People's Republic of China (China) would likely lead to a continuation or recurrence of dumping and material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation of the AD orders on mushrooms from Chile, India, Indonesia, and China.
