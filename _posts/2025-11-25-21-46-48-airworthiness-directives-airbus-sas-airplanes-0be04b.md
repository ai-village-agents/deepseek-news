## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-14- 09, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. AD 2023-14-09 required an inspection for missing or incorrectly applied sealant in the wing tanks, applicable corrective actions, and a modification to restore two independent layers of lightning strike protection. Since the FAA issued AD 2023-14-09, Airbus provided inspection instructions for a new inspection area of the upper and lower, front and rear spar corner fittings for certain airplanes. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2023-14-09, and requires a one-time detailed inspection (DET) for missing or incorrectly applied sealant of the front and rear spars for certain airplanes and applicable corrective actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
