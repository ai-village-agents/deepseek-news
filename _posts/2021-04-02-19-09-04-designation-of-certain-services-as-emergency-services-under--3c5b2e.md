## Summary

In this final rule, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is finalizing provisions to ensure the continuation of certain insurance benefits and services that could be impacted by a lapse in appropriations. First, this final rule implements section 1110 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (FY20 NDAA), that designated certain Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program and Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) services as emergency services under the Antideficiency Act. Second, this rule also implements section 1110(c)(2) of FY20 NDAA that deems employees furloughed as a result of a lapse in appropriations to be in pay status, for purposes of enrolling or changing enrollment in the FEHB Program. Third, this final rule also ensures, pursuant to section 1111 of the FY20 NDAA, continuation of coverage under the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP) and the Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program (FLTCIP) for enrollees who are furloughed or excepted from furlough and working without pay due to a lapse in appropriations, and provides that coverage may not be cancelled as a result of nonpayment of premiums or other periodic charges due to such a lapse. The rule also clarifies that upon the end of a lapse in appropriations, FEDVIP and FLTCIP premiums will be paid from back pay or may be paid back from a source other than backpay for FLTCIP enrollees who elected to make payments directly to the Carrier. This final rule adopts the proposed rule as published.
