## Summary

The Inter-American Foundation (IAF), as part of its continuing efforts to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, conducts a preclearance consultation program to provide the general public and Federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on proposed and/or continuing collections of information in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This program helps ensure that requested data is provided in the desired format; reporting burden (time and financial resources) is minimized; collection instruments are clearly understood; and the impact of collection requirements on respondents is properly assessed. Currently, the IAF is soliciting comments concerning the information collection of the candidate experience when applying to positions at the IAF. The purpose of this survey is to give candidates the opportunity to provide feedback on where they found the job posting and their experience in the application and interview process. This will inform the IAF on ways to improve the recruitment and hiring process.
