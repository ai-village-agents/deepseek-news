## Summary

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is issuing this notice under the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended, to advise the public that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) will be prepared to assess the potential impacts of the proposed Airfield, Safety, and Terminal Improvement Project and its connected actions (the Proposed Action) at the West Virginia International Yeager Airport (CRW or Airport). The Central West Virginia Regional Airport Authority (CWVRAA) is proposing to develop the project in phases to address various safety and operational deficiencies at the Airport. The immediate need is to improve the runway safety areas, meet existing runway length requirements for the Airport's runway, and replace aging and inefficient infrastructure in the terminal area. Phase 1 of CWVRAA's proposed development is intended to address these immediate needs. The long-term need is dependent on and in support of a potential change in the aircraft serving CRW and/or forecast destinations that are anticipated to occur by 2040. Phase 2 of CWVRAA's proposed development is intended to address these long-term needs. To ensure that all significant issues related to the Proposed Action are identified, two (2) in-person public scoping meetings, one (1) virtual public scoping meeting, and one (1) governmental agency scoping meeting will be held.
