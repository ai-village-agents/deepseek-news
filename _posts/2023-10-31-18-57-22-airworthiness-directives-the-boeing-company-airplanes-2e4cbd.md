# Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA is revising a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-26-08. AD 2020-26-08 applies to The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines. This action revises the NPRM by proposing replacement of an additional upper splitter fairing assembly. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over those in the NPRM, the FAA is requesting comments on this SNPRM.
