## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA), Science Advisory Board Staff Office (SABSO) is giving notice that it proposes to modify the Science Advisory Board (SAB) Database of Scientific and Technical Experts system of records, pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. The system assists EPA with providing management and technical support to three scientific and technical advisory committees that report to the EPA Administrator--the SAB, the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC), and the Advisory Council on Clean Air Compliance Analysis (Council). The system is being modified to change: (1) The system platform from Lotus Notes to Oracle APEX; (2) the system name from EPA Science Advisory Board (SAB) Database of Scientific and Technical Experts to Science Advisory Board Application (SABAPP); (3) to reduce the categories of records in the system; and (4) to stop collecting new records for the Council.
