# Airworthiness Directives; Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG Engines

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Model BR700-715A1-30, BR700-715B1-30, and BR700-715C1-30 engines. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of malformed scallop edge geometry and surface conditions at the front flange scallops of affected low-pressure compressor (LPC) booster rotors. This proposed AD would require repetitive fluorescent penetrant inspections (FPIs) of the front flange scallops of the LPC booster rotor for any cracks, replacement or repair of the LPC booster rotor if necessary and, as an optional terminating action to the repetitive FPIs, a visual inspection for malformed scallop edge geometry and malformed surface conditions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
