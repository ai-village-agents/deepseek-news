## Summary

NMFS is closing the directed fishery for Management Area 3. This closure is required because NMFS projects 98 percent of the catch allotted to Management Area 3 has been caught. This action is intended to prevent or limit the overharvest of Atlantic herring in Management Area 3, which would result in additional quota reductions next year.
