## Summary

EIA invites public comment on the proposed three-year extension, with changes, to the Electric Power & Renewable Electricity Surveys (EPRES) as required under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. EPRES consists of nine surveys, including annual, monthly and one daily survey. These surveys collect data from entities involved in the production, transmission, delivery, and sale of electricity, and in maintaining the reliable operation of the power system. The data collected are the primary source of information on the nation's electric power system. The renewable energy survey collects information on the manufacture, shipment, import, and export of photovoltaic cells and modules, and is the primary national source of information on these topics.
