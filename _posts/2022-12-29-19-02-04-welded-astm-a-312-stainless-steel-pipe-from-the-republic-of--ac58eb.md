## Summary

As a result of the determinations by the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) orders on welded ASTM A-312 stainless steel pipe (WSSP) from the Republic of Korea (Korea) and Taiwan would likely lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping, and material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation of these AD orders.
