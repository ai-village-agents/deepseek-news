## Summary

The Department of Commerce is amending the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by adding 43 entities under 50 entries to the Entity List.

These entries are listed on the Entity List under the destinations of China (31), Kenya (1), Laos (1), Malaysia (1), Pakistan (4), Singapore (1), South Africa (3), Thailand (1), the United Arab Emirates (5), and the United Kingdom (2). This rule also removes one entity from the Entity List under the destination of Latvia.
