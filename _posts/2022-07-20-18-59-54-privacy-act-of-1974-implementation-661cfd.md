## Summary

The Office of the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Privacy, Civil Liberties, and Transparency (OATSD(PCLT)) is giving concurrent notice of a new component-wide system of records pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974 for the CIG-30, Data Analytics Platform system of records and this proposed rulemaking. In this rulemaking, the Department proposes to exempt portions of this system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act because of national security and law enforcement requirements and to avoid interference during the conduct of criminal, civil, or administrative actions or investigations.
