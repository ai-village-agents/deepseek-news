## Summary

MARAD invites public comments on its intention to request Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The proposed collection OMB 2133-0529 (Application for Waiver of the Coastwise Trade Laws for Small Passenger Vessels) is used to identify the effect of potential foreign-built small passenger vessel coastwise operations on U.S. vessel builders and coastwise trade businesses. Since the last renewal there was an increase in the total respondents, responses, burden hours and cost to respondents. MARAD is required to publish this notice in the Federal Register to obtain comments from the public and affected agencies.
