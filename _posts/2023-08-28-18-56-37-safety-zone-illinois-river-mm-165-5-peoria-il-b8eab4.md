## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for all navigable waters within a half mile radius of a crane boom located in the Illinois River at Mile Marker (MM) 165.5. The safety zone is needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from all potential hazards associated with a crane boom blocking the navigable channel and the salvage operation for its removal. Entry of vessels or persons into this zone is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port Sector Upper Mississippi River (COTP) or a designated representative.
