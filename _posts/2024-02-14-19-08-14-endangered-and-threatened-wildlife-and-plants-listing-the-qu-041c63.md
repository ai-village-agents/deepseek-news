## Summary

We, NMFS, are listing the queen conch (Aliger gigas, formerly known as Strombus gigas) as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). We have completed a review of the status of queen conch, including efforts being made to protect the species, and considered public comments submitted on the proposed listing rule as well as new information received since the publication of the proposed rule. Based on all of this information, we have determined that the queen conch is not currently in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range, but is likely to become so within the foreseeable future. Thus, we are listing the queen conch as a threatened species under the ESA. At this time, we conclude that critical habitat is not yet determinable because data sufficient to perform the required analysis are lacking; any critical habitat designation would be proposed in a separate, future rulemaking.
