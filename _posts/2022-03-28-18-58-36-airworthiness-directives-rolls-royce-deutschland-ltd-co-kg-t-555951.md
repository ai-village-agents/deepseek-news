## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-15-01, which applies to all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Trent XWB-75, Trent XWB-79, Trent XWB-79B, Trent XWB-84, and Trent XWB-97 model turbofan engines. AD 2021-15-01 requires revisions to the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the Rolls-Royce (RR) Trent XWB time limits manual (TLM) and the operator's existing approved aircraft maintenance program (AMP). Since the FAA issued AD 2021-15-01, the manufacturer has revised the TLM life limits and updated mandatory inspection intervals of certain critical rotating parts. This proposed AD would require revisions to the ALS of the RR Trent XWB TLM and the operator's existing approved AMP, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
