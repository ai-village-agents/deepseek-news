## Summary

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) intends to prepare an environmental assessment (EA) or environmental impact statement (EIS) to address the potential environmental impacts associated with the proposed installation and operation of six new aeroderivative combustion turbine (CT) units at the Allen Combustion Turbine (ACT) site, located in Shelby County, Tennessee, southwest of the City of Memphis. The new aeroderivative units would generate approximately 200 Megawatts (MW) of power to help meet the growing system demand. The units would provide flexible and dispatchable transmission grid support and facilitate the integration of renewable generation onto the TVA bulk transmission system, consistent with TVA's 2019 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP). TVA is inviting public comment concerning the scope of the review, alternatives being considered, and environmental issues that should be addressed.
