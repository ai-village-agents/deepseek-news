## Summary

In accordance with the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA or the Act), notice is given of a proposed consent decree in Center for Biological Diversity v. Regan, No. 3:20-cv-06020-WHA (N.D. Cal.). On August 27, 2020, Plaintiffs Center for Biological Diversity and Center for Environmental Health (collectively, Plaintiffs) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division. On January 22, 2021, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. Plaintiffs alleged that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) failed to perform certain non- discretionary duties in accordance with the Act to timely respond to numerous state implementation plan (SIP) and control techniques guideline (CTG) submissions from the State of California and State of Colorado and to timely issue a federal implementation plan (FIP) to address specific CAA requirements for one particular area within California. The proposed consent decree would establish deadlines for EPA to act on certain submissions or, as an alternative for one area in California, to issue a FIP.
