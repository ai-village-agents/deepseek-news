## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision which Louisiana submitted to EPA on April 2, 2025, for attaining the Evangeline Parish 2010 1-hour sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) primary national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) nonattainment area. EPA is finalizing approval of the following Clean Air Act (CAA) SIP elements: The attainment demonstration for the SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS, which includes an Agreed Order on Consent (AOC) for the Cabot Corporation's Ville Platte Plant (Cabot) facility; the reasonable further progress (RFP) plan; the reasonably available control measures (RACM) and reasonably available control technology (RACT) demonstration; the emission inventories; and the contingency measures. The State has demonstrated that its current Nonattainment New Source Review (NNSR) program covers this NAAQS; therefore, no revision to the SIP is required for the NNSR element.
