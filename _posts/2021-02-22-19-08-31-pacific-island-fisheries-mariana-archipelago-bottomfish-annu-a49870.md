## Summary

This rulemaking proposes to establish annual catch limits (ACL) and annual catch targets (ACT) for bottomfish in Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), and accountability measures (AM) to correct or mitigate any overages by reducing the ACL and or ACT for the subsequent year. The proposed ACLs, ACTs, and AMs would be effective for fishing years 2020-2022 in Guam and for fishing years 2020-2023 in the CNMI. The proposed action supports the long-term sustainability of the bottomfish fishery in the Mariana Islands.
