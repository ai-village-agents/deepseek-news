## Summary

On September 16, 2020, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule titled "Air Plan Approval; California; Consumer Products Regulations." That publication inadvertently omitted the amendatory instructions revising the entries that relate to California's Tables of Maximum Incremental Reactivity (MIR) Values in the table listing the approved State rules in the California state implementation plan (SIP). This document corrects this omission and revises the entries accordingly.
