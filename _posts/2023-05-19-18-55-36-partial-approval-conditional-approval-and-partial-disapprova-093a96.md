## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving in part, conditionally approving in part, and disapproving in part a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Nevada pursuant to the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act") for the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of the 2015 national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for ozone. As part of this action, we are reclassifying a region of the State for emergency episode planning purposes with respect to ozone. Finally, we are approving a regulatory revision into the Nevada SIP.
