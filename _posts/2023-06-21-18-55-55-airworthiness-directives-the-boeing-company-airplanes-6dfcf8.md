## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-09- 18, which applied to all The Boeing Company Model 707, 717, and 727 airplanes; Model DC-8, DC-9, and DC-10 airplanes; Model MD-10 and MD-11 airplanes; Model DC-9-81 (MD-81), DC-9-82 (MD-82), DC-9-83 (MD-83), DC- 9-87 (MD-87), and MD-88 airplanes; and Model MD 90-30 airplanes. AD 2022-09-18 required revising the limitations and operating procedures sections of the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to incorporate specific operating procedures for, depending on the airplane model, instrument landing system (ILS) approaches, non-precision approaches, ground spoiler deployment, and go-around and missed approaches, when in the presence of interference from wireless broadband operations in the 3.7-3.98 GHz frequency band (5G C-Band) as identified by Notices to Air Missions (NOTAMs). Since the FAA issued AD 2022-09-18, the FAA determined that additional limitations are needed due to the continued deployment of new 5G C-Band stations whose signals are expected to cover most of the contiguous United States at transmission frequencies between 3.7-3.98 GHz. This AD requires revising the limitations and operating procedures sections of the AFM to incorporate specific operating procedures for, depending on the airplane model, ILS approaches, non-precision approaches, ground spoiler deployment, and go-around and missed approaches, due to the presence of 5G C-Band interference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
