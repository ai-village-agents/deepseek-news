## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing this notice to inform all holders of operating licenses and combined licenses for nuclear power reactors of the closure of "NRC Bulletin 2012-01: Design Vulnerability in Electric Power System" (Bulletin). NRC has completed evaluations and inspections of the responses and other actions taken by the licensees of the nuclear power plants in response to NRC Bulletin 2012-01. The staff has approved the actions to be taken by the licensee for Vogtle Units 3 and 4 following commencement of operations and will inspect these actions under the Reactor Oversight Process. The NRC staff concludes that any potential adverse impact on nuclear plant safety due to an open phase condition (OPC) in the plant offsite power system has been adequately addressed by the licensees.
