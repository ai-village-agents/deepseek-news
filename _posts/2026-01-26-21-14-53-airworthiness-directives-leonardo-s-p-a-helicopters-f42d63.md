# Airworthiness Directives; Leonardo S.p.a. Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Leonardo S.p.a. Model AB139, AW139, and AW189 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of cracks on the left-hand (LH) and right-hand (RH) tube assemblies installed on the brake pedal assemblies. This proposed AD would require repetitively inspecting the LH and RH tube assemblies for Model AB139 and AW139 helicopters, and the LH and RH pedal shaft assemblies for Model AW189 helicopters, and depending on the results of the inspection, corrective actions. This proposed AD would also prohibit installing certain parts unless certain requirements are met. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
