## Summary

The U.S. Department of State (Department of State) is publishing an interim final rule with request for comment (interim final rule) for Exchange Visitor Program regulations, the regulations that apply to sponsors the Department of State designates to conduct international educational and cultural exchange programs. The Department of State is making administrative changes to the regulations to include providing sponsors two new options: using digital signature software to sign Certificates of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor (J-1) Status (Forms DS-2019) and electronically transmitting Forms DS-2019. Sponsors should experience cost savings and increased efficiencies from these changes.
