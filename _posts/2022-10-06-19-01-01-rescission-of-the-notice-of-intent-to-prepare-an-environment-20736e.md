## Summary

The FHWA, in cooperation with the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) is issuing this Notice to advise the public that we are rescinding the June 3, 1996, Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Route 2/2A/32 Project in New London County, Connecticut. We are rescinding the NOI because a substantial amount of time has passed since its publication and there is a need to re-evaluate traffic growth and congestion in the region.
