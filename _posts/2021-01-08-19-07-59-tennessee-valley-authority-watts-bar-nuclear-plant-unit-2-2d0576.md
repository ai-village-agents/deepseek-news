## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. NPF-96, issued to Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), for operation of the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant (Watts Bar or WBN), Unit 2. The proposed amendment would revise the Watts Bar Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) to apply alternate eddy current probabilities of detection (POD) to indications of axial outer diameter stress corrosion cracking (ODSCC) at tube support plates (TSPs) in the Watts Bar, Unit 2, steam generators for the beginning-of-cycle (BOC) voltage distribution in support of the Watts Bar, Unit 2, operational assessment. The proposed POD values will only be used until the Watts Bar, Unit 2, steam generators are replaced. For this amendment request, the NRC proposes to determine that it involves no significant hazards consideration. Because this amendment request contains sensitive unclassified non- safeguards information (SUNSI), an order imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI for contention preparation.
