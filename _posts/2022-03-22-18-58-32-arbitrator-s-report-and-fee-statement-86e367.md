## Summary

The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS), invites the general public and other Federal Agencies to take this opportunity to comment on the following information collection request, Arbitrator's Report and Fee Statement, (Agency Form R-19). This information collection request was previously approved by the Office of Management Budget (OMB) but has expired. FMCS is requesting a reinstatement without change. The Arbitrator's Report and Fee Statement, (Agency Form R-19), allows FMCS to comply with its statutory obligation pursuant to the statute, 29 U.S.C. 171(b), to make governmental facilities available for voluntary arbitration. To carry out this policy, FMCS have issued regulations, 29 CFR part 1404, which provide for the operation and maintenance of a roster of professional arbitrators. The Agency Form R-19, which arbitrators file with the Agency following each decision rendered, allows FMCS to monitor the work of the arbitrator and to collect arbitration information, such as median arbitrator fees and days spent on each case, for the Agency's annual report.
