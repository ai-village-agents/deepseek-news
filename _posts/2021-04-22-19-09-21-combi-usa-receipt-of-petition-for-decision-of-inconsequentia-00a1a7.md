## Summary

Combi USA (Combi), has determined that certain Combi USA BabyRide rear-facing child restraint systems manufactured between March 1, 2016, and September 2, 2019, do not fully comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 213, Child Restraint Systems. Combi filed an original noncompliance report dated March 8, 2021, and later amended it on March 10, 2021, and March 11, 2021. Subsequently, Combi petitioned NHTSA on March 30, 2021, for a decision that the subject noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. This notice announces receipt of Combi's petition.
