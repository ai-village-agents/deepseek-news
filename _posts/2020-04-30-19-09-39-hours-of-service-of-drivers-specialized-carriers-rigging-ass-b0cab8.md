## Summary

FMCSA announces that it has received an application from the Specialized Carriers & Rigging Association (SC&RA) for a renewal of its exemption from the minimum 30-minute rest break provision of the Agency's hours-of-service (HOS) regulations. The exemption covers drivers for all specialized carriers transporting loads that exceed normal weight and dimensional limits--oversize/overweight (OS/OW) loads--and require a permit issued by a government authority. SC&RA currently holds an exemption for the period from June 18, 2015, through June 17, 2020. FMCSA requests public comment on SC&RA's application for a renewal of its exemption.
