## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a safety zone that would restrict vessels from transiting through certain navigable waters in the San Juan Captain of the Port (COTP) zone during periods of experienced or expected gale force winds (of 34 knots/39 mph or greater) and reduced visibility due to anticipated heavy weather periods, e.g., tropical storm, hurricane or due to any natural or other disasters where the restriction of vessel traffic is deemed appropriate by the COTP. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit vessel traffic transiting or remaining in the regulated areas unless authorized by the COTP, San Juan, Puerto Rico, or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
