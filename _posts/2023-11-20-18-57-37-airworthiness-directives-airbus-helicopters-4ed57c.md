## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Airbus Helicopters Model SA-365C1, SA-365C2, and SA-365N helicopters. This AD was prompted by reports of damaged control rod dual bearings (dual bearings) that are installed on the tail rotor gearbox (TGB). This AD requires repetitively inspecting the TGB magnetic plug for particles, analyzing any particles collected, taking corrective actions if necessary, and reporting certain information. Finally, this AD allows an affected dual bearing to be installed on a helicopter if certain actions are accomplished, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
