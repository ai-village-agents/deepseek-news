## Summary

The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) is modifying a System of Records titled, "National Security Education Program-- Information Technology (NSEP-IT) System," DHRA 09. The modifications will update the System of Records Notice (SORN) to meet OMB Circular No. A-108 requirements, and specifically add new system components (National Security Education Program (NSEP) Network (NSEPnet), Student Certification System, and NSEP Grants Database), and expand the categories of records collected as required by a recent statutory change. The SORN enables the NSEP to provide the public with educational resources and provides the NSEP the ability to collect information necessary to select qualified candidates for scholarships and fellowships.
