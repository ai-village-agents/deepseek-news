## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-2B16 (604 Variant) airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that during certain modes, the flight guidance/autopilot does not account for engine failure while capturing an altitude. This AD requires revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to add new limitations and procedures. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
