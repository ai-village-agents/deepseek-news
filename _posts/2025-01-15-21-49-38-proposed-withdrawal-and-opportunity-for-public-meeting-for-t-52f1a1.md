## Summary

At the request of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Secretary of the Interior proposes to withdraw approximately 1,043.57 acres of public lands located in Clark County, Nevada, from location and entry under the United States mining laws and from leasing under the mineral and geothermal leasing laws, but not from the disposal of mineral materials under the mineral materials disposal laws, for 20 years, subject to valid existing rights. The purpose of the proposed withdrawal is to establish protection for a utility and transportation corridor to facilitate the orderly development of future infrastructure and public services while preventing conflicting land uses. Publication of this notice segregates these lands for up to 2 years from location and entry under the United States mining laws and from leasing under the mineral and geothermal leasing laws, but not from the disposal of mineral materials under the mineral materials disposal laws, subject to valid existing rights. This notice initiates a 90-day public comment period and announces an opportunity to request a public meeting.
