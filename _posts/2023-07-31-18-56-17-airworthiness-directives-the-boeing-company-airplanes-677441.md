## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 737-100, 737-200, 737-200C, 737-300, 737-400, 737-500, 737-600, 737-700, 737-700C, 737-800, 737-900, 737-900ER, 757- 200, 757-200PF, 757-200CB, 757-300, 767-200, 767-300, 767-300F, and 767-400ER series airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports indicating premature aging of certain passenger chemical oxygen generators. This AD requires repetitively replacing affected chemical oxygen generators with serviceable parts. This AD also limits the installation of affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
