## Summary

The U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces the opportunity to apply for an estimated $1.5 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2023 discretionary grants under the Airport Improvement Program (AIP). The FAA awards these annually appropriated discretionary funds through the FAA's long- standing iterative, competitive grant process. Prior to the publication of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the FAA identified eligible applicants in its National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS) and compiled potentially eligible projects through the 3-year Airports Capital Improvement Plan (ACIP). Both of these processes are described in FAA Order 5090.5, "Formulation of NPIAS and ACIP," which authorizes discretionary funds. The AIP funds airport capital improvements and rehabilitation projects. All discretionary grant funding is subject to appropriations, statutory requirements, and related program funding availability.
