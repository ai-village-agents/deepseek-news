## Summary

FMCSA proposes the implementation of the statutory exemption from its operating authority registration rules for providers of recreational activities. The exemption would apply to motor carriers operating a motor vehicle designed or used to transport between 9 and 15 passengers (including the driver), whether operated alone or with a trailer attached to the transport vehicle, if the motor vehicle is operated by a person that provides recreational activities within a 150 air-mile radius of the location at which passengers initially boarded the motor vehicle at the beginning of the trip. FMCSA also proposes to define recreational activities to clarify the scope of this exemption.
