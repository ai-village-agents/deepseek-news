## Summary

This action amends two existing low altitude RNAV routes (T- routes), and establishes nine new T-routes in support of the South- Central Florida Metroplex Project. The changes made in this rule will reduce the dependency of the National Airspace System (NAS) on ground- based navigational systems, and assist with the transition to a more efficient Performance Based Navigation (PBN) route structure.
