## Summary

The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) has submitted a request to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval of an extension of a currently approved information collection used to file complaints and disclosures with OSC (Form OSC-14/dynamic electronic form). In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, OSC is providing the public with an additional opportunity to comment on this proposed information collection prior to OMB approval. OMB first approved OSC's dynamic electronic filing form on September 18, 2017. OSC revised the previously approved form in July 2019 to reflect interim statutory changes and obtained emergency OMB/ OIRA processing for that collection. A final rule authorizing use of Form OSC-14 took effect on August 26, 2019, and OMB approval on February 3, 2020, authorized use of the revised form through March 2023. The collection was subsequently re-approved through February 28, 2026. OSC now seeks to extend approval of this collection through 2029. No substantive changes to the form or collection methodology are proposed with this extension.
