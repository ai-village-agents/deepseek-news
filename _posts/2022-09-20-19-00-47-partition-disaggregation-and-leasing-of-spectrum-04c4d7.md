## Summary

In this document, a Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Second FNPRM) seeks comment on whether potential future expansion of the Enhanced Competition Incentive Program (ECIP) for wireless services could further the Congressional goals set out in the Making Opportunities for Broadband Investment and Limiting Excessive and Needless Obstacles to Wireless Act (MOBILE NOW Act). It also proposes a framework for creating alternatives to population-based performance requirements for a variety of wireless radio service stakeholders with communications plans and business models not specifically targeted towards providing commercial wireless service to subscribers. It seeks specific comment on these proposals and a variety of alternatives to develop a robust record on the most efficient approach towards addressing this industry goal. The Second FNPRM also seeks comment on how the proposals in the Second FNPRM may promote or inhibit advances in diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, as well the scope of the Commission's relevant legal authority.
