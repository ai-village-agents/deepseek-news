## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) eliminates unnecessary cable rate regulation forms and rules; deregulates cable equipment not used exclusively to receive the basic cable service tier; deregulates small cable systems serving 15,000 or fewer subscribers that are owned by small cable companies serving 400,000 or fewer subscribers; declines to extend rate regulation to commercial establishments; and modifies rules to account for the sunset of CPST regulation and clarifies their application. This action is necessary because many of the FCC's rules governing cable rate regulation have been rendered obsolete or unworkable due to the sunset of cable programming service tier (CPST) rate regulation and the passage of time. In addition, in this document, the FCC closes several moot proceedings and dockets which are either resolved by this document or have become obsolete or irrelevant due to regulatory updates, technology advances, marketplace changes, or have been addressed in other FCC orders. The actions taken in this document by the FCC will have the effect of streamlining the cable television rate regulations, unleashing prosperity through deregulation, and reducing the administrative burdens on the cable industry, franchising authorities, and the FCC, while continuing to fulfill the statutory obligation to subscribers to ensure reasonable rates for cable service and equipment.
