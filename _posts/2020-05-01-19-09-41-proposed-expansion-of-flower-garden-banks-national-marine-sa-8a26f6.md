## Summary

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) proposes to expand the boundaries of Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (FGBNMS) and revise the sanctuary's terms of designation. The purpose of this action is to expand the sanctuary to include portions of 14 additional reefs and banks in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, representing a 104 square mile increase in area. The existing FGBNMS regulations would be applied to the expanded locations. NOAA is soliciting public comment on the proposed rule.
