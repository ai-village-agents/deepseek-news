## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is issuing a final rule to classify spinal spheres for use in intervertebral fusion procedures (an unclassified, preamendments device) into class III for which FDA is separately requiring the filing of a premarket approval application (PMA). FDA has determined that general controls and special controls together are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for this device.
