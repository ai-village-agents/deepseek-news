## Summary

On December 10, 2021, Rural Development's Rural Business- Cooperative Service, Rural Housing Service, and Rural Utilities Service (referred to as "the Agency" or "Agency") published a final rule with comment for the OneRD Guaranteed Loan regulation (OneRD). The final rule made necessary revisions to the policy and procedures that strengthened the oversight and management of the growing Community Facilities, Water and Waste Disposal, Business and Industry, and Rural Energy for America guarantee portfolios. Following final implementation of the rule, the Agency found that a correction due to an omission is necessary. This technical correction makes an amendment to fix a paragraph reference.
