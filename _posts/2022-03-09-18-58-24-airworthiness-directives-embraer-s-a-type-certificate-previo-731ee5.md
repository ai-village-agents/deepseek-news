## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-12-08 for all Embraer S.A. Model EMB-505 airplanes. AD 2020-12-08 required inspections of the mass-balance weights of the elevators, ailerons, and rudder (flight control surfaces) and their attachment parts, and corrective actions if necessary, and revising the airworthiness limitation section (ALS) of the maintenance manual or instructions for continued airworthiness to incorporate new airworthiness limitations. This AD retains the actions required by AD 2020-12-08 and requires, for certain airplanes, cleaning and weighing certain mass-balances and installation or replacement, as applicable; and for certain other mass- balances for certain airplanes, replacement of those mass-balances. This AD was prompted by a determination that new applicable airplane serial numbers and new criteria for the replacement of affected parts are necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
