## Summary

The FAA proposes to remove Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020- 25-03, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A318, A319, A320, and A321 series airplanes. AD 2020-25-03 requires repetitive checks of the pressure gauges on the inflation reservoir of each emergency escape slide/raft to determine the amount of pressure, and applicable corrective actions. AD 2020-25-03 also provides optional terminating action for the repetitive checks. AD 2020-25-03 is no longer necessary because the unsafe condition no longer exists. Accordingly, the FAA proposes to remove AD 2020-25-03.
