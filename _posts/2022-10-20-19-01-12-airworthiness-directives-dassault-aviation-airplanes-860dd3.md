## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-09-15, which applies to all Dassault Aviation Model FALCON 2000 and FALCON 2000EX airplanes. AD 2022-09-15 requires relocating affected servo-valves and revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to provide temporary information necessary to operate airplanes fitted with at least one affected brake servo-valve. This AD was prompted by a determination that replacing certain brake servo-valves is necessary to address the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2022-09-15 and would require replacing an affected part with a serviceable part, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). This proposed AD would also limit or prohibit the installation of affected brake servo-valves. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
