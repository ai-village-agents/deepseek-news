## Summary

The Las Vegas Field Office announces the temporary closure of certain public lands under its administration. The off-highway vehicle (OHV) race area in the Jean/Roach Dry Lakes Special Recreation Management Area is used by OHV recreationists, and the temporary closure is needed to limit their access to the race area and to minimize the risk of collisions with spectators and racers during the 2023 Southern Nevada Off Road Enthusiasts (SNORE) 250 and Mint 400 OHV Races.
