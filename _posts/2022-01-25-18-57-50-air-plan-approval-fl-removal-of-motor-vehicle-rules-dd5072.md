## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving changes to a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Florida, through the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), in a letter dated July 2, 2020. Specifically, EPA is approving the removal of rules prohibiting tampering with motor vehicle air pollution control equipment and rules concerning visible emissions from motor vehicles. These rules were previously approved into the SIP even though they were not required by the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) to be in the SIP. EPA is approving the removal of the tampering rules and visible emission rules from the federally approved SIP because removing the requirements is consistent with the CAA and applicable regulations.
