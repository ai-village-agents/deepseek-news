## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("Commission" or "CFTC") is announcing an opportunity for public comment on the proposed renewal of a collection of certain information by the agency. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act ("PRA"), Federal agencies are required to publish notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed extension of a collection of information and to allow 60 days for public comment. This notice solicits comments on the information collections associated with the process for a designated contract market ("DCM") or a swap execution facility ("SEF") to make a swap available to trade and therefore subject to the trade execution requirement pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act ("CEA"). This process imposes rule filing requirements on a DCM or a SEF that wishes to submit a swap as available to trade.
