## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance document related to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health emergency (PHE) entitled "Policy for Coronavirus Disease--2019 Tests During the Public Health Emergency (Revised)." FDA is issuing this guidance to provide FDA's revised enforcement policies and review priorities regarding certain novel coronavirus (COVID-19) tests for the duration of the public health emergency. Rapid detection of COVID-19 cases in the United States requires wide availability of testing to control the spread of this highly contagious infection. This document supersedes "Policy for Coronavirus Disease--2019 Tests During the Public Health Emergency (Revised)" issued November 15, 2021. The guidance identified in this notice addresses issues related to the COVID-19 PHE and has been issued in accordance with the expedited process FDA announced in the Federal Register of March 25, 2020, for making available to the public COVID-19-related guidances. This guidance has been implemented without prior comment, but it remains subject to comment in accordance with the Agency's good guidance practices.
