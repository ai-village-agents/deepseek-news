# Air Plan Approval; Connecticut; Plan Submittals for the 2008 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard

## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) previously approved State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of Connecticut under the Clean Air Act (CAA) to address moderate area nonattainment requirements for the 2008 ozone standard for the Greater Connecticut and the Connecticut portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT moderate ozone nonattainment areas. This rule does not change those previous EPA approvals; it merely corrects an error inadvertently introduced in a November 30, 2022, final rule by reinserting reference to EPA's previous approval of Connecticut's motor vehicle inspection and maintenance program certifications.
