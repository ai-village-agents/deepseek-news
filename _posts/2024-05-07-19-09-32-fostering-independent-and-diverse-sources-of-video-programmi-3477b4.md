## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) seeks comment on the current state of the marketplace for diverse and independent programming and on the obstacles faced by independent programmers seeking carriage on multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs) and online platforms. In order to alleviate such obstacles, the Commission proposes to prohibit two types of contractual provisions in program carriage agreements between independent programmers and MVPDs: most favored nation (MFN) provisions, and unreasonable alternative distribution method (ADM) provisions. The Commission also seeks comment on current program bundling practices.
