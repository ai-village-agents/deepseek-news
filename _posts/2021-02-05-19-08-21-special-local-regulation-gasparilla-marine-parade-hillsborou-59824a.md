## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary special local regulation for the 2021 Gasparilla Marine Parade on the waters of Hillsborough Bay in the vicinity of Tampa, Florida. This event is expected to attract over 600 spectator craft along the parade route, with approximately 18 vessels participating in the official flotilla. This regulation is necessary to ensure the safety of public, the official flotilla, and spectator vessels before, during, and after the parade. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
