## Summary

This action proposes to amend Class D airspace, Class E surface airspace, and Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface for Worcester Regional Airport, Worcester, MA, as an airspace evaluation of the area determined additional airspace is necessary. Also, this action proposes to establish Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface for UMass Memorial Medical Center-University Campus Heliport, to accommodate new area navigation (RNAV) global positioning system (GPS) standard instrument approach procedures (SIAPs) serving this heliport. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.
