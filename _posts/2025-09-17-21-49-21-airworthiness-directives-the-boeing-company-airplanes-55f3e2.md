## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report indicating that the oxygen supply tubing can become kinked when certain passenger service unit (PSU) oxygen panel assemblies are installed in the forward-most position of a center stow bin. This AD requires a one-time inspection of the affected PSU oxygen panel assemblies and applicable on-condition actions. This AD also prohibits the installation of affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
