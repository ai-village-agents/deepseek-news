## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled National HIV Surveillance System (NHSS). The NHSS collects comprehensive population-based data on persons living with HIV in the U.S. and its territories, utilizing standard reporting from laboratories and healthcare providers to monitor trends, estimate incidence and prevalence, analyze drug resistance, detect and monitor clusters, and inform public health planning and resource allocation at federal, state and local levels and by HIV prevention and care partners.
