## Summary

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) invites public comment on one currently approved Information Collection Request (ICR), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number 1652-0071, that we will submit to OMB for an extension in compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected burden. This collection involves the submission of information from certain current and former TSA employees who are interested in obtaining a Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2004 (LEOSA) Identification (ID) Card, a retired badge, and/or a retired credential.
