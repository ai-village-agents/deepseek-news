## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Leonardo S.p.a. Model A109S and AW109SP helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a protective sheath, installed around a fixed flight control rod, which should have been removed during assembly. This proposed AD would require borescope inspecting certain parts, and removing any foreign object if detected, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
