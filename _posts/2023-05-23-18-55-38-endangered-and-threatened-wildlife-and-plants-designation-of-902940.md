## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), designate critical habitat for the Miami tiger beetle (Cicindelidia floridana) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. In total, approximately 1,869 acres (756 hectares) in Miami-Dade County, Florida, fall within the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. This rule extends the Act's protections to the Miami tiger beetle's critical habitat.
