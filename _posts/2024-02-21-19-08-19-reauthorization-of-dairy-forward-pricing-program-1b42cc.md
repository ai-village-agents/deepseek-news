## Summary

This final rule reauthorizes the Dairy Forward Pricing Program (DFPP) in accordance with the Further Continuing Appropriations and Other Extensions Act, 2024 (Extension Act), and makes two administrative changes to the provisions to include the California Federal milk marketing order in the list of eligible orders where use of a forward contract is applicable. Establishing new contracts under the DFPP was prohibited between the expiration of the program on September 30, 2023, and passage of the Extension Act on November 16, 2023. The Extension Act reauthorizes the DFPP program to allow handlers to enter into new contracts until September 30, 2024. Any forward contract entered prior to the September 30, 2024, deadline must expire by September 30, 2027.
