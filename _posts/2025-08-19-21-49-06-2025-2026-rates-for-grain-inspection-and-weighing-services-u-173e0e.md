## Summary

The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS or the Agency) is announcing the 2025/2026 rates it will charge for official grain inspection and weighing services, supervision of official grain inspection and weighing services, and miscellaneous fees for other services performed under the United States Grain Standards Act (USGSA), as amended. This action publishes the resulting fees from the annual review of fees. The 2025/2026 hourly, unit, and tonnage rates will be applied at the beginning of the fiscal year. This action establishes the rates for user-funded services based on costs incurred by AMS. This year, cost-based analyses indicated the need to increase certain user fee rates when current rates are insufficient to cover the costs of providing the service. While cost-saving measures have and will continue to be implemented, user fee rate increases are necessary to offset rising operational costs and rebuild the user fee reserve. Prospective customers can find the fee schedule posted on the Agency's public website: https://www.ams.usda.gov/about-ams/fgis-program- directives.
