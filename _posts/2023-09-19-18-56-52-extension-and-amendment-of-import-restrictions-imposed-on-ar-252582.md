## Summary

This document amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regulations to reflect an extension of import restrictions on certain archaeological and ethnological material of Cambodia, the addition of certain categories of archaeological and ethnological material of Cambodia to the existing import restrictions, and the clarification of certain categories of archaeological material of Cambodia. The United States has entered into an agreement with Cambodia that supersedes the existing agreement and amends the import restrictions that became effective on September 19, 2018. The restrictions, originally imposed by Treasury Decision (T.D.) 99-88 and last extended by CBP Dec. 18-11 for an additional five-year period, will continue with these amendments through September 19, 2028. The Designated List of archaeological and ethnological material of Cambodia to which the restrictions apply is reproduced below, with the amendments described.
