## Summary

On September 5, 2023, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") published a notice of proposed rulemaking ("NOPR"), in which DOE proposed amended energy conservation standards for walk-in coolers and walk-in freezers ("September 2023 NOPR"). In this notification of data availability ("NODA"), DOE is updating portions of its analysis for walk-in coolers and walk-in freezers based on information DOE received in response to DOE's September 2023 NOPR. DOE requests comments, data, and information regarding the updated analysis.
