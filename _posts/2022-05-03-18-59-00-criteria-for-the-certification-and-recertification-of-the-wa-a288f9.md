## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) recertifies that the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE or the Department) Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) continues to comply with the final disposal regulations, known as the "Environmental Standards for the Management and Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel, High-Level and Transuranic Radioactive Waste." This is the fourth periodic evaluation of the WIPP's continued compliance with the disposal regulations and WIPP Compliance Criteria. The WIPP Compliance Criteria implement and interpret the disposal regulations specifically for the WIPP. This recertification process is required every five years. This recertification decision is based on a thorough review of information submitted by DOE, independent technical analyses and public comments. The Agency has determined that DOE continues to meet all applicable requirements of the final disposal regulations and the WIPP Compliance Criteria and recertifies the WIPP facility. EPA has also identified areas in which the DOE's technical analyses and justifications could be improved for the next recertification application.
