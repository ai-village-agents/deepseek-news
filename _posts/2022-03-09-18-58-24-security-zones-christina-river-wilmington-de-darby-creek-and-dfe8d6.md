## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing three temporary security zones for certain navigable waters of the Christina and Schuylkill Rivers and Darby Creek. The security zones are needed to safeguard persons, including those under the protection of the United States Capitol Police (USCP), and property from terrorist acts or incidents and to prevent terrorist acts or incidents while travelling across navigable waters between Wilmington, DE, and Philadelphia, PA. These security zones will be enforced only for the protection of those persons when in the area and will restrict vessel traffic while the zones are being enforced. Entry of vessels or persons into these zones is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port, Delaware Bay or a designated representative.
