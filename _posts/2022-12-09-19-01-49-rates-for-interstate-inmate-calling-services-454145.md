## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) amends its rules to: require inmate calling services providers to provide access to all relay services eligible for Telecommunications Relay Service (TRS) Fund support, as well as American Sign Language (ASL) point-to-point video communication, where broadband internet access service is available, in jurisdictions with an average daily population of 50 or more incarcerated persons; clarify and expand the scope of restrictions on inmate calling services providers assessing charges for TRS and ASL point-to-point video calls; expand the scope of inmate calling services providers' required Annual Reports; and facilitate registration for carceral use of TRS. The Commission also amends its rules to: prohibit inmate calling services providers from seizing or otherwise disposing of funds in inactive calling services accounts until at least 180 calendar days of continuous inactivity has passed; lower the caps on provider charges for single-call services and third-party financial transactions; and clarify the definitions of "Jail" and "Prison." These actions will improve communications access for incarcerated people with disabilities and lessen the financial burdens incarcerated people and their loved ones face when using calling services.
