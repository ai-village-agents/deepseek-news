## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve the July 20, 2021 revisions to the Texas State Implementation Plan (SIP) concerning Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) requirements covered by the 2016 Oil and Natural Gas Control Techniques Guidelines (CTG or CTGs) for Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) and the Houston-Galveston- Brazoria (HGB) nonattainment areas (NAAs) for the 2008 8-hour ozone National Air Quality Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The DFW area consists of Collin, Dallas, Denton, Ellis, Johnson, Kaufman, Parker, Rockwall, Tarrant, and Wise Counties. The HGB area consists of Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller Counties. These areas were both classified as Serious nonattainment for the 2008 ozone NAAQS on August 23, 2019. These revisions create new RACT rules for oil and gas production and natural gas processing in the DFW and HGB NAAs and make non-substantive changes to reflect the rule applicability for the types of equipment currently required to comply with existing rule requirements but that would be subject to the new requirements upon the compliance date.
