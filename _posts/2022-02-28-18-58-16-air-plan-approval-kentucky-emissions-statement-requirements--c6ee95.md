## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted to EPA by the Commonwealth of Kentucky through the Kentucky Division for Air Quality (KDAQ) on October 15, 2020. The proposed changes were submitted by KDAQ to address the emissions statement requirements for the 2015 8- hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for Kentucky counties in the Cincinnati, Ohio-Kentucky 2015 8-hour ozone NAAQS nonattainment area (Cincinnati, OH-KY Area), and for some of the Kentucky counties in the Louisville, Kentucky-Indiana 2015 8-hour ozone NAAQS nonattainment area (Louisville, KY-IN Area). Specifically, EPA is proposing to approve the emissions statement requirements for portions of Boone, Campbell, and Kenton Counties in the Cincinnati, OH-KY Area, and Bullitt and Oldham Counties in the Louisville, KY-IN Area. EPA will consider and take action, or has considered and taken action, on submissions addressing the emissions statement requirements for the remaining counties in these two nonattainment areas, including the Jefferson County, Kentucky portion of the Louisville, KY-IN Area, in separate rulemakings. EPA is proposing approval pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act).
