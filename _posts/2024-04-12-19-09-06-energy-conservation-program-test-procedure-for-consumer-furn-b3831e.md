## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is amending the test procedure for consumer furnace fans to: clarify the scope of applicability of the furnace fan test procedure; incorporate by reference the most recent versions of industry test methods; establish a test method for furnace fans incapable of operating at the required external static pressure; clarify testing of certain products, including furnace fans with modulating controls, certain two-stage furnaces that operate at reduced input only for a preset period of time, and dual-fuel furnaces; and make updates to improve test procedure repeatability and reproducibility.
