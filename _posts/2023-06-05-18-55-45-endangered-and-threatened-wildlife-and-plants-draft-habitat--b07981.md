## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce the availability of a draft habitat conservation plan (HCP) and draft low effect screening form and environmental action statement (draft screening form) for activities associated with an application for an incidental take permit (ITP) under the Endangered Species Act. The ITP would authorize take of the tidewater goby and western snowy plover incidental to activities associated with management of the Salinas River Lagoon in Monterey County, California. The applicant developed the draft HCP as part of their application for an ITP. The Service prepared a draft low-effect screening form and environmental action statement in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act to evaluate the potential effects to the natural and human environment resulting from issuing an ITP to the applicant. We invite the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies to comment on these documents.
