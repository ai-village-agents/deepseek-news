## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) expands several rules previously adopted for gateway providers to other categories of voice service providers and modifies or removes existing rules consistent with these changes. Specifically, the Commission requires all domestic voice service providers to respond to traceback requests from the Commission, civil and criminal law enforcement, and the industry traceback consortium within 24 hours of the receipt of the request. Second, it requires originating providers to block substantially similar traffic when the Commission notifies the provider of illegal traffic or risk the Commission requiring all providers immediately downstream to block all of that provider's traffic. This rule is consistent with the rule for gateway providers, and requires non-gateway intermediate or terminating providers that receive such a notice to promptly inform the Commission that it is not the originating or gateway provider for the identified traffic, identify the upstream provider(s) from which it received the traffic, and, if possible, take lawful step to mitigate the traffic. Third it requires all voice service providers to take reasonable and effective steps to ensure that the immediate upstream provider is not using it to carry or process a high volume of illegal traffic. Finally, it updates the Commission's Robocall Mitigation Database certification requirements to reflect the 24-hour traceback requirement.
