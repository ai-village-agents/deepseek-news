## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, are initiating 5-year status reviews under the Endangered Species Act, for 3 plant and 13 animal species. A 5-year status review is based on the best scientific and commercial data available at the time of the review; therefore, we are requesting submission of any such information that has become available since the last review for the species. We invite comments from the public and Federal, Tribal, State, and local governments.
