## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2025-01- 08, which applied to all The Boeing Company Model 747-200B, 747-200C, 747-200F, 747-300, 747-400, 747-400D, 747-400F, 747-8F, and 747-8 series airplanes. AD 2025-01-08 required identifying the part number, and the serial number if applicable, of the Captain's and First Officer's seats and applicable on-condition actions for affected seats. AD 2025-01-08 also required a one-time detailed inspection and repetitive checks of the horizontal movement system (HMS) of the Captain's and First Officer's seats and applicable on-condition actions. Since the FAA issued AD 2025-01-08, the FAA determined that AD 2025-01-08 contains an error when providing conditions for taking credit using a previous revision of the service information. This AD requires the actions of AD 2025-01-08 and revises paragraph (j) of this AD to clarify which actions are not required. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
