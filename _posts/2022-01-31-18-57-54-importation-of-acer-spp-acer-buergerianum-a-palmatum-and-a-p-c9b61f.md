## Summary

We are advising the public that we have prepared a pest risk analysis relative to the importation of three Acer spp. (Acer buergerianum, A. palmatum, and A. pseudosieboldianum) dwarf plants from the Republic of Korea into the continental United States. Currently, Acer spp. are included in our lists of taxa of plants for planting whose importation into the United States is not authorized pending pest risk analysis. Based on the findings of the pest risk analysis, we are proposing to remove Acer buergerianum, A. palmatum, and A. pseudosieboldianum dwarf plants from the Republic of Korea from the not authorized pending plant risk analysis lists, thereby allowing the importation of such Acer spp. into the United States, subject to certain conditions. We are making the pest risk analysis available to the public for review and comment.
