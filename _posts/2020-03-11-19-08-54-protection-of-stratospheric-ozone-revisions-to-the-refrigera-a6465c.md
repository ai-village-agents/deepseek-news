## Summary

The Clean Air Act prohibits knowingly venting or releasing ozone-depleting and substitute refrigerants in the course of maintaining, servicing, repairing, or disposing of appliances or industrial process refrigeration. In 2016, the EPA amended the regulatory refrigerant management requirements and extended requirements that previously applied only to refrigerants containing an ozone-depleting substance to substitute refrigerants that are subject to the venting prohibition (i.e., those that have not been exempted from that prohibition) such as hydrofluorocarbons. Based on changes to the legal interpretation that supported that 2016 rule, this action revises some of those requirements--specifically, the appliance maintenance and leak repair provisions--so they apply only to equipment using refrigerant containing an ozone-depleting substance.
