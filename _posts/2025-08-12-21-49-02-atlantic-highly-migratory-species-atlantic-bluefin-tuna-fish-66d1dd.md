## Summary

NMFS closes the Angling category Gulf of Maine area fishery for large medium and giant ("trophy" (i.e., measuring 73 inches (185 centimeters (cm)) curved fork length (CFL) or greater)) Atlantic bluefin tuna (BFT) for the remainder of the 2025 fishing year. The Gulf of Maine area trophy fishery is defined as north of lat. 42[deg] N. This action applies to Atlantic Highly Migratory Species (HMS) Angling and HMS Charter/Headboat permitted vessels when fishing recreationally for BFT. In addition to this closure, NMFS, through a separate action, is simultaneously closing the Angling category fishery for school and large school/small medium (i.e., measuring 27 inches (68.5 cm) to less than 73 inches (185 cm) CFL) BFT. As a result of these closure actions, the Angling category fishery for BFT of all size classes is closed for the remainder of the year.
