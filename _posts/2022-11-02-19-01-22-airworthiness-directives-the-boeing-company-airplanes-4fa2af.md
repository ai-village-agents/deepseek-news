## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 757 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of cracks found in the fastener holes at a certain location in the center wing box rear spar, lower skin. This AD requires repetitive inspections for cracking of certain areas of the center wing box rear spar, lower skin and lower chord; and repair. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
