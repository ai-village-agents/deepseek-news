## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-01- 05, which applied to certain Airbus Helicopters Model EC130T2 helicopters. AD 2022-01-05 required repetitive visual inspections of the rivets on the rear transmission shaft bearing support, inspections of the local structure, and rivet heads on the left-hand and right-hand sides of the rear transmission shaft bearing support for cracking, missing, loose, or sheared rivets. AD 2022-01-05 also required reporting the results of those inspections and depending on the results, applicable corrective action. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-01- 05, Airbus Helicopters revised its service information to add procedures to improve visual inspections of the rivets on the rear transmission shaft bearing support. This AD was prompted by the determination that certain modified helicopters may have finishing paint applied to the gutter, which could prevent detection of cracks during inspections. This AD also extends the repetitive compliance time interval for certain inspections. This AD continues to require certain actions in AD 2022-01-05 and requires a one-time visual inspection for paint in the gutter area, and removal of paint if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
