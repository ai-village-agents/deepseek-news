## Summary

This action finalizes the FAA's policy on the FAA's procedures for processing land use changes on federally acquired or federally conveyed airport land or in situations where a land use change impacts the safe and efficient operation of aircraft or safety of people and property on the ground related to aircraft operations. These changes were needed because of legislative changes made in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018. The policy is intended to simplify the procedures required to make a land use change and to protect airport land by limiting the use of releases to the actual sale or disposal of airport property.
