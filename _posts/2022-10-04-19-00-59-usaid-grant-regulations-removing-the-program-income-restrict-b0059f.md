## Summary

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is issuing a final rule amending its grant regulations to remove a prohibition on for-profit entities from adding program income to a Federal award. This change allows any USAID assistance recipient-- whether nonprofit or for-profit--to add program income earned by the recipient to the Federal award. This will align USAID's approach to program income with other Federal agencies.
