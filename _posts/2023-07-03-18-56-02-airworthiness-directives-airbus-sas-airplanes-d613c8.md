## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2006-10- 13, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A330-223, -321, -322, and - 323 airplanes. AD 2006-10-13 required repetitive inspections of the firewall of the lower aft pylon fairing (LAPF), and corrective actions if necessary. AD 2006-10-13 also provided an optional terminating action for the repetitive inspections. This AD was prompted by the design of an updated LAPF, the installation of which constitutes terminating action for the repetitive inspection required by AD 2006- 10-13. This AD continues to require the actions specified in AD 2006- 10-13, provides new optional terminating actions, and changes the applicability to exclude certain airplanes; as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
