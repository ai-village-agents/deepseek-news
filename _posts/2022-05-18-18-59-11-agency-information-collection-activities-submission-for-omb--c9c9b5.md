## Summary

We have submitted a request to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval to use a new information collection. We are beginning a new recruitment program that connects veterans and Schedule A-eligible applicants with an opportunity for non-competitive employment. We propose to collect information from people who are interested in these opportunities in order to consider them for the positions and match them with possible jobs. The collection includes approval of a form, NARA Employment Interest Questionnaire, NA Form 3102. We invite you to comment on this proposed information collection.
