## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-18- 01, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A330-200 series airplanes, A330-200 Freighter series airplanes, A330-300 series airplanes, Model A330-800 series airplanes, and A330-900 series airplanes. AD 2022-18-01 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-18- 01, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
