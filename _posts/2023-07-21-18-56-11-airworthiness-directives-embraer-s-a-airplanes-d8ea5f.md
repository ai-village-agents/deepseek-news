## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Embraer S.A. (Embraer) Model EMB-505 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by an occurrence of corrosion on the clutch retaining bolt of the aileron autopilot servo mount. This proposed AD would require repetitively replacing the clutch retaining bolt and washer of the aileron autopilot servo mount, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
