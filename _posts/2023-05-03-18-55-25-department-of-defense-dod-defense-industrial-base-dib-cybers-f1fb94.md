## Summary

The DoD is proposing revisions to the eligibility criteria for the voluntary Defense Industrial Base (DIB) Cybersecurity (CS) Program. These revisions will allow a broader community of defense contractors to benefit from bilateral information sharing as when this proposed rule is finalized all defense contractors who are subject to mandatory cyber incident reporting will be able to participate. DoD is also proposing changes to definitions and some technical corrections for readability.
