## Summary

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency of the United States Department of Commerce, in support of efforts to develop and evaluate measurement methods and reference standards, including reference materials, to support measurement quality and comparability for the isotope metallomics measurement community, is establishing the Isotope Metallomics Quality Assurance Program (IMQAP) Consortium ("Consortium"). The Consortium will bring together stakeholders to identify and address measurement and standards needs related to isotopic measurements of clinical/biological materials and products. The Consortium efforts are intended to advance measurement capabilities, provide measurement quality assurance strategies, support the development of clinical/biological matrix reference materials, and collect data to support the development of best practices and standard methods. Participants will be required to sign a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA). At NIST's discretion, entities that are legally prohibited or not legally authorized to enter into a CRADA may be allowed to participate in the Consortium under an agreement other than a CRADA with terms that may differ, as necessary, from the CRADA terms.
