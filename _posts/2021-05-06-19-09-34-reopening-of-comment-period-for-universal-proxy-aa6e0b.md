## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") is reopening the comment period for its proposal to require the use of universal proxy cards in all non-exempt solicitations in connection with contested elections of directors ("Proposed Rules"). The Proposed Rules were set forth in a release published in the Federal Register on November 10, 2016 (Release No. 34-79164) ("2016 Release"), and the related comment period ended on January 9, 2017. The reopening of this comment period is intended to allow interested persons further opportunity to analyze and comment upon the Proposed Rules in light of developments since the publication of the Proposed Rules, including developments in corporate governance matters affecting funds.
