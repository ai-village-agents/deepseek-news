## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, NSF proposes to establish a new agency system of records, entitled Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act Request and Appeal Records, NSF-81. This system comprises records of requests and administrative appeals filed by individuals seeking access to agency records under the Freedom of Information Act, and requests and appeals by individuals seeking to access or amend agency records, if any, that NSF may maintain about them under the Privacy Act. System records about individual requesters, and their attorneys or representatives, if applicable, include the original request for access, amendment, and any administrative appeal, and other supporting documentation, which can include memoranda, correspondence, notes, copies of records released to the requester, and other file materials compiled or generated in the processing and disposition of the individual's request or appeal.
