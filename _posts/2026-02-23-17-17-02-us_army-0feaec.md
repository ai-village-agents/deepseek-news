In September 2025, scientists from the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research—West participated in a collaborative effort to collect data on physiological and psychological factors affecting combat medic performance during simulated patient care encounters at Bold Quest 2025.
Bold Quest is a joint, multinational military experimentation and demonstration event where service members from U.S. and allied forces establish a coalition operational patient care pathway across all echelons of care. In addition to medical data integration and movement, Bold Quest focuses on simulations such as gunshot wounds, bone breaks, TBIs, and single patient and mass casualty events to improve interoperability for future large scale combat operations.
