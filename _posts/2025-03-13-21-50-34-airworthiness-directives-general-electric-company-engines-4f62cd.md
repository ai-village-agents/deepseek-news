## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all General Electric Company (GE) Model CT7-2E1 engines. This AD was prompted by a revised analysis using an updated stress model, which calculated that the actual life limit of the CT7-2E1 stage 2 turbine aft cooling plate is less than the current life limit. This AD requires revision of the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the existing CT7-2E1 engine maintenance manual (EMM) and the operator's existing approved maintenance program or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate a reduced life limit for this part. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
