## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing its approval of the revised EPA Plan for the Federal Certification of Applicators of Restricted Use Pesticides within Indian Country (2023 EPA Plan). The 2023 EPA Plan is specific to the use of restricted use pesticides (RUPs) in Indian country. Because of limitations in Certification of Pesticide Applicators Rule (CPA Rule), RUPs may not be used legally in Indian country unless the Tribe has an EPA-approved certification plan, the Tribe has entered into an agreement with EPA, or EPA has issued a Federal certification plan for Indian country. The 2023 EPA Plan supersedes the 2014 EPA Plan and ensures applicators in Indian country have the competence needed to use RUPs. The amended plan is consistent with the existing regulatory requirements, including revisions made in 2017 to enhance and improve the competency of certified applicators of RUPs and persons working under their direct supervision. The 2017 regulatory revisions are intended to further reduce potential exposure of RUPs to certified applicators and those working under their direct supervision, other workers, the public, and the environment. Federal, State, Territory, and Tribal certifying authorities with existing certification plans were required to revise their existing plans to conform with the updated Federal standards for RUP applicator certification and receive EPA approval by the established regulatory deadline.
