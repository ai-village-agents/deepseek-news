## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is redesignating the Oakridge, Oregon nonattainment area to attainment for the 2006 24-hour fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). The EPA is also approving a maintenance plan for the area that demonstrates continued compliance with the PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS through the year 2035, which Oregon submitted along with the redesignation request for inclusion into the Oregon State Implementation Plan (SIP). Additionally, the EPA finds adequate and is approving the PM<INF>2.5</INF> motor vehicle emission budgets for the area. Finally, the EPA is approving additional control measures, because incorporation of these measures will strengthen the Oregon SIP and ensure PM<INF>2.5</INF> emissions reductions in the Oakridge area. The EPA is taking these actions pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act).
