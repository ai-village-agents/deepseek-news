## Summary

This notice announces proposed changes to the JRAP, which prescribe uniform rules of procedure for Courts of Criminal Appeals. Although these rules of practice and procedure fall within the Administrative Procedure Act's exemptions for notice and comment, the Department, as a matter of policy, has decided to make these changes available for public review and comment before they are implemented. The proposed changes are a refinement of the JRAP effective January 1, 2019 and implement statutory changes expanding the jurisdiction of Courts of Criminal Appeals and creating special trial counsel. The approval authorities for these changes are the Judge Advocates General of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard.
