## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Science Advisory Board (SAB) Staff Office requests public nominations of scientific experts to form a panel to review the new cloud-based Environmental Benefits and Mapping (BenMAP) tool, an open-source computer program that calculates estimated air pollution-related deaths and illnesses and their associated economic value. BenMAP is a shorthand title referring to the EPA's Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program, which has recently been updated to a new software platform built with Java code for the interface. The panel will review the latest available public release version of the BenMAP software.
