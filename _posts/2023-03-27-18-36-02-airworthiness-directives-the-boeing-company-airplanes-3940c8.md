## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 737-8, -8200, and -9 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report indicating that certain engine anti-ice (EAI) exhaust duct fasteners were inadequately torqued. This AD requires an inspection or records review to determine the serial number of each engine inlet; and if any affected engine inlet is found, an inspection of the EAI exhaust duct fasteners to determine the gap spacing and if all fasteners are installed, applicable related investigative and corrective actions, and part marking. This AD also limits the installation of affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
