## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE or the Department) is issuing this Notice to document emergency actions that it has taken pursuant to the Federal Power Act. DOE issued an emergency order to PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM) to operate certain power generating facilities under limited circumstances as described further below. PJM is the regional transmission operator for 65 million people in thirteen states and the District of Columbia (PJM Region). The PJM Region experienced a significant drop in temperatures and high winds due to a severe winter weather system. As a consequence of the impact of wind and decreasing temperatures, the demand for electricity in the PJM Region rose to an unusually high peak load. While the vast majority of generating units in the PJM Region continued to function adequately under these stressed conditions, some units experienced operating difficulties due to cold weather or fuel limitations, primarily gas. Because the additional generation required to serve the PJM Region was anticipated to result in a conflict with environmental standards and requirements, DOE authorized only the necessary additional generation for PJM to sufficiently supply the amount of energy needed to prevent electrical disruption.
