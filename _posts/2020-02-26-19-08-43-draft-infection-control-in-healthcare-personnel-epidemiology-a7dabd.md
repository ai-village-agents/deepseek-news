## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), announces the opening of a docket to obtain comment on the DRAFT Infection Control in Healthcare Personnel: Epidemiology and Control of Selected Infections Transmitted Among Healthcare Personnel and Patients: Diphtheria, Group A Streptococcus, Meningococcal Disease, and Pertussis Sections ("Draft Guideline"). The Draft Guideline updates four sections of the Guideline for infection control in health care personnel, 1998 ("1998 Guideline"), Part E: Epidemiology and Control of Selected Infections Transmitted Among Health Care Personnel and Patients, and their corresponding recommendations in Part II of the 1998 Guideline: "4. Diphtheria;" "9. Meningococcal Disease;" "12. Pertussis;" and "18. Streptococcus, group A infection." The updated recommendations in the Draft Guideline are intended for use by the leaders and staff of Occupational Health Services (OHS) to facilitate the provision of occupational infection prevention and control (IPC) services to healthcare personnel (HCP) for the management of exposed or infected HCP who may be contagious to others in the workplace.
