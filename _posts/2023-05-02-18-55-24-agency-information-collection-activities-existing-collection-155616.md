## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC or Commission) announces that it has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request for a three-year PRA approval of revisions to Component 1 of the Employer Information Report (EEO-1). This PRA submission for the EEO-1 Component 1 does not change the types of demographic workforce data historically collected by the EEO-1 (i.e., employee data by job category and sex and race or ethnicity). Rather, as part of this routine three-year clearance for Component 1 under the PRA, the EEOC seeks OMB approval of measures that streamline and modernize how the current EEO-1 Component 1 workforce demographic data are collected from employers.
