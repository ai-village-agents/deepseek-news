## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 79- 01-03, which applies to certain Piper Aircraft, Inc. (Piper) Model PA- 36-285 airplanes, and AD 83-20-03, which applies to Piper Models PA-36- 285, PA-36-300, and PA-36-375 airplanes. AD 79-01-03 requires repetitive inspections of the spar carry through assembly until it is replaced with a different part numbered spar carry through assembly. AD 83-20-03 establishes life limits for the wing spar structural components. Since the FAA issued AD 79-01-03 and AD 83-20-03, the FAA identified inspection and life limit requirements that were inadvertently omitted from those ADs. This proposed AD would retain the requirements in AD 79-01-03 and AD 83-20-03 and require the spar carry through assembly inspection from AD 79-01-03 for additional airplanes and add life limits for certain wing structural components previously omitted from AD 83-20-03 for certain serial numbered airplanes. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
