## Summary

In this document, the Commission seeks comment on the use of a terrain-based propagation model such as Longley-Rice for determining white space channel availability and seeks to develop a record on whether or not to implement such a model. In particular, the Commission seeks comment on the effect use of such a model would have on availability of channels for white space devices, how a terrain-based model such as Longley-Rice could be implemented within the current white space device framework, the technical parameters necessary to use such a model for identifying available spectrum while protecting incumbents from harmful interference, and various database and device implementation issues.
