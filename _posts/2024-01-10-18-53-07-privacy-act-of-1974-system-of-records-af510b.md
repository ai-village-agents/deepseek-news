## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC, Commission, or Agency) proposes to modify an existing system of records, FCC/OMD-23, Cadapult Space Management Center (CSMS), subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. This action is necessary to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act to publish in the Federal Register notice of the existence and character of records maintained by the agency. The Commission uses this system to allocate the offices, workstations, and facility workstations for FCC employees and contractors following the FCC/National Treasury Union (NTEU) space assignment policy. This modification makes various necessary changes and updates, including formatting changes required by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-108 since its previous publication, the addition of six new routine uses, as well as the revision of three existing routine uses.
