## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing Interim Staff Guidance (ISG) "Safety Review of Light-Water Power Reactor Construction Permit Applications" to clarify existing guidance and to assist the NRC staff in determining whether an application to construct a light-water power reactor (LWR) facility meets the minimum requirements to issue a construction permit (CP). The NRC anticipates the submission of power reactor CP applications in the next few years based on preapplication engagement initiated by several prospective applicants. This guidance is applicable to all applicants for a CP for a light-water power reactor but not to non-LWR applicants or those following the Advanced Reactor Content of Application Project (ARCAP) guidance to the extent the guidance is issued as final and is relevant to the application from a technical and regulatory perspective.
