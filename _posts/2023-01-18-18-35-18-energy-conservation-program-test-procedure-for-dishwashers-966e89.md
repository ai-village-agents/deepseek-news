## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is amending the current test procedures for dishwashers, adopting a new test procedure appendix, incorporating by reference Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers ("AHAM") standards--AHAM DW-1-2020 and DW-2-2020--and applying certain provisions of the industry standards to the test procedures appendices. The amendments to the current appendix establish requirements for water hardness, relative humidity, and loading pattern; update requirements for ambient temperature, detergent dosage, and standby power measurement; and include testing approaches from published dishwasher waivers. The new test procedure appendix additionally includes provisions for a minimum cleaning index threshold to validate the selected test cycle and updated annual number of cycles and low-power mode hours for the calculation of annual energy consumption.
