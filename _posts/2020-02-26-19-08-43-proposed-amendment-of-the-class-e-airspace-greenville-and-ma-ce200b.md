## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Muhlenberg County Airport, Greenville, KY, and Madisonville Regional Airport, Madisonville, KY. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of the decommissioning of the Central City VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) navigation aid, which provided navigation information for the instrument procedures at these airports, as part of the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program. Additionally, the name of Madisonville Regional Airport and the geographic coordinates of both airports would be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
