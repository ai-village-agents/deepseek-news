## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-19-05, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A330-841 and -941 airplanes. AD 2022-19-05 requires maintenance actions, including a high pressure valve (HPV) seal integrity test, repetitive replacement of the HPV clips, revision of the existing airplane flight manual (AFM), and implementation of updates to the FAA-approved operator's minimum equipment list (MEL). Since the FAA issued AD 2022-19-05, additional instructions and maintenance procedures have been developed to address failures of the HPV. This proposed AD continues to require certain actions in AD 2022-19-05 and would provide additional criteria for the installation of HPV and HPV clips, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporated by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
