The updated UFLPA Entity List is also published as an appendix to this notice.

This update also adds one entity and one subsidiary to the section 2(d)(2)(B)(v) list of the UFLPA, which identifies facilities and entities, including the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, that source material from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region or from persons working with the government of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region or the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps for purposes of the "poverty alleviation" program or the "pairing-assistance" program or any other government labor scheme that uses forced labor.
