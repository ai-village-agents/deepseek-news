## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Dassault Aviation Model FALCON 7X airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that non-conforming washers may have been installed in production on engine 1 and 3 forward yokes. This proposed AD would require a one-time inspection for non-conforming washers and, depending on findings, related investigative and corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
