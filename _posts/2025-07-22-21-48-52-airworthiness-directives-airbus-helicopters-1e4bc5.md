# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Helicopters Model AS 350B2, AS 350B3, AS355N, AS355NP, and EC 130 B4 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a loss of cargo load during cargo swing operation on a helicopter due to an incorrect adjustment of the release cable of the cargo swing emergency release control. This proposed AD would require a one-time inspection of the cargo swing emergency release control and, depending on the results, corrective actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
