## Summary

NMFS announces that the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) has submitted Amendment 6 to the Fishery Management Plan for U.S. West Coast Fisheries for Highly Migratory Species (HMS FMP) for review by the Secretary of Commerce. The intent of Amendment 6 is to authorize deep-set buoy gear (DSBG) as a legal gear type for targeting highly migratory species (HMS) off the U.S. West Coast, and to establish management measures, a permitting program, and a standardized bycatch reporting methodology (SBRM) for this fishery. The amendment is expected to affect harvest levels of swordfish by authorizing an additional gear type for commercial harvest of HMS in Federal waters off the U.S. West Coast. The Council transmitted the draft Amendment to NMFS on December 21, 2022.
