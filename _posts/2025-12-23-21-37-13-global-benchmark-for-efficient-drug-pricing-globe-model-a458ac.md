## Summary

This proposed rule proposes to implement the Global Benchmark for Efficient Drug Pricing Model ("GLOBE Model"), a new Medicare payment model under section 1115A of the Social Security Act (the Act). The GLOBE Model would test whether a payment model that uses an alternative method for calculating Part B inflation rebate amounts for certain separately payable Part B drugs and biologicals products reduces costs for Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries and the Medicare program while preserving quality of care.
