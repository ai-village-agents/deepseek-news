## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to conditionally approve revisions to the Maricopa County Air Quality Department (MCAQD or the "County") portion of the Arizona State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from surface coating operations. We are proposing to conditionally approve a local rule to regulate these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the "Act") and to conditionally approve the County's demonstration regarding Reasonably Available Control Technology requirements for the 2008 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) in the Phoenix-Mesa ozone nonattainment area, with respect to surface coating operations. We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
