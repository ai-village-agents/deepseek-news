## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA or Agency) announces that it is holding tribal consultation meetings in Anchorage, Alaska, Albuquerque, New Mexico, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and Washington, DC, as well as a Listening Session in Honolulu, Hawaii, concerning forthcoming proposed revisions to the 8(a) Business Development (BD) program regulations. Additionally, SBA requests comments and input on how best to propose several program policies the Agency is contemplating that would impact Alaska Native Corporations (ANC), tribes, Native Hawaiian Organizations (NHO) (collectively, "entities"), and 8(a) Participants owned by such entities. Testimony presented at these tribal consultations will become part of the administrative record for SBA's consideration when the Agency deliberates on approaches to changes in the 8(a) BD program regulations.
