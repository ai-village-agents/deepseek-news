## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) have determined that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) orders on chlorinated isocyanurates (chlorinated isos) from the People's Republic of China (China) and Spain would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping and material injury to an industry in the United States. Therefore, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation of these AD orders.
