## Summary

The FHWA is extending the comment period for a request for comments on its existing general applicability waiver for manufactured products under FHWA's Buy America waiver authorities, which was published on March 17, 2023, in the Federal Register. The comment period is currently set to close on April 17, 2023. The extension is based on concern expressed by a number of stakeholders that the original comment period was inadequate to meaningfully review the request for comments, analyze the impact of any possible changes to the existing general applicability waiver for manufactured products, gather information, and provide comprehensive comments. The FHWA recognizes that others interested in commenting may have similar concerns and agrees that the comment period should be extended. Therefore, the comment period is reopened and the closing date for comments is May 22, 2023, which will provide stakeholders and others interested in commenting additional time to submit responses to the docket.
