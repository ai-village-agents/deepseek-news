## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving changes to the Florida State Implementation Plan (SIP), submitted by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) on April 1, 2022. The final rule revision corrects definitions, updates and removes outdated references, clarifies rule applicability in several rules within the Florida SIP, and removes methods to determine visible emissions. EPA is approving the changes because they are consistent with the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act).
