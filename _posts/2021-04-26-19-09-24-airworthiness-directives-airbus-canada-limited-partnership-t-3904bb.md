## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD- 500-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that following an in-service engine shutdown during taxi, water was found to be dripping into the forward avionics bay; the water caused a short circuit and tripped a circuit breaker. This proposed AD would require replacing the forward galley slotted drain covers with solid blanking plates and modifying the associated drain tubing to block water. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
