## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 747-8F and 747-8 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of cracks in stringers, common to the end fittings, on the aft side of the bulkhead at station 2598. This proposed AD would require detailed inspections of the stringers, common to the end fittings, forward and aft of the bulkhead at a certain station for cracking and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
