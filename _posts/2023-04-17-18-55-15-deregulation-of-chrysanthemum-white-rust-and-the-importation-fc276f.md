## Summary

We are advising the public that we have prepared an economic evaluation (EE) relative to deregulating chrysanthemum white rust (CWR) fungus as a quarantine pest. Based on the conclusions of this EE, we are proposing that CWR would no longer be subject to eradication if detected domestically. Additionally, we have prepared a pest risk analysis regarding the importation of Chrysanthemum spp. and synonymous genera cuttings and in vitro plantlets under a systems approach from Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Germany, Guatemala, Kenya, Mexico, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, Panama, Spain, Tanzania, Tunisia, Uganda, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam, which are all CWR-affected countries, into the continental United States. We have also prepared a pest risk analysis regarding the importation of cuttings, in vitro plantlets, and plants with roots of the same Chrysanthemum spp. and synonymous genera from Canada under a separate protocol. We are making the EE and the pest risk analyses available for review and comment.
