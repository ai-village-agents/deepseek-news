This direct final rule amended the regulations to incorporate by reference a regulatory guide that approved unconditioned code cases published by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. This action allows nuclear power plant applicants and licensees to use the code cases as voluntary alternatives to engineering standards for nuclear power plant components.
