## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-14-14, which applies to all Alexander Schleicher GmbH & Co. Segelflugzeugbau Model ASW-15 gliders. AD 2022-14-14 requires repetitively inspecting the wing root ribs for cracks, looseness, and damage and replacing any root rib with a crack, a loose rib or lift pin bushing, or any damage. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-14-14, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) superseded its mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) to add all Model ASW-15B gliders to the applicability. This proposed AD is prompted by MCAI originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. This proposed AD would retain the requirements from AD 2022-14-14 of repetitively inspecting the wing root ribs for cracks, looseness, and damage and replacing any root rib with a crack, a loose rib or lift pin bushing, or any damage; and would add the Model ASW-15B gliders to the applicability. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
