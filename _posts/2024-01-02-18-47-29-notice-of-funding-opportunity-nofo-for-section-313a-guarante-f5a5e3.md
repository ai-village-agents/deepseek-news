## Summary

The Rural Utilities Service (RUS or the Agency), a Rural Development agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), announces the acceptance of applications under the Guarantees for Bonds and Notes Issued for Utility Infrastructure Purposes Program (the 313A Program) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2024. This notice is being issued in order to allow applicants sufficient time to prepare and submit their applications and give the Agency time to process applications within FY 2024. In FY 2023, the Agency made $900 million available for the 313A Program. Because full-year appropriations have not been enacted as of this date, the final amount that will be made available in FY 2024 will be determined by subsequent Congressional action. The agency is accepting applications up to the amount made available in FY 2023, subject to Congressional action. The purpose of the 313A Program is to guarantee loans to selected applicants as a Guaranteed Lender. Successful applications will be selected by the Agency for funding and subsequently awarded to the extent that funding may ultimately be made available through apportionment. All applicants are responsible for all expenses incurred in developing their applications.
