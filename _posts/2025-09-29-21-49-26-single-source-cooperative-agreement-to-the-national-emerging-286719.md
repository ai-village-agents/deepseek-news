## Summary

ASPR intends to provide a five-year single-source Cooperative Agreement (CoAg) to the National Emerging Special Pathogens Training and Education Center (NETEC).

The total proposed cost of the single-source CoAg is $7,730,000 for Fiscal Year (FY) 2025. Supporting collaboration between the U.S. Public Health Service and public and private community health programs and agencies to respond to health emergencies is an authority provided to HHS under section 311(c) of the Public Health Service Act.
