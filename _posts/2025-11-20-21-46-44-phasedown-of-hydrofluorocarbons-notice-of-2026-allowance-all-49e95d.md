## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued calendar year 2026 allowances for the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons in accordance with the Agency's regulations. This issuance of allowances is undertaken pursuant to the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act, which directs EPA by October 1 of each calendar year to determine the quantity of production and consumption allowances for the following calendar year. In this notice, EPA is also providing notice of separate Agency actions taken to establish administrative consequences for specific entities. These previously finalized actions withheld, retired, or revoked the identified entities' newly issued calendar year 2026 allowances in accordance with the administrative consequence regulatory provisions.
