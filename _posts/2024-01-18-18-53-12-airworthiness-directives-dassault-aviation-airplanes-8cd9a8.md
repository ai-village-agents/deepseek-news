## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-04- 10, which applied to all Dassault Aviation Model MYSTERE-FALCON 900 airplanes. AD 2023-04-10 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. This AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2023-04- 10, and requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations; as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
