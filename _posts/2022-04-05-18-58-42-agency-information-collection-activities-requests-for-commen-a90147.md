## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on June 24, 2021. The collection involves the information that each applicant for an aircraft dispatcher certificate or FAA approval of an aircraft dispatcher course must submit to the FAA. These applications, reports and training course materials are provided to the local Flight Standards District Office of the FAA that oversees the certificates and FAA approvals. The collection is necessary for the FAA to determine qualification and the ability of the applicant to safely dispatch aircraft. Without this collection of information, applicants for a certificate or course approval would not be able to receive certification or approval. The collection of information for those who choose to train aircraft dispatcher applicants is to protect the applicants by ensuring that they are properly trained.
