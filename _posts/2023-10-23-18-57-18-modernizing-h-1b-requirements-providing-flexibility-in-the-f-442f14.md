## Summary

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to amend its regulations governing H-1B specialty occupation workers to modernize and improve the efficiency of the H-1B program, add benefits and flexibilities, and improve integrity measures. Some of the proposed provisions would narrowly impact other nonimmigrant classifications, including: H-2, H-3, F-1, L-1, O, P, Q-1, R-1, E-3, and TN. DHS intends to finalize the proposals contained in this rulemaking through one or more final rules, depending on agency resources.
