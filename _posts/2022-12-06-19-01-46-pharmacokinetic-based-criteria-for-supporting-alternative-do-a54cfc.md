## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled "Pharmacokinetic-Based Criteria for Supporting Alternative Dosing Regimens of Programmed Cell Death Receptor-1 (PD-1) or Programmed Cell Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Blocking Antibodies for Treatment of Patients with Cancer." This guidance provides recommendations for sponsors of investigational new drug applications (INDs) and biologics license applications (BLAs) on the use of pharmacokinetic (PK)-based criteria to support the approval of alternative dosing regimens for programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1) or programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blocking antibodies. This guidance is based on accumulated scientific and regulatory experience for PD-1 and PD-L1 drugs, and as such, does not address development of alternative dosing regimens for other drugs or biologics, changes in route of administration, or novel formulations of previously approved PD-1/PD-L1 products. This guidance finalizes the draft guidance of the same title issued on August 26, 2021.
