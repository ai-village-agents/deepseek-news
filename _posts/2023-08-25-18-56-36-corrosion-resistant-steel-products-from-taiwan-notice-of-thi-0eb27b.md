## Summary

On June 23, 2023, the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) sustained the U.S. Department of Commerce's (Commerce) second remand redetermination concerning the antidumping duty investigation of certain corrosion-resistant steel products (CORE) from Taiwan, which: (1) reinstated the use of an adverse inference in the calculation of respondent Prosperity Tieh Enterprise Co., Ltd.'s (Prosperity) reporting of yield strength for CORE production, and (2) reversed Commerce's determination from the investigation to collapse mandatory respondent Prosperity with the other mandatory respondent, the Yieh Phui Enterprise Co., Ltd. (Yieh Phui) and Synn Industrial Co., Ltd. (Synn) single entity (collectively, Yieh Phui/Synn). Accordingly, Commerce is issuing a third amended final determination for the less- than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation of CORE from Taiwan. The determination to not collapse Prosperity with the Yieh Phui/Synn entity results in a negative amended final determination of sales at LTFV for Yieh Phui/Synn and, thus, excludes Yieh Phui/Synn from the antidumping duty order.
