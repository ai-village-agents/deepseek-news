## Summary

We are revising the criteria in the Listing of Impairments (listings) that we use to evaluate claims involving digestive disorders and skin disorders in adults and children under titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act (Act). The revisions reflect our adjudicative experience, advances in medical knowledge, and comments we received from the public in response to a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).
