## Summary

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is seeking comment on proposed corporate governance and risk management guidelines (Guidelines) that would apply to all insured state nonmember banks, state-licensed insured branches of foreign banks, and insured state savings associations that are subject to Section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act), with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more on or after the effective date of the final Guidelines. These proposed Guidelines would be issued as Appendix C to FDIC's standards for safety and soundness regulations in part 364, pursuant to Section 39 of the FDI Act, and would be enforceable under Section 39. The FDIC also proposes to make corresponding amendments to parts 308 and 364 of its regulations to implement the proposed Guidelines.
