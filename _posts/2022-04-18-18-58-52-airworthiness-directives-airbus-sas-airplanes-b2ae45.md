## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A318, A319, A320, and A321 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that damage (including delamination of work deck, and corroded and cracked retainer blocks) was found during inspection of certain galleys. This proposed AD would require repetitive inspections of certain galleys for corrosion of trolley retainer aluminum blocks and delamination of the upper panel of the trolley compartment, and applicable corrective action, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. This proposed AD would also limit the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
