## Summary

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) is amending Regulation V, which implements the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), to address recent legislation that assists consumers who are victims of trafficking. This final rule establishes a method for a victim of trafficking to submit documentation to consumer reporting agencies, including information identifying any adverse item of information about the consumer that resulted from certain types of human trafficking, and prohibits the consumer reporting agencies from furnishing a consumer report containing the adverse item(s) of information. The Bureau is taking this action as mandated by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 to assist consumers who are victims of trafficking in building or rebuilding financial stability and personal independence.
