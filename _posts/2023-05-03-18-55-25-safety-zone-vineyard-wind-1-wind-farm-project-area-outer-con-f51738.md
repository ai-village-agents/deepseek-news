## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish 63 temporary 500- meter safety zones around the construction of 62 wind turbine generators (WTGs) and one electrical service platform (ESP) located in the Vineyard Wind 1 Wind Farm (VW1WF) project area within federal waters on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), specifically in the northern portion of Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) Renewable Energy Lease Area OCS-A 0501, approximately 12 nautical miles (NM) offshore of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts and 12 NM offshore Nantucket, Massachusetts. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life, property, and the environment during the planned construction of each facility's monopile type foundation and subsequent installation of the WTGs turbines and ESP platform from June 15, 2023, to May 31, 2024. When enforced, only attending vessels and those vessels specifically authorized by the First Coast Guard District Commander, or a designated representative, are permitted to enter or remain in the temporary safety zones. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
