## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-19- 01, which applied to all Airbus Helicopters Model AS-365N2, AS 365 N3, EC 155B, EC155B1, SA-365N1, and SA-366G1 helicopters. AD 2018-19-01 required repetitive inspections of the aft fuselage outer skin. This AD continues to require repetitive inspections and adds Model SA-365N helicopters, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD was prompted by aft fuselage (baggage compartment area) outer skin disbonding and a determination that Model SA-365N helicopters are also affected by the unsafe condition identified in AD 2018-19-01. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
