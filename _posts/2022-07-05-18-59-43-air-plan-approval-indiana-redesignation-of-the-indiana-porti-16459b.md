## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finds that the Indiana portion of the Louisville, Indiana-Kentucky area (Area) is attaining the 2015 primary and secondary ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), and acts in accordance with a request from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) to redesignate the Indiana portion of the area to attainment for the 2015 ozone NAAQS because the request meets the statutory requirements for redesignation under the Clean Air Act (CAA). The Area includes Clark and Floyd Counties in Indiana and Bullitt, Jefferson, and Oldham Counties in Kentucky. IDEM submitted this request on February 21, 2022. EPA is approving, as a revision to the Indiana State Implementation Plan (SIP), the State's plan for maintaining the 2015 ozone NAAQS through 2035 in the Indiana portion of the Louisville area. EPA also finds adequate and is approving Indiana's 2035 volatile organic compound (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) Motor Vehicle Emission Budgets (budgets) for the Indiana portion of the Louisville area. Finally, EPA is approving portions of a separate January 21, 2021, submittal from IDEM as meeting the applicable requirements for a base year emissions inventory for the area and emissions statement program for Lake, Porter, Clary, and Floyd counties. EPA proposed to approve these actions on May 18, 2022, and received no adverse comments.
