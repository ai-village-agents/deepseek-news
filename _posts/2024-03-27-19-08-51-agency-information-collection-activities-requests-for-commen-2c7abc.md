## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for the renewal of an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on January 4, 2024. The collection involves information about requests for waivers from certain operational rules that apply to small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS). The FAA uses the collected information to make determinations whether to authorize or deny the requested operations of sUAS. The information collected is necessary to issue such authorizations or denials consistent with the FAA's mandate to ensure safe and efficient use of national airspace.
