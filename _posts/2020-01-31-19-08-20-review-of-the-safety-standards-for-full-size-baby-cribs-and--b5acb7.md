## Summary

The Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission or CPSC) is conducting a review of the safety standards for full-size baby cribs and non-full-size baby cribs under section 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA). That section requires the CPSC to review, within 10 years after their issuance, mandatory standards that have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The CPSC seeks comment to determine whether, consistent with the CPSC's statutory obligations, these standards should be maintained without change or modified to minimize significant impact of the rule on a substantial number of small entities.
