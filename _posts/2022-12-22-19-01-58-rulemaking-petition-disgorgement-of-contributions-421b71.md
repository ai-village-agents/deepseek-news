## Summary

On August 25, 2022, the Federal Election Commission received a Petition for Rulemaking asking the Commission to amend or clarify its regulations regarding the refunding of contributions that violate the source prohibitions or amount limitations of the Federal Election Campaign Act ("the Act"). The petitioner requests that the Commission amend its regulations to permit committees to disgorge illegal contributions to the United States Treasury, and to provide that the Commission may require disgorgement when, according to the petitioner, a refund would be unjust and create incentives for future lawbreaking.
