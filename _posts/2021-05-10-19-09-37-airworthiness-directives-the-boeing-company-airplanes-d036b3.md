## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 787-8 and 787-9 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports that shimming requirements were not met during the assembly of certain structural joints, which can result in reduced fatigue thresholds and cracking of the affected structural joints. This proposed AD would require repetitive inspections for cracking of certain areas of the aft wheel well bulkhead (AWWB) body chord and AWWB side fitting and failsafe straps, and repair of any cracking found. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
