## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Expanding PrEP in Communities of Color (EPICC). The proposed study is designed to deliver training to health providers on implementation of evidence-based tools to enhance the providers' ability to engage in PrEP screening, counseling, initiation and to provide support for adherence and persistence, and to test the effectiveness of the EPICC intervention.
