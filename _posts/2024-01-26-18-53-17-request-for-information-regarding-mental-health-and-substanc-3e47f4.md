## Summary

The U.S. Department of Education (Department) is requesting information in the form of written comments that may include information, research, and suggestions regarding supporting student mental health and/or substance use disorder (behavioral health) needs in higher education. The Office of Postsecondary Education solicits these comments: to identify examples of what has been effective in addressing college student mental health and substance use disorder needs; to learn how institutions of higher education (IHEs) have transformed their campus cultures and created campus-wide, inclusive strategies to provide support; to identify how State higher education agencies have supported college behavioral health; to better understand potential challenges institutions are facing in the design and implementation of solutions; and, ultimately, to inform future work from the Department.
