## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FMCSA announces its plan to submit the Information Collection Request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget for its review and approval and invites public comment. The FMCSA requests to renew an ICR titled, "Commercial Driver's License Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse." The Agency's final rule, published December 5, 2016, titled "Commercial Driver's License Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse" (81 FR 87686) (Clearinghouse) established the regulatory requirements for the Clearinghouse. The compliance date of the final rule was January 6, 2020. The FMCSA began collecting data as authorized users began registering in the Clearinghouse in September 2019. This ICR is needed to ensure that querying and reporting requirements are met to diminish the problem of commercial driver's license (CDL) and commercial learner's permit (CLP) holders who test positive for drugs or alcohol and then continue to perform safety sensitive functions, including driving a commercial motor vehicle (CMV), without participating in the required return-to-duty (RTD) process.
