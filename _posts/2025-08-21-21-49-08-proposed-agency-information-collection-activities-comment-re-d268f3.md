## Summary

In accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), the OCC, the Board, and the FDIC (the agencies) may not conduct or sponsor, and the respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. On May 9, 2025, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), of which the agencies are members, requested public comment for 60 days on a proposal to extend for three years, without revision, the Country Exposure Report (FFIEC 009) and the Country Exposure Information Report (FFIEC 009a), which are currently approved collections of information. The comment period for the May notice expired on July 8, 2025. As described in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section of this document, the agencies will proceed with the extension, without revision, of the FFIEC 009 and FFIEC 009a. In addition, the agencies are giving notice that they are sending the collections to OMB for review.
