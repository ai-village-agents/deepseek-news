## Summary

On July 28, 2022, FRA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that would require establishing safe minimum requirements for the size of train crews, depending on the type of operation. FRA is announcing a 67-day extension to the original comment period, which ends on September 26, 2022, and announcing that it will schedule a public hearing (within the extended comment period) in a forthcoming notification to provide interested persons an opportunity to comment on the proposal and to discuss further development of the regulation.
