## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its regulations to incorporate by reference a regulatory guide that approves unconditioned code cases published by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). This action would allow nuclear power plant applicants and licensees to use the code cases as voluntary alternatives to engineering standards for nuclear power plant components. These standards are set forth in the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code and ASME Operation and Maintenance of Nuclear Power Plants, which are currently incorporated by reference into the NRC's regulations. The NRC is requesting comments on this proposed rule.
