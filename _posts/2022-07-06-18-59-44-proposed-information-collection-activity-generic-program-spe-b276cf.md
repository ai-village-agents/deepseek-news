## Summary

This notice describes the proposal to extend data collection under the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) Generic Program-Specific Performance Progress Report (PPR) (0970-0490). This overarching generic allows ACF program offices to collect performance and progress data from recipients and sub-recipients who receive funding from ACF under a discretionary grant or cooperative agreement. This generic mechanism provides the opportunity for ACF program offices to tailor requests for performance and progress data to specific funding recipients. No changes are proposed to the purpose or use of the data collections under this generic, but ACF is requesting an increase in burden.
