## Summary

We, NMFS's West Coast Region (WCR), announce receipt of an application for an enhancement of survival permit (Number 25838) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973, and proposed entry into an associated Programmatic Safe Harbor Agreement (PSHA) between the NOAA Restoration Center (Applicant) and NMFS-WCR. The proposed enhancement of survival permit, which is issued by NMFS-WCR, and PSHA is intended to improve habitat conditions and promote the conservation and recovery of seven species of ESA-listed salmonids in Coastal California.
