## Summary

Pursuant to its authority under title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), the Department of Commerce (Commerce) proposes to modify its regulations governing procedures related to administrative protective orders (APO) and service of documents submitted in antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) proceedings. Commerce proposes to make permanent certain changes to its service procedures that have been adopted on a temporary basis due to COVID-19. Commerce also proposes additional clarifications and corrections to other procedural aspects of its AD/CVD regulations, including updates to the scope, circumvention, and covered merchandise referral regulations. Lastly, Commerce proposes to delete from its regulations two provisions that have been invalidated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit).
