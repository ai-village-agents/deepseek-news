## Summary

This interim final rule rescinds the Department of the Army regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), because the Council on Environmental Quality's (CEQ) NEPA regulations, which they were meant to supplement, have been rescinded, and because the DoD is promulgating Department-wide NEPA procedures that will guide the Army's NEPA process. In addition, this interim final rule requests comments on this action and related matters.
