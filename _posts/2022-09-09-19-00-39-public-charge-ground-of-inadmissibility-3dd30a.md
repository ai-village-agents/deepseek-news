## Summary

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is amending its regulations to prescribe how it determines whether noncitizens are inadmissible to the United States because they are likely at any time to become a public charge. Noncitizens who are applicants for visas, admission, and adjustment of status must establish that they are not likely at any time to become a public charge unless Congress has expressly exempted them from this ground of inadmissibility or has otherwise permitted them to seek a waiver of inadmissibility. Under this rule, DHS would determine that a noncitizen is likely at any time to become a public charge if the noncitizen is likely at any time to become primarily dependent on the government for subsistence, as demonstrated by either the receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance or long-term institutionalization at government expense. On August 14, 2019, DHS issued a different rule on this topic, Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds Final Rule (2019 Final Rule), which is no longer in effect. This rule implements a different policy than the 2019 Final Rule.
