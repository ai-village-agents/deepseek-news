## Summary

The Office of Community Services (OCS), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is requesting a 3-year extension of the Community Economic Development (CED) Performance Progress Report (PPR) (Office of Management and Budget (OMB) #: 0970-0386, expiration date February 28, 2026) with revisions to support a quarterly reporting schedule. This request revises the burden estimates to reflect new reporting requirements for quarterly reporting. While the core CED PPR form remains unchanged and will still be submitted semi-annually, new awardees must now report quarterly. In alternate quarters (Q1 and Q3), they will complete a shorter version of the form with narrative updates only.
