## Summary

The National Park Service (NPS) proposes to amend the special regulations for Assateague Island National Seashore to remove certain permit eligibility requirements for motor vehicles that drive on designated beaches and oversand routes. The rulemaking would eliminate requirements addressing vehicle weight, ground clearance, and dimensions. These requirements were established in 1976 and are no longer necessary. In addition, the NPS proposes to make several technical, non-substantive changes to the regulations.
