## Summary

The FAA is withdrawing a previously published notice of proposed rulemaking that proposed to amend the regulations governing the operating limitations for certain experimental light-sport aircraft. The rulemaking proposed to remove the date restriction that currently prevents flight training on these aircraft and add language to permit training in certain experimental light-sport aircraft for compensation or hire through existing deviation authority. The FAA is withdrawing this action because the FAA is concurrently publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking to address the framework of flight training in certain aircraft holding special airworthiness certificates, which will include experimental light-sport aircraft.
