## Summary

The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is amending the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to clarify controls on radiation hardened integrated circuits, including controls on computer and telecommunications equipment incorporating such radiation hardened integrated circuits. This rule also addresses certain scenarios that apply to certain integrated circuits acquired, tested, or otherwise used by or for the United States Government and affirms the availability of License Exception GOV for such items when pursuant to an official written request or directive from the Department of Defense or the Department of Energy. Lastly, this rule expands the availability of License Exception GOV for microelectronics items being exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) in furtherance of a contract between the exporter, reexporter, or transferor and a department or agency of the U.S. Government when the contract provides for the export, reexport, transfer (in-country) of the item by the exporter, reexporter, or transferor in order to remove export control obstacles for official business of the U.S. Government, including the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense.
