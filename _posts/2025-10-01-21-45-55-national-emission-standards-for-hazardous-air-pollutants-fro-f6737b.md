## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing amendments to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for the Secondary Lead Smelting source category ("Secondary Lead Smelting NESHAP") under Clean Air Act (CAA) section 112. The EPA did not identify any cost-effective developments in practices, processes, and/or control technologies and is not proposing changes to the Secondary Lead Smelting NESHAP as a result of the technology review. The EPA is proposing to address previously unregulated hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from this source category. We are also addressing outstanding petition issues from the 2012 Secondary Lead Smelting (RTR), hereafter referred to as the 2012 RTR. In response to the petitions, we are taking comment on our conclusion in the 2012 RTR that the Secondary Lead Smelting NESHAP provides an ample margin of safety to protect public health and on two additional provisions. In addition, the EPA is proposing revisions related to emissions during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction; to add requirements for electronic reporting; to revise monitoring requirements; and to make other minor technical revisions.
