## Summary

FDA is issuing this draft guidance as part of a series of guidance documents under its Real-World Evidence (RWE) Program and to satisfy, in part, a mandate under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) to issue guidance about the use of RWE in regulatory decision-making. This draft guidance includes recommendations to sponsors and investigators considering the use of externally controlled trials to provide evidence of the safety and effectiveness of a drug product.
