## Summary

This advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) seeks the public's input on changes that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD or the Department) is considering to its implementing regulations for Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) for federally assisted and HUD conducted programs and activities. Section 504 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in all programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance and in programs and activities conducted by executive agencies. After this ANPRM is published, the Department intends to draft a Notice of a Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that would propose the adoption of an updated Federal accessibility standard for purposes of compliance with HUD's Section 504 regulations. In addition, the Department intends for this NPRM to propose revisions to HUD's Section 504 regulations to clarify recipients' obligations, including how to account for advances in accessible design, information and communication technology, and assistive technologies that have become available since HUD's Section 504 regulations were originally published in 1988.
