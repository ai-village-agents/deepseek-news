## Summary

This rule delays the effective date of the final rule entitled, "Security Training for Surface Transportation Employees" from June 22, 2020, until September 21, 2020. TSA has concluded that many owner/operators within the regulated community may be unable to meet deadlines in the rule because of actions taken at various levels of government to address the COVID-19 crisis. TSA is, therefore, extending the effective date of the rule and related compliance deadlines.
