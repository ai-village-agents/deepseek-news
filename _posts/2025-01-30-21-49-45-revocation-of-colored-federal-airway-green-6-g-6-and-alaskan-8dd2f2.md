## Summary

This action proposes to revoke Colored Federal Airway Green 6 (G-6) and Alaskan Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal Airways V-459 and V-496 in Alaska. The identifier V-459 is also used for a VOR Federal Airway in California. This action is proposing to revoke the Alaskan V-459, not the V-459 in California. The FAA is proposing this action due to the pending decommissioning of the St. Marys, AK, Nondirectional Radio Beacon (NDB) and the Aniak, AK, NDB.
