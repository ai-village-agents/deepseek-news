## Summary

This final rule adds new requirements and a specified process to address change of ownership (CHOW) for Accrediting Organizations (AOs) in regard to the transfer of the existing Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) approval for the AO's accreditation programs to the new AO owner. These regulations are intended to provide CMS with the ability to receive notice when an AO is undergoing or negotiating a CHOW, as well as to review the prospective new AO owner's capability to perform its tasks after a CHOW has occurred, in order to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of the transferred accreditation program(s) and to minimize risk to patient safety.
