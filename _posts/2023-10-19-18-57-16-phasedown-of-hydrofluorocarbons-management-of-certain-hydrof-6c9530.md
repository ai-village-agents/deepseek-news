## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is proposing to issue regulations to implement certain provisions of the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act of 2020. This rulemaking proposes to establish a program for the management of hydrofluorocarbons that includes requirements for leak repair and use of automatic leak detection systems for certain equipment using refrigerants containing hydrofluorocarbons and certain substitutes; requirements for the use of reclaimed hydrofluorocarbons in certain sectors or subsectors; the use of recycled hydrofluorocarbons in fire suppression equipment; recovery of hydrofluorocarbons from cylinders; container tracking; and certain recordkeeping, reporting, and labeling requirements. The Environmental Protection Agency is also proposing alternative Resource Conservation and Recovery Act standards for spent ignitable refrigerants being recycled for reuse. Finally, EPA requests advance comment on approaches for establishing requirements for technician training and/or certification.
