## Summary

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) invites public comment on one currently approved Information Collection Request (ICR), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number 1652-0059, abstracted below that we will submit to OMB for a revision in compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). This ICR is being revised to inform the public of the official launch of new TSA PreCheck<SUP>TM</SUP> enrollment providers, which has led to multiple price points for enrollments and renewals and additional enrollment locations; exploration of new enrollment capabilities to include remotely proctored enrollment; acceptance of Mobile Drivers Licenses and other Digital Identities upon TSA approval; and, revised customer experience surveys to better service the public. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected burden. The collection involves the voluntary submission of biographic and biometric information that TSA uses to verify identity and conduct a security threat assessment (STA) for the TSA PreCheck<SUP>TM</SUP> Application Program. The STA compares an applicant's information against criminal history, immigration, intelligence, and regulatory violations databases to determine if the person poses a low risk to transportation or national security and should be eligible for expedited screening through TSA PreCheck<SUP>TM</SUP> lanes at airports.
