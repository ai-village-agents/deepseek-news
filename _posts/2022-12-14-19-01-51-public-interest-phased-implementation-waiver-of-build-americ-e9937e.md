## Summary

In accordance with the Build America, Buy America Act ("BABA" or "the Act") this notice advises that HUD has issued a public interest waiver to further HUD's phased implementation of the Buy America Domestic Content Procurement Preference ("Buy America Preference," or "BAP") for recipients of Federal Financial Assistance ("FFA") provided by HUD. On May 5, 2022, HUD previously issued a separate waiver covering all FFA obligated by HUD on or before November 14, 2022, including Community Development Block Grant ("CDBG") formula grants. In order to fully focus on the successful implementation of the BAP in CDBG formula grants, one of HUD's largest grant programs, HUD has determined that it is in the public interest to issue a new public interest waiver of the application of the BAP for all other FFA obligated by HUD. By this notice, HUD announces that it is waiving the application of the BAP on or after the effective date of this waiver for all FFA obligated by HUD on or before February 21, 2023, except for those funds utilized in connection with the purchase of iron or steel products in infrastructure projects funded by CDBG formula grants obligated by HUD on or after November 15, 2022. In addition, in the case of FFA obligated by HUD on or after November 15, 2022 but prior to the effective date of the final waiver, HUD is waiving the application of the BAP for all expenditures incurred on or after the date of the final waiver, except for those funds utilized in connection with the purchase of iron or steel products in infrastructure projects funded by CDBG formula grants obligated by HUD on or after November 15, 2022.
