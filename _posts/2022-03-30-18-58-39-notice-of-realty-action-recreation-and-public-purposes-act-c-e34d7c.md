## Summary

Pinal County, AZ, filed an application with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to develop three parcels of BLM-managed land as part of a regional park that will help meet expanding recreational needs in the area near Maricopa, AZ. The BLM, Lower Sonoran Field Office, examined the three parcels consisting of approximately 497 acres of public land and determined that the parcels are suitable for classification under the provisions of the Recreation and Public Purposes (R&PP) Act, as amended. The R&PP Act allows local governments to lease, develop, and subsequently acquire public lands for recreation and other public purposes if compliant with local government and BLM land use planning. The R&PP project is consistent with the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, as amended, and associated BLM regulations and policies.
