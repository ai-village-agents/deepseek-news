## Summary

In accordance with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), notice is hereby given that a proposed CERCLA Section 122(h)(1) Cashout Settlement Agreement for Ability to Pay Peripheral Parties ("Proposed Agreement") associated with the Donna Reservoir and Canal Superfund Site in Donna, Hidalgo County, Texas ("Site") was executed by the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and is now subject to public comment, after which EPA may modify or withdraw its consent if comments received disclose facts or considerations that indicate that the Proposed Agreement is inappropriate, improper, or inadequate.

The settlement is $100,000 and was based on an Ability to Pay Analysis, which concluded the settling party shall make payment for EPA response costs. For thirty (30) days following the date of publication of this notice, EPA will receive electronic comments relating to the Proposed Agreement. EPA's response to any comments received will be available for public inspection by request.
