## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves submission of an AC Form 8050-5, Dealer's Aircraft Registration Certificate Application, by companies or individuals to obtain a Dealer's Aircraft Registration Certificate, which allows operation of an aircraft instead of obtaining a permanent aircraft registration certificate. The information collection is necessary for a dealer to operate an aircraft without a permanent aircraft registration certificate and to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements.
