# Bayer; Availability of a Draft Environmental Impact Statement and a Draft Plant Risk Assessment for Determination of Nonregulated Status for Maize Developed Using Genetic Engineering for Dicamba, Glufosinate, Quizalofop, and 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid Resistance, With Tissue-Specific Glyphosate Resistance Facilitating the Production of Hybrid Maize Seed

## Summary

We are advising the public that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has prepared a draft environmental impact statement (EIS) and draft plant pest risk assessment (PPRA) evaluating the potential environmental impacts and plant pest risk that may result from the approval of a petition for nonregulated status for maize developed using genetic engineering for dicamba, glufosinate, quizalofop, and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic resistance with tissue- specific glyphosate resistance facilitating the production of hybrid maize seed. We are making the draft EIS and draft PPRA available for public review and comment.
