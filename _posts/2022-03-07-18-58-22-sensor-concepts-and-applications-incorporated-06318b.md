## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff has received an application from Sensor Concepts and Applications, Incorporated (SCA or the licensee) to renew Special Nuclear Materials (SNM) License No. SNM-2017. The renewed license would authorize the applicant to continue to use SNM in greater than critical mass quantities for research and development of radiation detection instrumentation at its location in Glen Arm, Maryland as well as other locations selected by the United States Department of Defense. This license renewal, if approved, would authorize SCA to continue licensed activities for 10 years beyond its current license.
