## Summary

Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has determined to affirm an initial determination ("ID") (Order No. 11) of the then-presiding chief administrative law judge ("CALJ") granting summary determination that certain defaulting respondents have violated section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, by importing, selling for importation, or selling in the United States after importation certain apparatus and methods of opening containers that infringe claim 12 of U.S. Patent No. 10,519,016 ("the '016 patent"). The Commission has determined that the appropriate remedy is a general exclusion order excluding infringing container opening apparatuses. The Commission has also determined to set a bond in the amount of 100 percent of the entered value of the excluded products imported during the period of Presidential review. This investigation is hereby terminated.
