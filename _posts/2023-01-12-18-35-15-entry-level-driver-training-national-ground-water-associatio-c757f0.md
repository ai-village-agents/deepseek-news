## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to deny the exemption request from the National Ground Water Association (NGWA). NGWA sought an exemption from the entry-level driver training (ELDT) regulations "for individuals operating class B ground water well drilling rigs." FMCSA analyzed the exemption application and public comments and determined that the exemption would not achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent such exemption.
