## Summary

NIFA is soliciting topics commodity board entities (Federal and State-level commodity boards, as defined below) are willing to co- fund equally with NIFA. To be considered for inclusion in future Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) competitive grants program Requests for Applications (RFAs), topics must relate to the established priority areas of AFRI. Commodity boards are those entities established under a commodity promotion law, as such term is defined under the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, or a State commodity board or other equivalent State entity. See the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section of this Notice under the heading "Eligibility for Submitting Topics" for further information.
