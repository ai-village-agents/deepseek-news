## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-12-01, which applies to certain Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd. & Co KG (RRD) Trent XWB-75, Trent XWB-79, Trent XWB-79B, and Trent XWB-84 model turbofan engines. AD 2020-12-01 requires initial and repetitive inspections of the low-pressure compressor (LPC) outlet guide vane (OGV) outer mount ring assembly and, depending on the results of the inspections, possible replacement of the LPC OGV outer mount ring assembly. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-12-01, it was determined that these inspections are also necessary for RRD Trent XWB-97 model turbofan engines. This proposed AD would require initial and repetitive inspections of the LPC OGV outer mount ring assembly and, depending on the results of the inspections, replacement of the LPC OGV outer mount ring assembly, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
