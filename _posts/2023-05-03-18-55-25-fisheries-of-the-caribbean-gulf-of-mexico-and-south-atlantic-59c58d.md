## Summary

This final temporary rule implements interim measures to reduce overfishing of gag in Federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf). This final temporary rule reduces the 2023 commercial and recreational sector harvest levels for gag and changes the 2023 recreational fishing season for gag in Federal waters of the Gulf. This temporary rule is effective for 180 days, but NMFS may extend the interim measures for a maximum of an additional 186 days. The purpose of this temporary rule is to reduce overfishing of gag while the long- term management measures are developed.
