## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-02-02 which applied to certain Bell Textron Inc. (type certificate previously held by Bell Helicopter Textron Inc.) Model 204B, 205A, 205A-1, 205B, 210, and 212 helicopters with a certain main rotor hub strap pin (pin) installed. AD 2022-02-02 required removing certain outboard pins from service and prohibited installing them on any helicopter. This AD expands the applicability to all affected pins, regardless if they are outboard or inboard. This AD also requires inspecting the removed pin for any deformation and if it is deformed, removing the mating strap fitting (fitting) from service. This AD was prompted by the discovery that AD 2022-02-02 inadvertently limited its applicability to only outboard pins when, in fact, all pins are subject to the unsafe condition and the determination that a deformed pin may have damaged the fitting. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
