## Summary

The FAA is revising an earlier proposal for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, and -900 series airplanes. This action revises the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) by revising certain inspections to provide the correct thickness callouts for the fuselage skin and bear strap. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive (AD) to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over that in the NPRM, the FAA is reopening the comment period to allow the public the chance to comment on these changes.
