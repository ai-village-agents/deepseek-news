## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of Government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Workplans for Regional Centers to Enhance Public Health Preparedness and Response. This data collection is designed to support regional centers' creation of a five-year workplan which addresses focus areas that would benefit from use of new or enhanced evidence- based strategies (EBSI), existing and needed approaches to meet regional emergency preparedness and EBSI needs, proposed measures to ensure strategies and interventions are effectively implemented, and regional sustainability of evidence-based practice beyond the five-year workplan.
