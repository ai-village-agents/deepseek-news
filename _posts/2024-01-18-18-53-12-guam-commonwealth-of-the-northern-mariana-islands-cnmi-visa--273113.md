## Summary

This rule amends the Department of Homeland Security regulations to require persons intending to travel to Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) under the Guam-CNMI Visa Waiver Program (G-CNMI VWP) to submit Form I-736 electronically in advance of travel and receive an electronic travel authorization prior to embarking on a carrier for travel to Guam or the CNMI. Under the current G-CNMI VWP regulations, a paper U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Form I-736 is presented to CBP upon arrival. This rule also establishes the CNMI Economic Vitality & Security Travel Authorization Program (EVS-TAP) as a restricted sub-program of the G- CNMI VWP. This program is being established based on recommendations made pursuant to consultations between the United States and the CNMI under Section 902 of the Covenant to Establish the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America. Once implemented, the CNMI EVS-TAP will allow prescreened nationals of the People's Republic of China to travel to the CNMI without a visa under specified conditions.
