## Summary

The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) annually hosts BARDA Industry Day (BID), a two-day conference with industry and our government partners to share BARDA's goals and objectives, increase awareness of U.S. government medical countermeasure (MCM) priorities, and facilitate collaboration between public and private sectors within the health security space. This year, BARDA plans to discuss implementation efforts for our 2022-2026 Strategic Plan, which focuses on strengthening the health security of the nation, embracing lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, incorporating new avenues of promising research and development, and addressing the imperative for MCMs that are safe, effective, and widely accessible.
