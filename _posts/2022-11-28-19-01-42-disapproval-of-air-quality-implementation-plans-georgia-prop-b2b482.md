## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to disapprove a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Georgia through the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (GA EPD) on November 17, 2016. The revision was submitted by Georgia in response to a finding of substantial inadequacy and SIP call published on June 12, 2015, for a provision in the Georgia SIP related to excess emissions during startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) events. EPA is proposing to disapprove the SIP revision and to determine that the SIP revision fails to correct the deficiencies identified in the June 12, 2015, SIP call in accordance with the requirements for SIP provisions under the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act).
