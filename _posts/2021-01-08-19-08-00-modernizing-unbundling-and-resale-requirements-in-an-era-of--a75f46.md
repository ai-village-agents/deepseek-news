## Summary

In this document, the Commission eliminates unbundling requirements, subject to reasonable transition periods, for enterprise- grade DS1 and DS3 loops here there is evidence of actual and potential competition, for broadband-capable DS0 loops and subloops in the most densely populated areas, for operations support systems nationwide except for the purposes of managing remaining UNEs, number portability, and interconnection, and for voice-grade narrowband loops, multiunit premises subloops, and network interface devices nationwide. The Commission preserves unbundling requirements for DS0 loops in less densely populated areas and DS1 and DS3 loops in areas without sufficient evidence of competition. The Commission further eliminates unbundled dark fiber transport provisioned from wire centers within a half-mile of competitive fiber networks, but provides an eight-year transition period for existing circuits so as to avoid stranding investment and last-mile deployment by competitive LECs that may harm consumers. The Report and Order also forbears from remaining Avoided- Cost Resale obligations. In all, the Commission ends unbundling and resale requirements where they stifle technology transitions and broadband deployment, but preserves unbundling requirements where they are still necessary to realize the 1996 Act's goal of robust intermodal competition benefiting all Americans.
