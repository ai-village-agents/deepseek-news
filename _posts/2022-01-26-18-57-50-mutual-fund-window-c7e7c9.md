## Summary

The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) will make a mutual fund window available to participants in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), beginning in the summer of 2022. The FRTIB is proposing a fee designed to guarantee that the availability of the mutual fund window will not indirectly increase the share of TSP administrative expenses borne by participants who choose not to use the mutual fund window. The FRTIB is also proposing rules and procedures to govern fund transfers to and from the mutual fund window.
