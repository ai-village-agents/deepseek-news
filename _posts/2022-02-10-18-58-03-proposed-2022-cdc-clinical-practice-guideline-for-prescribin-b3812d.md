## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), announces the opening of a docket to obtain comment on the proposed clinical practice guideline, CDC Clinical Practice Guideline for Prescribing Opioids--United States, 2022 (the clinical practice guideline). The clinical practice guideline updates and expands the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain--United States, 2016, and provides evidence-based recommendations for clinicians who provide pain care, including those prescribing opioids, for outpatients age 18 years and older with acute pain (duration less than 1 month), subacute pain (duration of 1-3 months), or chronic pain (duration of 3 months or more), not including sickle cell disease-related pain management, cancer pain treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care. The clinical practice guideline includes recommendations for primary care clinicians (including physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants) as well as for outpatient clinicians in other specialties (including those managing dental and postsurgical pain in outpatient settings and emergency clinicians providing pain management for patients being discharged from emergency departments). This voluntary clinical practice guideline provides recommendations and does not require mandatory compliance; and the clinical practice guideline is intended to be flexible so as to support, not supplant, clinical judgment and individualized, patient-centered decision-making.
