## Summary

The National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) has released a draft of a revised Introduction Chapter of the Comprehensive Plan for the National Capital: Federal Elements for public review. The chapter establishes the planning framework for the Comprehensive Plan's Federal Elements to guide agency actions, including review of projects and long-range plans that affect federal buildings, installations, campuses, and master plans in the National Capital Region. The revisions include references to equity considerations. A Notice of a 90-day Public Comment Period and Public Meetings for updates to the Submission Guidelines related to equity is published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register. NCPC will host two public information sessions for the public to learn more about the draft revisions. The draft Introduction Chapter is available online for review at https:// www.ncpc.gov/initiatives/Intro.
