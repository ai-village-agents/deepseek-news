## Summary

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended ("EPCA"), prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment, including unfired hot water storage tanks ("UFHWSTs"). EPCA also requires the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE" or "the Department") to periodically determine whether more-stringent, amended standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would result in significant additional energy savings. In this final determination, DOE determines that the energy conservation standards for UFHWSTs do not need to be amended. DOE has determined that it lacks clear and convincing evidence that more-stringent standards for UFHWSTs would save a significant additional amount of energy and would be economically justified.
