## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for certain waters of Seneca Lake near Sampson State Park, Romulus, NY. The safety zone is needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards created by a fireworks display. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the safety zone from 9:30 p.m. through 10:30 p.m., July 3, 2024 unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Eastern Great Lakes or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
