## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 717-200 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that during takeoff, both the captain's and first officer's airspeed indications froze at 80 knots. This AD requires modifying the air data heat (ADH) system to display the proper airspeed indications, testing, and any applicable corrective actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
