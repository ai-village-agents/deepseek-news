## Summary

This proposed rule would adjust the number of members on the United Soybean Board (Board) to reflect changes in production levels that have occurred since the Board was last reapportioned in 2018. As required by the Soybean Promotion, Research, and Consumer Information Act (Act), membership on the Board is reviewed every 3 years and adjustments are made accordingly. This proposed change would result in a decrease in Board membership for one State, decreasing the total number of Board members from 78 to 77. These changes would be reflected in the Soybean Promotion and Research Order (Order) and would be effective with the Secretary of Agriculture's (Secretary) appointments for terms in the year 2022. This proposed rule would also correct the number of States and units to the Order. Technical corrections to the regulations would adjust the number of States and units from 30 to 31.
