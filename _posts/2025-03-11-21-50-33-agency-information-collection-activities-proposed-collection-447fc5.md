## Summary

As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) requests comments on a request for approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for a new information collection. The proposed collection is for an application by which potential grant recipients may request funding under CPSC's Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Prevention Grant Program (COPPGP). The COPPGP provides funds for state, local and tribal governments to reduce the number of injuries and deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning. Before CPSC may collect this information from the public, it must solicit public comment on this proposed collection of information and receive OMB approval. This notice describes the collection of information for which CPSC intends to seek OMB approval.
