## Summary

The Department of Transportation (DOT) is finalizing a general applicability public interest waiver of the requirements of section 70914(a) of the Build America, Buy America Act (BABA) and related domestic preference statutes administered by DOT and its Operating Administrations (OAs) for federal financial assistance awarded for infrastructure projects located in the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), Guam, and American Samoa, collectively referred to as the Pacific Island territories. The waiver would also apply to discretionary grant assistance provided by DOT to the Freely Associated States (the Republic of Palau, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Federated States of Micronesia) in the Pacific that is subject to a domestic preference statute (which does not include BABA, as that statute only applies to the United States and its territories). The waiver will remain in effect for five years after the effective date of the final waiver. This action also terminates the previously issued temporary general applicability waiver for this region.
