## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of Ledprona double-stranded (ds) RNA in or on potato when used as a foliar-applied insecticide for the selective control of Colorado potato beetle and in accordance with label directions and good agricultural practices. GreenLight Biosciences, Inc. submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of Ledprona dsRNA under FFDCA when used in accordance with this exemption.
