## Summary

This document amends the FM Table of Allotments, of the Federal Communications Commission's (Commission) rules, by substituting Channel 287A for vacant Channel 280A at Peach Springs, Arizona to accommodate the hybrid modification application for Station KIDD(FM), Fort Mohave, Arizona to specify operation on Channel 280C2 in lieu of Channel 280A. A staff engineering analysis indicates that Channel 287A can be allotted to Peach Springs, Arizona, consistent with the minimum distance separation requirements of the Commission's rules, with a site restriction of 12.6 km (7.8 miles) northeast of the community. The reference coordinates are 35-33-18 NL and 113-18-02 WL.
