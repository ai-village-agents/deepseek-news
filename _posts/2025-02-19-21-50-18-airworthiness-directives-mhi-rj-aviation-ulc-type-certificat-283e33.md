## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all MHI RJ Aviation ULC (type certificate previously held by Bombardier, Inc.) Model CL-600-2C10 (Regional Jet Series 700, 701 & 702), CL-600-2C11 (Regional Jet Series 550), CL-600-2D15 (Regional Jet Series 705), CL-600-2D24 (Regional Jet Series 900), and CL-600-2E25 (Regional Jet Series 1000) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports that the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) impact switch was installed in the wrong direction. This proposed AD would require an inspection of the CVR impact switch installation to confirm that the reset switch faces forward, and applicable on-condition actions, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
