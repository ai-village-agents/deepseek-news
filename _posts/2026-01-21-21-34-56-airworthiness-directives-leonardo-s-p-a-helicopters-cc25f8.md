## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Leonardo S.p.A. Model AB139 and AW139 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of a damaged spare inflation system of a certain life raft kit due to the inappropriate shipment of the parts. This proposed AD would require replacing certain life raft inflation systems and would prohibit the installation of an affected life raft inflation system on any helicopter. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
