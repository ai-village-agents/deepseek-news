## Summary

This final rule adopts and replaces regulations relating to key aspects of the placement, care, and services provided to unaccompanied children referred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), pursuant to ORR's responsibilities for coordinating and implementing the care and placement of unaccompanied children who are in Federal custody by reason of their immigration status under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (HSA) and the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA). This final rule establishes a foundation for the Unaccompanied Children Program (UC Program) that is consistent with ORR's statutory duties, for the benefit of unaccompanied children and to enhance public transparency as to the policies governing the operation of the UC Program. This final rule implements the 1997 Flores Settlement Agreement (FSA). As modified in 2001, the FSA provides that it will terminate 45 days after publication of final regulations implementing the agreement. ORR anticipates that any termination of the settlement based on this final rule would only be effective for those provisions that affect ORR and would not terminate provisions of the FSA that apply to other Federal Government agencies.
