## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Fokker Services B.V. Model F28 Mark 0070 and 0100 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report indicating that a passenger door opened under residual cabin pressure during taxiing after landing, and following the display of the CAB PRESS CTL alert. This AD requires revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to update the Cabin Pressurization Control Fault procedure, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
