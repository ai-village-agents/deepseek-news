## Summary

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is seeking public feedback on its existing patent subject matter eligibility guidance. The existing guidance, put in place in 2019, has contributed to more consistent examination. But there is more work to be done to impart clarity and certainty into patent eligibility. In addition to working with Congress on potential changes to the law and looking for opportunities in the courts, the USPTO is updating its guidance and has been seeking public input on the same. Given the overwhelming interest in the guidance, the USPTO will now accept feedback via the Federal eRulemaking Portal until October 15, 2022.
