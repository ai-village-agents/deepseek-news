## Summary

The Department of Labor (Department) proposes regulations to implement Executive Order 14055, Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers Under Service Contracts, signed by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. on November 18, 2021. The order establishes a general policy of the Federal Government that service contracts which succeed contracts for the same or similar services, and solicitations for such contracts, shall include a non-displacement clause. The non-displacement clause requires the contractor and its subcontractors to offer qualified employees employed under the predecessor contract a right of first refusal of employment under the successor contract. The Executive order also directs the Secretary of Labor (Secretary) to issue regulations to implement the requirements of this order. The order further directs that within 60 days of the Secretary issuing final regulations, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council) shall amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to provide for inclusion of the clause in section 3 of the order. Finally, the order requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to issue guidance to implement section 6(c) of this order.
