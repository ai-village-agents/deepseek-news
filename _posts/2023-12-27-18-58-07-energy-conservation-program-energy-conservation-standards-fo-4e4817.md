## Summary

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended ("EPCA"), prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment, including consumer water heaters. On July 28, 2023, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE" or "the Department") proposed amended energy conservation standards for certain consumer water heaters, including circulating water heaters, along with supporting definitions. In this supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking ("SNOPR") DOE proposes to amend the definition for circulating water heaters and clarify that circulating water heaters would be subject to the proposed energy conservation standards for storage-type water heaters. DOE requests comment on these proposed definitions.
