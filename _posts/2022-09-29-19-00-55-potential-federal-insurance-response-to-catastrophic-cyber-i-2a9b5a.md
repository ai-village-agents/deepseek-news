## Summary

Over the past several years, the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) in the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) has continued its ongoing efforts with regard to both cyber insurance and insurer cybersecurity. Cyber insurance is a significant risk-transfer mechanism, and the insurance industry has an important role to play in strengthening cyber hygiene and building resiliency. FIO has also increased its data collection in this area with regard to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIP) and has supported the development of Treasury's counter-ransomware strategy. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report in June 2022 recommending that FIO and the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) conduct a joint assessment to determine "the extent to which risks to critical infrastructure from catastrophic cyber incidents and potential financial exposures warrant a federal insurance response." Both FIO and CISA have agreed to conduct the recommended assessment. FIO is also coordinating with the White House Office of the National Cyber Director on these issues. In order to inform FIO's future work and the joint assessment, FIO is seeking comments from the public on questions related to cyber insurance and catastrophic cyber incidents.
