## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-22- 02, which applied to all The Boeing Company Model 747-200B, 747-200C, 747-200F, 747-300, 747-400, 747-400D, 747-400F, 747-8F, and 747-8 series airplanes. AD 2019-22-02 required identifying the part number, and the serial number if applicable, of the Captain's and First Officer's seats, and applicable on-condition actions for affected seats. AD 2019-22-02 also required a one-time detailed inspection and repetitive checks of the horizontal movement system (HMS) of the Captain's and First Officer's seats, and applicable on-condition actions. This AD was prompted by reports of uncommanded fore and aft movement of the Captain's and First Officer's seats. This AD requires the actions in AD 2019-22-02 and adds an inspection of previously omitted part numbers. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
