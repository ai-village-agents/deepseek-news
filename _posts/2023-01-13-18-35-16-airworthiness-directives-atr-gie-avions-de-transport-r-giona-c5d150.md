# Airworthiness Directives; ATR-GIE Avions de Transport Régional Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain ATR--GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42- 500 and 72-212A airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by in-service experience that has shown that the lateral flight guidance of the flight director/auto pilot may not limit HI BANK turns in severe icing conditions. This proposed AD would require the replacement of the affected new avionics suite (NAS), as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of the affected NAS on any airplane. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
