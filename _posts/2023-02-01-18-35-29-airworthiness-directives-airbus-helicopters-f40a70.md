## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model AS350B, AS350BA, AS350B1, AS350B2, AS350B3, AS350D, AS355E, AS355F, AS355F1, AS355F2, AS355N, and AS355NP helicopters. This AD was prompted by an occurrence reported where during an inspection of a tail rotor head (TRH) pitch change spider, excessive play and excessive wear were detected, due to an unwanted rotating motion. This AD requires for helicopters with certain part- numbered TRH spider pitch change units installed, inspecting for correct installation of the spider pitch change nut (nut); marking a 2 to 5 mm wide black paint index mark and repetitively inspecting the alignment of the marking; and additional inspections and corrective actions if necessary. This AD also allows an affected part to be installed on a helicopter if certain requirements of this AD are met. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
