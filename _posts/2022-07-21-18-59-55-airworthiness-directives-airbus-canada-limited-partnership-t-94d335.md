## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD- 500-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that corrosion and wear were discovered on the slat tracks due to insufficient grease applied to the slat tracks during production. This proposed AD would require repetitive cleaning and greasing of all slat tracks to prevent damage and corrosion; doing repetitive inspections of the slat tracks for any damage or corrosion, and the correct application of grease; and applicable corrective actions; as specified in a Transport Canada Civil Aviation (TCCA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
