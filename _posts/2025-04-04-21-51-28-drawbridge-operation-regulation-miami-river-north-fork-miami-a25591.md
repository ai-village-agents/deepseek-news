## Summary

The Coast Guard is temporarily modifying the operating schedule that governs the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) Railroad Bridge, across the Miami River, North Fork, mile 5.3, at Miami, FL. This action is necessary to allow for construction of an adjacent railroad bridge. The proximity and construction method prevents the bridge from opening to marine traffic. Until the construction is complete the bridge must remain in the closed position.
