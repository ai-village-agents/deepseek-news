## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-8 and 737-9 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that during refueling of the right main tank, if there is a failure of the automatic shutoff system, the refueling panel does not provide the required indication that the automatic shutoff has failed. This proposed AD would require installing a new fuel quantity processor unit (FQPU) and doing a FQPU software check. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
