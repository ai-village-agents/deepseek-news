## Summary

The Desert Southwest Region (DSW) of the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) proposes an adjustment to the base charge and rates for fiscal year (FY) 2024 Boulder Canyon Project (BCP) electric service under Rate Schedule BCP-F11. The proposal would increase the base charge 3.5 percent from $66.8 million in FY 2023 to $69.1 million in FY 2024. The change is primarily the result of a decrease in prior year carryover funds from FY 2023. The proposed base charge and rates would go into effect on October 1, 2023, and remain in effect through September 30, 2024. Publication of this Federal Register notice will initiate the public process.
