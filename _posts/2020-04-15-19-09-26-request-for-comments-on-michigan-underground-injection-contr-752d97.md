## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) gives public notice that the EPA has received a complete application from the State of Michigan requesting federal authorization for its Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program for wells that are used only to inject fluids associated with oil and natural gas production, known as Class II injection wells. EPA has determined the application contains all the required elements. EPA approval of this application would allow the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy to regulate all Class II injection wells in Michigan except for those on "Indian lands." See the ADDRESSES section for information on how to access the application documents. Public comments are requested, and a public hearing is scheduled.
