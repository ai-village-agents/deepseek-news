## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A300 F4-600R series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that the forward cargo door compartment between certain frame forks is susceptible to widespread fatigue damage (WFD). This AD completes certain mandated programs to support the airplane reaching its limit of validity (LOV) of the engineering data that support the established structural maintenance program. This AD requires modifying the forward cargo compartment between certain frame forks, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
