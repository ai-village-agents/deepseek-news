## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 757 airplanes and Model 767-200, -300, and - 300F series airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of excessively high flight deck or cabin temperatures. This AD requires revising certificate limitations and operating procedures of the existing airplane flight manual (AFM), to provide the flightcrew with procedures for hot flight deck or cabin temperatures to follow under certain conditions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
