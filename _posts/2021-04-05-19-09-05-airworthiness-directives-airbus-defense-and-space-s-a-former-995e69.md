## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-19- 25, which applied to all Airbus Defense and Space S.A. Model CN-235, CN-235-100, CN-235-200, and CN-235-300 airplanes; and Model C-295 airplanes. AD 2017-19-25 required repetitive inspections and operational checks of the affected fuel valves, and corrective actions if necessary. This AD continues to require repetitive inspections and operational checks of the affected fuel valves, and corrective actions if necessary, and also limits the installation of affected parts to those that are maintained in accordance with certain instructions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is incorporated by reference. This AD was prompted by a determination that it is necessary to limit the installation of affected parts specified in AD 2017-19-25 to those parts that are maintained in accordance with certain instructions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
