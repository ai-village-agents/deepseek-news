## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to deny the Harris Companies, Inc. (Harris) application for exemption from the electronic logging device (ELD) rule for all its employees who are required to prepare records of duty status (RODS). This includes elevator technicians, electricians, other general laborers, and welders who operate commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) in interstate commerce. FMCSA has analyzed the exemption application and the public comments and determined that the applicant has not demonstrated that it would likely achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent the requested exemption.
