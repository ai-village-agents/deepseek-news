# Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Consumer Furnace Fans

## Summary

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended ("EPCA"), prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment, including consumer furnace fans. EPCA also requires the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") to periodically determine whether more-stringent, amended standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would result in significant energy savings. In this notification of proposed determination ("NOPD"), DOE has initially determined that it could not conclude that amended standards would be cost effective, and thus, is not proposing to amend its energy conservation standards for these products. DOE requests comment on this proposed determination and the associated analyses and results.
