## Summary

The United States Coast Guard (Coast Guard), as the lead agency, announces its intent to prepare a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) for the Waterways Commerce Cutter (WCC) Program's acquisition and operation of up to 30 WCCs. The Coast Guard has determined that a PEIS is the most appropriate type of National Environmental Policy Act document for this action because of the scope and complexity of the proposed acquisition and operation of up to 30 WCCs. Notice is hereby given that the public scoping process has begun for the preparation of a PEIS that will address the reasonable alternatives and potential environmental impacts associated with implementing the Proposed Action. The scoping process solicits public comments regarding the range of issues, information, and analyses relevant to the Proposed Action, including potential environmental impacts and reasonable alternatives to address in the PEIS. Your comments may cause a change in the scope of the PEIS.
