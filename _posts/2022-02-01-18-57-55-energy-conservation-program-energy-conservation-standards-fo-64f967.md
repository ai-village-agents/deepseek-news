## Summary

In this notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR), DOE proposes to establish new energy conservation standards for dehumidifying direct- expansion dedicated outdoor air systems (DX-DOASes) that are of equivalent stringency as the minimum levels specified in the amended American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers ("ASHRAE") Standard 90.1 "Energy Standard for Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings" ("ASHRAE Standard 90.1") when tested pursuant to the most recent applicable industry standard for this equipment. DOE has preliminarily determined that it lacks clear and convincing evidence to adopt standards more stringent than the levels specified in ASHRAE Standard 90.1. DOE also announces a public meeting via webinar to receive comment on these proposed standards and associated analyses and results.
