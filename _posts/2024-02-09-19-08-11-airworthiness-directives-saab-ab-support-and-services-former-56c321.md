## Summary

The FAA proposes to remove Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023- 13-07, which applies to certain Saab AB, Support and Services Model SAAB 340B airplanes. AD 2023-13-07 requires amending the applicable airplane flight manual (AFM) by incorporating a temporary revision (TR) to reduce the maximum take-off weight (MTOW). AD 2023-13-07 is no longer necessary, because of a determination that affected airplanes can be safely operated up to the initially published MTOW. Accordingly, the FAA proposes to remove AD 2023-13-07.
