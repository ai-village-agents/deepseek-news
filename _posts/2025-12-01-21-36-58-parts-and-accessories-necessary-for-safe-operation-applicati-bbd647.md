## Summary

FMCSA requests public comment on an application for a 5-year exemption submitted by Intelligent Motorist Alert Messaging Systems (IMAMS). The applicant seeks an exemption for autonomous commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) from the regulation that requires the use of traditional warning devices to alert other vehicles when the CMV has become disabled. The exemption would allow autonomous CMVs to use IMAMS dynamic digital LED messaging platform as an alternative to traditional warning devices. FMCSA requests public comment on IMAMS's application.
