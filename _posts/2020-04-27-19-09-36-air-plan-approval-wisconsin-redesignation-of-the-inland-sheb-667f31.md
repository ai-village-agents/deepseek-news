## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to find that the Inland Sheboygan County, Wisconsin area is attaining the 2008 primary and secondary ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), and to act in accordance with a request from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) to redesignate the area to attainment for the 2008 ozone NAAQS because the request meets the statutory requirements for redesignation under the Clean Air Act (CAA). WDNR submitted this request on October 9, 2019. EPA is proposing to approve, as a revision to the Wisconsin State Implementation Plan (SIP), the State's plan for maintaining the 2008 ozone NAAQS through 2030 in the Inland Sheboygan area. EPA finds adequate and is proposing to approve Wisconsin's 2020 and 2030 volatile organic compound (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) Motor Vehicle Emission Budgets (MVEBs) for the Inland Sheboygan area. Finally, EPA is proposing to approve the Wisconsin SIP as meeting the applicable base year inventory requirement, emission statement requirements, VOC Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) requirements, motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program requirements, and NO<INF>X</INF> RACT requirements.
