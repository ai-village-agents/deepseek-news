## Summary

This order extends the duration of the withdrawal created by Public Land Order (PLO) No. 7625 for an additional 20-year period. On February 17, 2005, PLO No. 7625 withdrew 140 acres of National Forest System Lands in Lincoln County, New Mexico, from location and entry under the United States mining laws, subject to valid existing rights, to protect the Gallinas Peak and West Turkey Cone Electronic Sites for a period of 20 years. The land description in PLO No. 7625 was updated to align with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Cadastral Survey's current standards for land description specifications. The withdrawal's location, footprint, and acreage remain unchanged.
