## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the Illinois State Implementation Plan (SIP) to meet the base year emissions inventory, reasonable further progress (RFP), RFP contingency measures, and motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA) for the Illinois portion of the Chicago-Naperville, Illinois-Indiana-Wisconsin area (Chicago area) for the 2008 ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS or standard). EPA is also proposing to approve the 2017 transportation conformity motor vehicle emissions budgets (MVEBs) for the Illinois portion of the Chicago area for the 2008 ozone NAAQS. EPA is proposing to approve the state's submission as a SIP revision pursuant to section 110 and part D of the CAA and EPA's regulations because it satisfies the emissions inventory, RFP, RFP contingency measures, I/M, and transportation conformity requirements for areas classified as moderate nonattainment for the 2008 ozone NAAQS. Final approval of the Illinois SIP as meeting the I/M and RFP requirements of the CAA for the 2008 ozone NAAQS will permanently stop the Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) clocks for those specific elements, which were triggered by EPA's December 11, 2017 finding that Illinois failed to submit certain required SIP elements for the 2008 ozone NAAQS.
