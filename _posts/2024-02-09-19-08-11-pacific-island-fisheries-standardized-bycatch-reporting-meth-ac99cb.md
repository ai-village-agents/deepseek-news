## Summary

NMFS announces that the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) proposes to amend the five fishery ecosystem plans (FEP) for fisheries in the Pacific Islands Region. If approved, the FEPs would be amended to update data collection mechanisms identified as standardized bycatch reporting methodologies (SBRM) as needed, and revise descriptions of SBRM for consistency with current NMFS regulations. The proposed action considers the best available scientific, commercial, and other information about the fisheries, and supports the long-term sustainability of fishery resources.
