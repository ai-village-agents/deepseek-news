## Summary

The Farm Service Agency (FSA) is issuing this notice announcing ERP. ERP will provide assistance to producers for losses to crops, trees, bushes, and vines due to wildfires, hurricanes, floods, derechos, excessive heat, winter storms, freeze (including a polar vortex), smoke exposure, excessive moisture, qualifying drought, and related conditions occurring in calendar years 2020 and 2021. ERP assistance will be provided in two phases. This document provides the eligibility requirements, application process, and payment calculations for ERP Phase 1, which will provide payments for crop production losses and tree, bush, and vine losses calculated using certain data from previously issued crop insurance indemnities and Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) payments.
