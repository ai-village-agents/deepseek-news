## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. This SIP revision addresses Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements for the enactment of a Basic vehicle emissions inspection and maintenance (I/M) program for the five counties comprising the Pennsylvania portion of the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA- NJ-MD-DE Moderate nonattainment area (Philadelphia nonattainment area) for the 2015 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). The SIP revision demonstrates that Pennsylvania's existing I/M program in the Philadelphia nonattainment area meets applicable requirements for a Basic I/M program. The EPA is approving this SIP revision to the Pennsylvania SIP in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
