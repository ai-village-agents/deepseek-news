## Summary

In accordance with the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended, Sapazi Holdings, LLC and TDB Resources LP filed a timely petition for reinstatement of oil and gas lease NDMT105396602 (NDM 105578) for land in Williams County, North Dakota. The petition was accompanied by all required rentals and royalties accruing from September 1, 2021, the date of termination. No leases were issued that affect these lands. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) proposes to reinstate this lease because it meets the requirements of the Mineral Leasing Act and BLM regulations and conforms with the existing resource management plan.
