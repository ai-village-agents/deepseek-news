## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled "Cyclosporiasis National Hypothesis Generating Questionnaire". The Cyclosporiasis National Hypothesis Generating Questionnaire (CNHGQ) facilitates the collection of standard data during investigations of outbreaks of cyclosporiasis, thereby increasing the likelihood that outbreaks will be recognized and sources will be identified.
