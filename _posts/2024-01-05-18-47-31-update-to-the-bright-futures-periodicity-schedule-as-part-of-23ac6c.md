## Summary

A Federal Register notice published on October 24, 2023, detailed and sought public comment on recommendations under development by the Infant, Child, and Adolescent Preventive Services (ICAPS) Program, regarding updates to the HRSA-supported preventive services guidelines for infants, children, and adolescents in the Bright Futures Periodicity Schedule footnotes. The proposed updates are related to six existing footnotes. The ICAPS Program convenes health professionals to develop draft recommendations for HRSA's consideration. Twenty-five respondents provided comments which were received and considered as detailed below. On December 29, 2023, HRSA accepted as final the ICAPS Program's recommended update to the six footnotes. None of the footnote updates change the HRSA-supported clinical recommendations and therefore none of these updates make any changes to coverage without cost-sharing, as each of the footnotes merely update references to the supporting evidence base for existing recommendations or adds additional descriptive text. Please see https://mchb.hrsa.gov/programs-impact/bright-futures for additional information.
