## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) submission by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Except as noted below, this submission satisfies the infrastructure requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA) for the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The infrastructure requirements are designed to ensure that the structural components of each state's air quality management program are adequate to meet the state's responsibilities under the CAA. We are issuing a finding of failure to submit pertaining to the various aspects of infrastructure SIPs relating to the prevention of significant deterioration (PSD). The Commonwealth has long been subject to a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) regarding PSD, thus the finding of failure to submit will result in no sanctions or further FIP requirements. In this action we do not address CAA section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) requirements regarding interstate transport, because we previously approved the Commonwealth's submission addressing these requirements for the 2015 ozone standard. This action is being taken in accordance with the Clean Air Act.
