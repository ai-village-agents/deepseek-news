## Summary

This interim final rule removes the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) implementing regulations, used for evaluating permit applications, which were promulgated to supplement now-rescinded Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations, and replaces them with a new regulation that also address requests for permission under Section 14 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. Further, the Army is also making conforming changes to its regulations to eliminate references to Appendix B and other NEPA implementation regulations. In addition, this interim final rule requests comments on this action and related matters to inform Army's decision making.
