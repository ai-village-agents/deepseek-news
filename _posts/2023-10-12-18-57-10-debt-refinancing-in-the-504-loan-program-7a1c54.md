## Summary

SBA is adopting with changes the interim final rule published in the Federal Register on July 29, 2021. That interim final rule implemented section 328 of the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act, which modified the requirements for refinancing debt in the 504 Loan Program, as set forth in section 521(a) of title V of division E of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 and section 502(7) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. The modifications included: increasing the amount of existing indebtedness that may be refinanced for 504 debt refinancing involving expansions; and for 504 debt refinancing not involving expansions, removing two limitations on the program, reinstating an alternate job retention standard for the refinancing project, revising the definition of qualified debt, and removing the prohibition against Certified Development Companies (CDCs) participating in the Premier Certified Lenders Program using their delegated authority to make these loans.
