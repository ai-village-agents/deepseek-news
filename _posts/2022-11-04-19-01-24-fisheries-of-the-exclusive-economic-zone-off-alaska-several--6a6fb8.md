NMFS apportions amounts of the non-specified reserve to the initial total allowable catch (ITAC) of Bering Sea (BS) "other rockfish," BS Pacific ocean perch, BS sablefish, and Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) skates. This action is necessary to allow the fisheries to continue operating. It is intended to promote the goals and objectives of the fishery management plan for the BSAI management area.
