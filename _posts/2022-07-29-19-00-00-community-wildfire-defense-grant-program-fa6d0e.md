## Summary

U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service announces the availability of up to $1 billion in grant funding, appropriated under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, for the establishment of the Community Wildfire Defense Grant (CDWG) Program. As authorized under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, funds will be made available and distributed to eligible applicants within the footprints of the Western States, Northeast-Midwest States, Southern States, and Indian Tribes/Alaska Native Corporations. There are two primary project types for which the CDWG provides funding: the development and revising of Community Wildfire Protection Plans (CWPP) and the implementation of projects described in a CWPP that is less than ten years old. The Act prioritizes at-risk communities that are in an area identified as having high or very high wildfire hazard potential, are low-income, and/or have been impacted by a severe disaster.
