## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Fire Fighter Fatality Investigation and Prevention Program (FFFIPP) Survey. This data collection will evaluate fire department implementation of the NIOSH FFFIPP recommendations, and assess whether NIOSH FFFIPP recommendations are utilized by fire departments to identify barriers to implementation of recommendations and to identify areas for potential intervention projects.
