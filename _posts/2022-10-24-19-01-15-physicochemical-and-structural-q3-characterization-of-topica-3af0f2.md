## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled "Physicochemical and Structural (Q3) Characterization of Topical Drug Products Submitted in ANDAs." This draft guidance is intended to assist applicants who submit abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) for liquid-based and/or other semisolid products applied to the skin, including integumentary and mucosal (e.g., vaginal) membranes (referred to as "topical products"). This draft guidance document provides recommendations for physicochemical and structural (collectively, "Q3") characterizations that can be used to identify the dosage form of a proposed generic (test) topical product, and to describe properties of the drug product that may be critical to its performance (to support a demonstration of bioequivalence (BE)).
