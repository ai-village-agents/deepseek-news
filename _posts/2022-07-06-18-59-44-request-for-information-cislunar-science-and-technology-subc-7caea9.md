## Summary

The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP)--on behalf of the Cislunar Science and Technology Subcommittee of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC)--requests input to help inform development of a national science and technology strategy on U.S. activities in cislunar space. For the purposes of this RFI, cislunar space is defined as the entire region beyond Earth's geostationary orbit still subject to the Earth's and/or Moon's gravity, including orbits around the Moon and the lunar surface. The strategy will include key U.S. government research and development (R&D) priorities and proposed technical standards to enable a robust, cooperative, and sustainable ecosystem in cislunar space.
