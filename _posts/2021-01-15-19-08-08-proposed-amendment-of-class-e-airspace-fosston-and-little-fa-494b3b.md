## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Fosston Municipal Airport- Anderson Field, Fosston, MN, and Little Falls/Morrison County Airport- Lindbergh Field, Little Falls, MN. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of airspace reviews caused by the decommissioning of the Fosston and Little Falls non-federal non-directional beacons (NDBs). The names and geographic coordinates of the airports would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
