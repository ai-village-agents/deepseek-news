## Summary

In accordance with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Final Programmatic Damage Assessment and Restoration Plan and Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (Final PDARP/PEIS), and Consent Decree, the Federal and State natural resource trustee agencies for the Florida Trustee Implementation Group (Florida TIG) have approved the Final Phase V.4 Restoration Plan and Supplemental Environmental Assessment (Final Phase V.4 RP/SEA) and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI). In the Final Phase V.4 RP/SEA, the FL TIG selects to fund the fourth phase of the Florida Coastal Access Project through acquisition of the Dickerson Bay parcel: a 114-acre undeveloped coastal inholding in Wakulla County, Florida, within the approved boundary of St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge (NWR). This acquisition will continue the process of restoring natural resources and services injured or lost resulting from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010. The purpose of this notice is to inform the public of the availability of the Final Phase V.4 RP/SEA and FONSI.
