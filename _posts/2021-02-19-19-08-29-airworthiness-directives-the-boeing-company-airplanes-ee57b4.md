## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. This AD requires repetitive general visual inspections of the bilge barriers located in the forward and aft cargo compartments for disengaged or damaged decompression panels, reinstallation of disengaged but undamaged decompression panels, and replacement of damaged decompression panels. This AD was prompted by reports of multiple incidents of torn decompression panels being found in the bilge area. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
