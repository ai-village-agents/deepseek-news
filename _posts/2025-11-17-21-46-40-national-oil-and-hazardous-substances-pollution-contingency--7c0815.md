## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking interim final action to revise the transition date in recent amendments to the requirements in Subpart J of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) that governs the use of dispersants, other chemicals, and other spill mitigating substances when responding to oil discharges into jurisdictional waters of the United States. Specifically, the EPA is revising the date until which products listed on the current NCP Product Schedule will remain conditionally listed and available for use from December 12, 2025, to June 10, 2026, for certain agent categories for which there are no new products listed as of December 12, 2025, in accordance with recently amended testing and listing criteria. This rule will become effective immediately while the Agency seeks comments on this targeted revision to the new NCP Product Schedule transition date. EPA will respond and update this interim final action as appropriate.
