## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Region 9 is publishing this notice of availability of its final general NPDES permit (Permit No. NNG990001) for water discharges from facilities classified as low threat located in the Navajo Nation. Use of a general NPDES permit in the location described above allows EPA and dischargers to allocate resources in a more efficient manner, obtain timely permit coverage, and avoid issuing resource intensive individual permits to each facility, while simultaneously providing greater certainty and efficiency to the regulated community while ensuring consistent permit conditions for comparable facilities.
