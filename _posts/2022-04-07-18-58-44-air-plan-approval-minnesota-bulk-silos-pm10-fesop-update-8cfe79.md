## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a site- specific revision to the Minnesota State Implementation Plan (SIP) for particulate matter less than 10 microns (PM<INF>10</INF>) for the portland cement distribution terminal owned and operated by Bulk Silos, LLC (Bulk Silos), formerly known as Lafarge North America Corporation on Childs Road Terminal (Lafarge-Childs Road Terminal), located in Saint Paul, Ramsey County, Minnesota. In its June 16, 2021, submittal, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) requested that EPA approve certain conditions contained in Bulk Silos' federally enforceable state operating permit (FESOP) into the Minnesota PM SIP. The request is approvable because it satisfies the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA). MPCA's submission included an updated modeling demonstration to show the construction changes incorporated in the title I SIP Conditions will not interfere with the ability to maintain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), as Bulk Silos' allowable PM<INF>10</INF> emissions limits will be decreased with this action.
