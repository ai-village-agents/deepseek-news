## Summary

Georgia has scheduled a Special General Election on November 3, 2020, to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Senator Johnny Isakson. Under Georgia law, a majority winner in a Special General Election is declared elected. Should no candidate achieve a majority vote, a Special Runoff Election will be held on January 5, 2021, between the top two vote-getters. Political committees participating in the Georgia special elections are required to file pre- and post- election reports. Filing deadlines for these reports are affected by whether one or two elections are held.
