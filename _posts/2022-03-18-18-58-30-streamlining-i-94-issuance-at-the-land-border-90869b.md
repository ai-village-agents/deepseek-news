## Summary

To increase efficiency, reduce operating costs, and streamline the admissions process, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is now issuing electronic Form I-94s (Arrival/Departure Record) at land ports of entry. The Form I-94 documents nonimmigrants' status in the United States, the approved length of stay, and departure information. CBP has automated the Form I-94 process for the majority of nonimmigrants arriving by air and sea. However, CBP previously issued paper Form I- 94s to nonimmigrants arriving by land. For land arrivals, CBP is no longer issuing paper forms to nonimmigrants upon arrival except in limited circumstances and upon nonimmigrant request if feasible. Nonimmigrants can access Form I-94s online or via mobile application.
