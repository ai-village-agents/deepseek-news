## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Dassault Aviation Model FALCON 7X airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of smoke in the flightdeck and loss of the right-hand (RH) primary display unit (PDU) and the secondary flight display (SFD). This proposed AD would require inspecting the two electrical power feeders for damage (deterioration), measuring the clearance between the two electrical power feeders and the forward lavatory bulkhead, and applicable corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
