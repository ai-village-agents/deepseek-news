## Summary

This document alerts the public that the FAA intends to initiate a rulemaking to address the exception from FAA's domestic, flag, and supplemental operations regulations for public charter operators. To inform this effort, the FAA seeks public comment, data, and other information regarding current and planned public charter flights operated under on-demand rules that appear indistinguishable from flights conducted by air carriers as supplemental or domestic operations. The FAA will review comments received in response to this document to evaluate the need for and, if necessary, scope of any rulemaking.
