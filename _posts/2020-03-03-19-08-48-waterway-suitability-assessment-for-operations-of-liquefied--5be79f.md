## Summary

We are requesting your comments on a Letter of Intent and Preliminary Waterway Suitability Assessment (WSA) we received from Martin Midstream Partners proposing to modify its existing Neches Terminal in Beaumont, Texas to handle additional liquefied hazardous gas (LHG). The terminal currently handles Ammonia which is classified as a LHG and the projects currently being evaluated would modify existing operations at the terminal by adding additional LHG products and increasing the number of LHG vessels from 24 ships per year to up to 350 LHG barge and ship visits per year. The additional LHG products include butane, propane, ethane, ethylene and propylene. The Coast Guard is notifying the public of this proposed increase in LHG marine traffic on the Sabine-Neches Waterway and is soliciting comments relevant to the Coast Guard's preparation of a Letter of Recommendation (LOR) for issuance to the federal, state, or local agency with jurisdiction over the proposed facility.
