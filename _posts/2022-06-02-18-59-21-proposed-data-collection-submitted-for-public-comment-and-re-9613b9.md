## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Artificial Stone Countertops: Exposures, Controls, Surveillance, & Translation. The purpose of the proposed data collection is to conduct a survey with artificial stone countertop fabrication facilities to better understand, work practices and controls related to respirable crystalline silica, barriers or facilitators to implementation of medical and exposure monitoring requirements, and to identify areas for potential intervention, as well as countertop fabrication facilities willing to participate in future NIOSH exposure and health research.
