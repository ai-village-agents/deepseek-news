## Summary

The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA or Agency) is proposing to amend its Enterprise Duty to Serve Underserved Markets regulation to add a definition of "colonia census tract," which would serve as a census tract-based proxy for a "colonia," and to amend the definition of "high-needs rural region" in the regulation by substituting "colonia census tract" for "colonia." The proposed rule would also revise the definition of "rural area" in the regulation to include all colonia census tracts regardless of their location. These changes would make activities by the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) (collectively, the Enterprises) in all colonia census tracts eligible for Duty to Serve credit. The intent of the changes is to facilitate the Enterprises' ability to operationalize their Duty to Serve activities and thereby help increase liquidity in these underserved communities.
