## Summary

The Corporation for National and Community Service, operating as AmeriCorps (AmeriCorps), proposes to adopt regulations to indemnify AmeriCorps employees who, because of conduct taken within the scope of employment with AmeriCorps, have a verdict, judgment, monetary award, or personal damages claim issued against them that is not otherwise covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act. These proposed regulations set out how AmeriCorps employees may request indemnification or settlement of a claim and the circumstances in which AmeriCorps may approve indemnification or settlement of a claim.
