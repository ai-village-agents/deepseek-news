## Summary

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO or Office) is amending the patent rules of practice to provide that the receipt date of correspondence officially submitted electronically by way of the USPTO patent electronic filing system is the date in the Eastern time zone of the United States (Eastern Time) when the USPTO received the correspondence rather than the date on which the correspondence is received at the correspondence address in Alexandria, Virginia. This change is necessary because the USPTO is expecting to provide servers for receiving electronic submissions in locations that are separate from the USPTO headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia. This change will ensure consistency and predictability with respect to correspondence receipt dates, as the date of receipt accorded to correspondence submitted electronically will not depend on the location of USPTO servers. The USPTO is also amending the patent rules of practice to make other clarifying changes regarding the receipt of electronic submissions, including providing a definition for Eastern Time. These changes harmonize the patent rules with the trademark rules and provide clarity regarding the date of receipt of electronic submissions.
