## Summary

The Coast Guard has issued a temporary deviation from the operating schedule that governs the California Department of Transportation Route 4 highway bridge, across Old River, mile 14.8, between Victoria Island and Byron Tract, California. The amount of vessel traffic transiting the bridge site does not warrant an open on signal requirement for this drawbridge. This deviation will test a change to the drawbridge operation schedule to determine whether a permanent change to the schedule is needed. The Coast Guard is seeking comments from the public regarding these proposed changes.
