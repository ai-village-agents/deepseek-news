## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bell Textron Canada Limited Model 505 helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of a crack on the mounting bracket on the oil cooler fan assembly housing. This AD requires a one-time visual inspection for cracks on the mounting bracket on the oil cooler fan assembly housing and modification of the mounting bracket. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
