## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing for public comment a draft regulatory guide (DG), DG-1389, "Alternative Radiological Source Terms for Evaluating Design Basis Accidents at Nuclear Power Reactors." This DG is proposed Revision 1 to Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.183 which describes a method that the NRC staff considers acceptable in complying with regulations for design basis accident dose consequence analysis using an Alternative Source Term. This guidance for light-water reactor (LWR) designs includes the scope, and documentation of associated analyses and evaluations; consideration of impacts on analyzed risk; and content of submittals.
