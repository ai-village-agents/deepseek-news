## Summary

NMFS proposes a rule to implement amendment 125 to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area (BSAI FMP). Amendment 125 would add a small vessel provision to the current BSAI Pacific cod jig sector in the A season, January 1 to April 30. Under this small vessel provision, catch from catcher vessels (CV) using hook-and-line or pot gear that are less than or equal to 55 feet (ft) (16.8 meters (m)) length overall (LOA) harvesting Pacific cod in the BSAI during the jig gear A season would accrue to the jig sector allocation. This action would provide stability and additional opportunities for some fishery participants and potential new entrants. It also advances the goals and objectives of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act), the BSAI FMP, and other applicable laws.
