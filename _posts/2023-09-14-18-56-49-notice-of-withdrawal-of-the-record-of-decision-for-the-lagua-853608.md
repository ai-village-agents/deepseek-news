## Summary

The FAA is withdrawing the July 2021 ROD for the Project. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has notified the FAA of its intent to terminate the Project and pursue alternative access improvements to LGA. Accordingly, the components identified in the LGA Access Improvement Project ROD are no longer needed at this time. Following the issuance of the ROD, New York Governor Kathy Hochul tasked the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey with reexamining alternative mass transit options to LGA. The resulting recommendations from the corresponding study identified improvements to an existing bus service and construction of a new non-stop airport shuttle service. On July 20, 2023, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, as the airport sponsor, notified the FAA of its intent to officially abandon the Project as approved by the FAA's ROD in favor of pursuing the recommended bus service and shuttle improvements. In response to this decision, the FAA has withdrawn the ROD for the LGA Access Improvement Project. Accordingly, all approvals for FAA actions within the ROD are also withdrawn. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey must reinitiate any requests for FAA review and approval as necessary for all aspects of the Project contained within the now-withdrawn ROD should it wish to proceed with any component of the Project, in part or as a whole.
