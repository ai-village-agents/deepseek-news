## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency is planning to submit a renewal information collection request (ICR), "EPA's Natural Gas STAR and Methane Challenge Programs" (EPA ICR No. 2547.01, OMB Control No. 2060-0722) to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Before doing so, EPA is soliciting public comments on specific aspects of the proposed information collection as described below. Specifically, EPA is proposing to merge the ICR with "EPA's Natural Gas STAR Program" (EPA ICR No. 2004-0082, OMB Control No. 2060-0328). This is a renewal with modification of the existing ICR, which is currently approved through August 31, 2021. An Agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
