This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Neurodevelopmental Extension for Community Health Outcomes (ECHO)program on Children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). The purpose of this information collection is to monitor and evaluate the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Neurodevelopmental Extension for Community Health Outcomes (ECHO) Program on Children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). The intent of the project is to improve practicing pediatrician capacity for identification and care of children with neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly prenatal exposure to alcohol, in the medical home.
