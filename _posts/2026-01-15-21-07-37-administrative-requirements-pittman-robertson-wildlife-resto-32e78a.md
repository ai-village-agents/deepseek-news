## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, made deregulatory actions pertaining to Federal financial assistance programs and subprograms authorized under the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act and the Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act to better serve the American public, streamline government operations, and increase efficiencies for recipients of our financial assistance programs. This final rule reflects recent legislation; aligns with the Office of Management and Budget's administrative rules for Federal financial assistance; aligns with other laws, standards, and administrative processes; responds to comments and feedback on our 2019 rulemaking action; and provides clarity to help ensure consistency in administering our financial assistance programs and subprograms across the Nation.
