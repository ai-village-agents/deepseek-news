## Summary

The FAA proposes to amend, restructure, and consolidate the falsification regulations presently located throughout title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations. This proposal would (1) harmonize inconsistencies among the various falsification regulations and associated sanctions; (2) consolidate all existing falsification regulations into a general rule that standardizes the existing falsification regulations; and (3) ensure that falsification-related conduct not addressed by pertinent current regulations would be covered under the general rule. In addition, this proposal would create a falsification prohibition applicable to the regulations governing Commercial Space Transportation.
