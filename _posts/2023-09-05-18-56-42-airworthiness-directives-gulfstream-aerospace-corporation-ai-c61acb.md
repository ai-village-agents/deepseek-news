## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-23-04, which applies to certain Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation Model GVII-G500 and GVII-G600 airplanes. AD 2020-23-04 requires revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) and airplane maintenance manual (AMM) to include information pertaining to the fuel boost pump. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-23-04, an inspection for a missing or misplaced impeller shaft key of suspect fuel boost pumps has been developed that would terminate the actions of AD 2020-23-04. This proposed AD would retain the requirements of AD 2020-23-04 and require inspecting affected fuel boost pumps for proper installation of the impeller shaft key, marking affected fuel boost pumps that pass that inspection, and replacing fuel boost pumps that fail. This proposed AD would also limit installation of affected fuel boost pumps. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
