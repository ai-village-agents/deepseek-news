## Summary

The Direct Final Rule would repeal approximately 21 rule provisions and rule parts, totaling 2,927 words and covering approximately 7 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations, that plainly no longer serve the public interest because they have sunset by operation of law; govern an expired event; regulate an obsolete technology; are no longer used in practice by the FCC or licensees; or are otherwise duplicative, outdated, or unnecessary. The Direct Final Rule would find prior notice and comment "unnecessary" under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) before repealing these rules, but elect to provide an opportunity for input on that assessment, with the identified rules automatically being repealed absent any significant adverse comments in response to this Direct Final Rule.
