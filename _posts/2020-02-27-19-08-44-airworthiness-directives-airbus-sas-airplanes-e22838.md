## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A321-211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of erroneous positioning of affected parts on the skin of the fuselage during the pre-drill phase, which could result in unwanted drill-starts. This AD requires inspections for the presence of unwanted drill-starts on affected parts, and an inspection for cracks and corrective action if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
