## Summary

These special conditions are issued for the Boeing Model 767- 300F series airplane. This airplane, as modified by Commercial Aircraft Interiors, LLC (CAI), will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport category airplanes. This design feature is a crew-rest compartment that is a one piece self-contained unit for installation in the forward position of the Class E cargo compartment. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
