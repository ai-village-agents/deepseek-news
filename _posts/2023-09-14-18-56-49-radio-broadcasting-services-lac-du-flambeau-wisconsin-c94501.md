## Summary

This document requests comments on a petition for rule making filed by L.D.F. Business Development Corp., the non-gaming wholly-owned business entity of the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians (LDF Tribe), proposing to amend the FM Table of Allotments, by allotting Channel 225A at Lac du Flambeau, Wisconsin, as a Tribal allotment and the community's first local service. A staff engineering analysis indicates that Channel 225A can be allotted to Lac du Flambeau, Wisconsin, consistent with the minimum distance separation requirements of the Commission's rules, with a site restriction of 12.1 km (7.5 miles) northwest of the community. The reference coordinates are 46-01-14 NL and 89-44-54 WL. Lac du Flambeau, Wisconsin is located within 320 kilometers (199 miles) of the U.S.-Canada border. Commission staff has requested Canadian concurrence.
