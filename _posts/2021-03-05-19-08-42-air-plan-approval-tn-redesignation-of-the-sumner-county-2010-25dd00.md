## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Tennessee, through the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC), on September 29, 2020, to redesignate the Sumner County, Tennessee unclassifiable area (hereinafter referred to as the "Sumner County Area" or "Area") to attainment/unclassifiable for the 2010 1-hour primary sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) national ambient air quality standard (hereinafter referred to as the "2010 SO<INF>2</INF> 1-hour NAAQS"). EPA now has sufficient information to determine that the Sumner County Area is attaining the 2010 1-hour SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS and, therefore, is proposing to approve the State's request and redesignate the Area to attainment/unclassifiable for the 2010 1-hour SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS.
