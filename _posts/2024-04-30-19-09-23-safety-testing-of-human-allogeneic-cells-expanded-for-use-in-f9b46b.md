## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a draft document entitled "Safety Testing of Human Allogeneic Cells Expanded for Use in Cell-Based Medical Products; Draft Guidance for Industry." Allogeneic cells of human origin may be expanded in culture to manufacture medical products consisting of live cells, inactivated cells, cell lysates, or other cell-based materials such as cell-derived particles. The draft guidance document provides sponsors of allogeneic cell-based medical products recommendations for determining the appropriate cell safety testing to support an investigational new drug application (IND) or a biologics license application (BLA). Cell safety testing should be based on a risk analysis that considers the expansion potential of the cells, the reagents that are used to expand the cells in culture, and the number of individuals the cell-based medical product is capable of treating.
