## Summary

Pursuant to the Wilderness Act of 1964, and in accordance with National Park Service (NPS) Management Policies 2006 (MP 2006), Section 6.2.1, the NPS has completed a Wilderness Eligibility Assessment to determine if lands within the North Rosillos (Harte Ranch) section of Big Bend National Park meet criteria indicating eligibility for preservation as wilderness. The NPS has concluded that 63,505 acres of the 67,135 acres assessed are found to be eligible for inclusion in the wilderness preservation system because they have wilderness criteria described in the Wilderness Act of 1964. This acreage represents 7.9% of the park's total 801,365 acres.
