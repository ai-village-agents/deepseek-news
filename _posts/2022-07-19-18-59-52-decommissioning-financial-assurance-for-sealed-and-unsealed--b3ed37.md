## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is correcting the notification published in the Federal Register on April 28, 2022, regarding a regulatory basis to support a rulemaking that would amend its regulations for decommissioning financial assurance for sealed and unsealed radioactive materials. This action is necessary to correct a publication issue with the regulatory basis. In the notification, the NRC solicited comments from the public, and the public comment period closed on June 27, 2022. The NRC has decided to reopen the public comment period to allow more time for members of the public to develop and submit their comments.
