## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves receiving and maintaining correspondence required to be sent to the FAA from pilots who have been involved in a drug or alcohol related motor vehicle action. The information to be collected will be used to and/or is necessary because the FAA is concerned about those airmen abusing or dependent on drugs or alcohol in regard to the safety of the National Airspace System. Correction is being submitted to correct the docket number, Respondents, and Frequency information.
