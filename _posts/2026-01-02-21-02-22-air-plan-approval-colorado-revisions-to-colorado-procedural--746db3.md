## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking direct final action to approve revisions to the Colorado State Implementation Plan (SIP) that were submitted by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) on May 20, 2022. CDPHE requested EPA approval of revisions to the Colorado's Procedural Rules and Common Provisions Regulation. The revised rules include non-substantive updates to rule language that are administrative in nature and were intended to provide for general cleanup and improved readability. The EPA is approving these SIP revisions because it has determined that they are in accordance with the requirements for SIP provisions under the Clean Air Act (CAA).
