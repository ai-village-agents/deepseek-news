## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the FAA invites public comments about our intention to request approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to renew an information collection. Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 139 establishes certification requirements for airports serving scheduled passenger-carrying operations of an air carrier operating aircraft configured for more than 9 passenger seats, as determined by the regulations under which the operation is conducted or the aircraft type certificate issued by a competent civil aviation authority; and unscheduled passenger-carrying operations of an air carrier operating aircraft configured for at least 31 passenger seats, as determined by the regulations under which the operation is conducted or the aircraft type certificate issued by a competent civil aviation authority. This part does not apply to: airports serving scheduled air carrier operations only by reason of being designated as an alternate airport; airports operated by the United States; airports located in the State of Alaska that serve only scheduled operations of small air carrier aircraft and do not serve scheduled or unscheduled operations of large air carrier aircraft; airports located in the State of Alaska during periods of time when not serving operations of large air carrier aircraft; or heliports.
