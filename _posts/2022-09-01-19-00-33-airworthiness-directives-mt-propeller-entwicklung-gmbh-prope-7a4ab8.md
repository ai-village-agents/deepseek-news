## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain MT-Propeller Entwicklung GmbH MTV-5-1-( ), MTV-9-( ), MTV-11-( ), MTV-12-( ), MTV-14-B, MTV-14-D, MTV-15-( ), MTV-16-( ), MTV-17-( ), MTV-18-( ), MTV-20-( ), and MTV-27-( ) variable pitch propellers. This AD was prompted by reports of certain propeller blade lag screws that were manufactured with an improper surface finish, which results in reduced fatigue strength of these lag screws. This AD requires replacement of certain propeller blade lag screws with parts eligible for installation. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
