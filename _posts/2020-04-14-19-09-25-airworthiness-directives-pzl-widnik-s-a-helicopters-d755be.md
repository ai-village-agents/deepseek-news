## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all PZL [Sacute]widnik S.A. Model PZL W-3A helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of a cracked nose landing gear (NLG) bellcrank assembly. This AD requires a one-time inspection of the NLG bellcrank assembly for discrepancies and replacement if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
