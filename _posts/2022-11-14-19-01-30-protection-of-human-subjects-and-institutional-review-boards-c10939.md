## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency) is extending the comment period for two proposed rules that appeared in the Federal Register of September 28, 2022. In the proposed rule entitled "Protection of Human Subjects and Institutional Review Boards," FDA requested comments on proposed changes to its regulations regarding obtaining and documenting informed consent from research participants, and institutional review board membership and functions, including continuing review (Docket No. FDA-2021-N-0286). In the proposed rule entitled "Institutional Review Boards; Cooperative Research," FDA requested comment on a change to its regulations that would require any institution located in the United States participating in FDA-regulated cooperative research to rely on approval by a single institutional review board (IRB) for that portion of the research that is conducted in the United States, with some exceptions (Docket No. FDA-2019-N-2175). The Agency is taking this action in response to requests for an extension to allow interested persons additional time to submit comments.
