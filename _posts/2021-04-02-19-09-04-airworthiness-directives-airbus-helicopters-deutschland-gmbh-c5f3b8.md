## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (AHD) Model MBB-BK 117 D-2 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a failed electrical test during production. This proposed AD would require replacing certain wire harness trim connector backshells (backshells), as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). This proposed AD would also prohibit installing the affected backshells. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
