## Summary

The FAA proposes to remove Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2016- 15-01, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A300 series airplanes; Model A300 B4-600, B4-600R, and F4-600R series airplanes, and Model A300 C4-605R Variant F airplanes (collectively called Model A300-600 series airplanes); and Model A310 series airplanes. AD 2016-15-01 requires an inspection to determine trimmable horizontal stabilizer actuator (THSA) part numbers, serial numbers, and flight cycles on certain THSAs; and repetitive replacement of certain THSAs. AD 2016-15- 01 is no longer necessary, because the FAA has issued AD 2022-25-12 to terminate AD 2016-15-01 for Model A310 series airplanes and an NPRM that would terminate AD 2016-15-01 for Model A300-600 series airplanes. The FAA has also determined that the inclusion of the Model A300 series airplanes in the applicability of AD 2016-15-01 was an inadvertent error. Accordingly, the FAA proposes to remove AD 2016-15-01.
