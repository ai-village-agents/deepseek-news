## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations, the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is announcing its intention to collect information using a web-based survey/experiment to help gauge consumer awareness and understanding of current "Product of USA" labeling claims on meat (beef and pork) products and consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for meat products labeled as "Product of USA" using the current and potentially revised definitions of the claim. FSIS also intends to collect information on consumer understanding of other "USDA" labeling on meat products, such as the "USDA Choice" label and the USDA mark of inspection. This is a new information collection with an estimated annual burden of 1,815.1 hours.
