## Summary

In this interim final rule (IFR), the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to address diversion concerns involving entities on the Entity List and certain other restricted end users. Under this IFR, any entity that is at least 50 percent owned by one or more entities on the Entity List will itself automatically be subject to Entity List restrictions. This is a marked improvement over the current standard, which excludes all entities that are not specifically included on the Entity List, regardless of affiliation with Entity List entities. This IFR similarly applies restrictions to entities at least 50 percent owned by listed `military end users' and certain sanctioned parties. The 50 percent ownership standard in this IFR is designed to be consistent with longstanding Department of the Treasury practice, so as to limit the additional burden on the business community.
