## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company (Boeing) Model 737-8, 737-8200, and 737-9 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of a missing washer and nut and consequent migrated bolt discovered by an operator during scheduled maintenance. This AD requires a one-time inspection of the aft rudder quadrant and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
