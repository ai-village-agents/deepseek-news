## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in response to a request under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended, from the United States Coast Guard, propose to authorize nonlethal, incidental take by harassment of small numbers of the Southeast Alaska stock of northern sea otters between July 1, 2022, and June 30, 2023. The applicant requested this authorization for take that may result from activities associated with a floating dock expansion project in the Tongass Narrows at the U.S. Coast Guard Base Ketchikan. We estimate that this project may result in the nonlethal incidental take of up to five northern sea otters from the Southeast Alaska stock. This proposed authorization, if finalized, will be for up to 35 takes of 5 northern sea otters by Level B harassment only. No injury or mortality is expected or will be authorized.
