## Summary

Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has determined not to review a final initial determination ("Final ID") issued by the presiding administrative law judge ("ALJ") finding a violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, with respect to U.S. Trademark Registration Nos. 4,811,656 ("the '656 mark") and 4,811,749 ("the '749 mark") by defaulting respondent Zhejiang Quingyou Electronic Commerce Co., Ltd. ("Zhejiang Quingyou") and with respect to the '749 mark by defaulting respondent Shenzhen Mediatek Tong Technology Co., Ltd. ("Mediatek").
