## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) adopts rules to facilitate the deployment of supplemental coverage from space (SCS) in an effort to serve several important public interest goals for the Nation and expand the reach of communications services, particularly emergency services, so that connectivity and assistance is available in more remote places. In this document, to allow satellite communications on spectrum previously allocated only to terrestrial services, the Commission modifies the United States Table of Frequency Allocations to authorize bi- directional, secondary mobile-satellite service operations in certain spectrum bands that have no primary, non-flexible-use legacy incumbents, Federal or non-Federal. For these bands, we authorize SCS only where one or more terrestrial licensees--together holding all licenses on the relevant channel throughout a defined geographically independent area--lease access to their spectrum rights to a participating satellite operator, whose license reflects these frequencies and the geographically independent area in which they will offer SCS. In recognition that this new offering has the potential to bring life-saving connectivity to remote areas, the Commission also applies interim 911 call and text routing requirements to ensure that help is available to those who need it today while we work toward enabling automatic location-based routing of all emergency communications whether or not there is a terrestrial connection available.
