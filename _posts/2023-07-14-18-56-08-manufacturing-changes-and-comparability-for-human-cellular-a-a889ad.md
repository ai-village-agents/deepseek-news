## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a draft document entitled "Manufacturing Changes and Comparability for Human Cellular and Gene Therapy Products; Draft Guidance for Industry." The management of manufacturing changes presents many challenges for human cellular therapy or gene therapy (CGT) products due to the complexity of these products. The draft guidance provides sponsors of Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) and applicants of Biologics License Applications (BLAs) for CGT products, with recommendations regarding product comparability and the management of manufacturing changes for investigational and licensed CGT products. The purpose of this draft guidance is to provide FDA's current thinking on management and reporting of manufacturing changes for CGT products based on a life-cycle approach, and comparability studies to assess the effect of manufacturing changes on product quality.
