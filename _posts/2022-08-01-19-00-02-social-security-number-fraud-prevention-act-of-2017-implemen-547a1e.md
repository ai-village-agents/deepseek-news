## Summary

This proposed rule would revise the NASA's regulations under the Privacy Act. The revisions would clarify and update the language of procedural requirements pertaining to the inclusion of Social Security Numbers (SSN) on documents that the Agency sends by mail. These revisions are necessary to implement the Social Security Number Fraud Prevention Act of 2017, which restricts the inclusion of SSNs on documents sent by mail by the Federal Government.
