## Summary

On April 19, 2023, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) solicited feedback on the preliminary proposed rule language and posed specific questions to stakeholders for a rulemaking on the reporting of nuclear medicine injection extravasations as medical events. The public comment period was originally scheduled to close on July 18, 2023. The NRC has decided to extend the public comment period to allow more time for members of the public to develop and submit their comments.
