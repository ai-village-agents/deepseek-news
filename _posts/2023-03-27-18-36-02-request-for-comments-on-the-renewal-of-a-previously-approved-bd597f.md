## Summary

The Maritime Administration (MARAD) invites public comments on our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The information collection OMB 2133-0530 (Requirements for Eligibility of U.S.-Flag Vessels of 100 Feet or Greater in Registered Length to Obtain a Fishery Endorsement) is necessary for MARAD to determine if a particular vessel is owned and controlled by United Sates citizens and is eligible to receive a fishery endorsement to its documentation. A minor change request to include privacy act statements for the collection of personally identifiable information will be added to the affidavits for this collection. We are required to publish this notice in the Federal Register by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. A 60-day Federal Register Notice soliciting comments on the following information collection was published on January 19, 2023 (Federal Register 3459, Vol. 88, No.12).
