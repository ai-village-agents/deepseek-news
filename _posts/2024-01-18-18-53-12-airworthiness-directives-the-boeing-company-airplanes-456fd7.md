## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-9 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of an in-flight departure of a mid cabin door plug, which resulted in a rapid decompression of the airplane. This AD prohibits further flight of affected airplanes, until the airplane is inspected and all applicable corrective actions have been performed. The FAA previously sent an emergency AD to all known U.S. owners and operators of these airplanes. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
