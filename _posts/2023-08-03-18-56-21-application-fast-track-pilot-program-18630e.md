## Summary

The Farm Service Agency (FSA) is announcing a pilot program called "Application Fast Track" that will expedite the processing of direct Operating Loans (OL) and Farm Ownership Loans (FO) to family farmers and ranchers if qualified. The Application Fast Track Pilot Program (AFT) provides an alternative underwriting process for applicants that meet certain financial benchmarks. AFT will be available in selected pilot office locations beginning August 7, 2023, and will be available in all locations nationwide beginning January 1, 2024. AFT will run through September 30, 2024. The Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (CONACT) authorizes pilot projects of limited scope and duration to evaluate processes and techniques to improve program efficiency and effectiveness.
