## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announces the availability of the Final Waste Incidental to Reprocessing Evaluation for Vitrified Low-Activity Waste and Secondary Wastes at the Hanford Site, Washington (Final WIR Evaluation) and associated Waste Incidental to Reprocessing Determination for Vitrified Low-Activity Waste and Secondary Wastes at the Hanford Site, Washington (WIR Determination). The WIR Determination documents DOE's determination that vitrified low-activity waste (VLAW) and secondary wastes generated by, or derived from, such vitrification using the direct feed low-activity waste (DFLAW) approach are wastes that are incidental to the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, are not high-level radioactive waste (HLW), and are to be managed as low-level radioactive waste (LLW), pursuant to DOE Order 435.1, Radioactive Waste Management, and DOE Manual 435.1-1, Radioactive Waste Management Manual. DOE consulted with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and considered comments from States, Tribal Nations, stakeholders and the public before preparing the Final WIR Evaluation and WIR Determination.
