## Summary

Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on December 5, 2022, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. of the Republic of Korea; Samsung Electronics America, Inc. of Ridgefield Park, New Jersey; Samsung Research America, Inc. of Mountain View, California; and Samsung International, Inc. of Chula Vista, California. On December 19, 2022, complainants filed a letter supplementing the complaint. The complaint alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of components for certain environmentally-protected LCD digital displays and products containing same by reason of the infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 7,948,575 ("the '575 patent"), U.S. Patent No. 8,111,348 ("the '348 patent"), U.S. Patent No. RE45,117 ("the '117 patent"), U.S. Patent No. 8,842,253 ("the '253 patent"), and U.S. Patent No. 8,223,311 ("the '311 patent"). The complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The complainants request that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a limited exclusion order and a cease and desist order.
