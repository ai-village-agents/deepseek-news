## Summary

The DoD announces the availability of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) as part of the environmental planning process for the O'Brien Road Access Modernization (ORAM) at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland (hereafter referred to as Fort Meade). The DoD proposes to implement the ORAM project, which would entail renovation and upgrade of inspection facilities, upgrade of access facilities, and corresponding roadway improvements for Mapes, O'Brien, Perimeter, and Venona Roads on Fort Meade. The purpose of the proposed project is to construct facilities and infrastructure to allow for increased capacity for required security processing of traffic and deliveries entering Fort Meade and the National Security Agency (NSA) campus. The need for the proposed project is to address inefficiencies with current infrastructure and capacity issues.
