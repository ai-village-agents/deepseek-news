## Summary

The Commission hereby gives notice of the institution of investigations and commencement of preliminary phase antidumping duty investigation Nos. 731-TA-1587-1590 (Preliminary) pursuant to the Tariff Act of 1930 ("the Act") to determine whether there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is materially injured or threatened with material injury, or the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded, by reason of imports of certain preserved mushrooms from France, Netherlands, Poland, and Spain, provided for in subheading 2003.10.01 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, that are alleged to be sold in the United States at less than fair value. Unless the Department of Commerce ("Commerce") extends the time for initiation, the Commission must reach a preliminary determination in antidumping duty investigations in 45 days, or in this case by May 16, 2022. The Commission's views must be transmitted to Commerce within five business days thereafter, or by May 23, 2022.
