## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering issuance of exemptions that would permit the Southern Nuclear Operating Company, Inc. (SNC, the licensee) to make changes to the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (Vogtle), Unit 1 and 2, licensing basis. Specifically, the licensee is seeking exemptions that would allow the use of both a risk-informed approach to address safety issues discussed in Generic Safety Issue (GSI)-191 and to close Generic Letter (GL) 2004-02. The NRC staff is issuing a final Environmental Assessment (EA) and final Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) associated with the proposed exemptions.
