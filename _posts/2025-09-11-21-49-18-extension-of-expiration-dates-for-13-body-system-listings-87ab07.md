## Summary

We are extending the expiration dates of the following body systems in the Listing of Impairments (listings) in our regulations: Low Birth Weight and Failure to Thrive, Musculoskeletal Disorders, Special Senses and Speech, Respiratory Disorders, Cardiovascular System, Genitourinary Disorders, Hematological Disorders, Endocrine Disorders, Congenital Disorders That Affect Multiple Body Systems, Neurological Disorders, Mental Disorders, Cancer (Malignant Neoplastic Diseases), and Immune System Disorders. We are making no other revisions to these body systems in this final rule. This extension ensures that we will continue to have the criteria we need to evaluate impairments in the affected body systems at step three of the sequential evaluation processes for initial claims and continuing disability reviews.
