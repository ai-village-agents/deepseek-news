## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by an updated stress analysis on the forward (FWD) cargo door and its attachment piano hinges that revealed a risk of cracking and crack propagation on piano hinges 2 and 3, originating from opening- closing fatigue cycles of the FWD cargo door. This AD requires an inspection of the affected parts, and applicable corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
