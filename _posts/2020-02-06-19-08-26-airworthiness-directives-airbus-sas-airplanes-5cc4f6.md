## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A319-112, A319-115, A319-132, A320-214, A320- 216, A320-232, A320-233, A320-251N, A320-271N, A321-211, A321-231, A321-232, A321-251N, and A321-253N airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of finding container/galley end stop bumpers damaged in service. This AD requires replacement of the affected bumpers with serviceable bumpers, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
