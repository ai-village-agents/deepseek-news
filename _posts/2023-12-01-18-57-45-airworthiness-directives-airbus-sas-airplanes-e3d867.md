## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-07- 05, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2019-07-05 required repetitive inspections for cracking of the 10VU rack fitting lugs and repair of any cracking. This AD continues to require the requirements of AD 2019-07-05, with reduced compliance times and removes airplanes having a certain modification from the applicability. This AD was prompted by a determination that certain repetitive inspection intervals need to be revised. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
