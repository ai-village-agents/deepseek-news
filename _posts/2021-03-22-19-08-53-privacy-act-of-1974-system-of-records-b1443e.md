## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to consolidate two current systems of records, "DHS/U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)-005 Trade Transparency Analysis and Research System of Records" and "DHS/ICE-016 FALCON Search and Analysis System of Records," into an overarching system of records titled, "DHS/ICE-018 Analytical Records." This new agency-wide system of records notice covers records maintained by ICE to allow personnel to search, aggregate, and visualize large volumes of information to enforce criminal, civil, and administrative laws under ICE's jurisdiction. Additionally, DHS is issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to exempt this system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act elsewhere in the Federal Register. This newly established system will be included in the Department's inventory of record systems.
