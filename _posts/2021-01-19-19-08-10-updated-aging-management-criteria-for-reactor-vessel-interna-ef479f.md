## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing Interim Staff Guidance (ISG) SLR-ISG-2021-01-PWRVI, "Updated Aging Management Criteria for Reactor Vessel Internal Components for Pressurized-Water Reactors." This ISG updates the aging management criteria for pressurized-water reactor (PWR) vessel internals components in the NRC's subsequent license renewal (SLR) guidance documents. Specifically, the ISG revises guidance contained in NUREG- 2191, "Generic Aging Lessons Learned for Subsequent License Renewal (GALL-SLR) Report," and NUREG-2192, "Standard Review Plan for Review of Subsequent License Renewal Applications for Nuclear Power Plants." This ISG is intended to facilitate preparation of SLR applications by clarifying existing guidance for aging management and adding new guidance, which also will facilitate the NRC staff's review of SLR applications.
