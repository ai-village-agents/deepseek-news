## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing a public meeting on the reauthorization of the Medical Device User Fee Amendments for fiscal years (FYs) 2023 through 2027 (MDUFA V). The current legislative authority for the medical device user fee program expires on October 1, 2022, and new legislation will be required for FDA to continue collecting user fees for the medical device program in future fiscal years. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) requires that before FDA begins negotiations with the regulated industry on MDUFA reauthorization, we publish a notice in the Federal Register requesting public input on the reauthorization, hold a public meeting at which the public may present its views on the reauthorization, provide a period of 30 days after the public meeting to obtain written comments from the public suggesting changes to MDUFA, and publish the comments on FDA's website. FDA invites public comment on the medical device user fee program and suggestions regarding the commitments FDA should propose for the next reauthorized program.
