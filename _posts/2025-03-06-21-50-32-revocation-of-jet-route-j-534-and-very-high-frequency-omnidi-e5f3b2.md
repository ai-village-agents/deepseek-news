# Revocation of Jet Route J-534 and Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal Airway V-349, Amendment of VOR Federal Airways V-23 and V-165 and Establishment of Canadian Area Navigation (RNAV) Route T-645 in Northwestern United States

## Summary

This action proposes to revoke Jet Route J-534 and Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal Airway V-349, amend VOR Federal Airways V-23 and V-165, and establish Canadian Area Navigation (RNAV) Route T-645 in the Northwestern United States. The FAA is proposing this action due to the pending decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Whatcom, WA, VOR/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) navigational aid (NAVAID). The VOR portion of the Whatcom VORTAC is being decommissioned in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program. There are two airways that use the naming convention of V-23. One is located in the state of Hawaii and the other is located in the state of California. This action proposes to affect the V-23 in the state of California and does not propose any changes to the V-23 in the state of Hawaii.
