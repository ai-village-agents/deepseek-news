## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to grant an exemption from the commercial driver's license (CDL) requirements to Navistar, Inc. (Navistar) for a commercial motor vehicle (CMV) driver, Mr. Anders Bj[ouml]rkman, employed as an engineer by Navistar's business partner Scania AB (Scania). Navistar and Scania are subsidiaries of Germany's TRATON SE. Mr. Bj[ouml]rkman holds a valid Swedish commercial license and wants to test drive Navistar CMVs on U.S. roads to better understand product requirements in "real world" environments and verify results. FMCSA reviewed Mr. Bj[ouml]rkman's commercial license records provided by Navistar, and believes the requirements for a Swedish commercial license, and the terms and conditions set forth below, including a Navistar-administered drug and alcohol testing program, will ensure that his operation under this exemption will likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to or greater than the level that would be obtained in the absence of the exemption.
