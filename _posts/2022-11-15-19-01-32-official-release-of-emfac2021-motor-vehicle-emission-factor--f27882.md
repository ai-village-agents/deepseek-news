## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving and announcing the availability of the latest version of the California EMFAC (short for EMission FACtor) model for use in state implementation plan (SIP) development and transportation conformity in California. EMFAC2021 is the latest update to the EMFAC model for use by California state and local governments to meet Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements. The new model, which is based on new and improved data and new and amended regulations in California, calculates air pollution emissions factors for passenger cars, trucks, motorcycles, motor homes, and buses. The EPA is also approving EMFAC2017 adjustment factors, which are based on these same new regulations, for those areas that have already begun SIP development with EMFAC2017. This notice also sets the date after which EMFAC2021, rather than EMFAC2017 or the EMFAC2017 adjustment factors discussed in this notice, must be used to satisfy the requirement that conformity determinations be based on the latest emissions model available. Because the EMFAC model is used only in California, this notice does not affect the applicability of the Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator (MOVES) model for users in other states.
