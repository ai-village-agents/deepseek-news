## Summary

The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) statute of the Public Health Services Act requires that RWHAP Part A, B, and C recipients expend 75 percent of Parts A, B, and C grant funds on core medical services for individuals with HIV/AIDS identified and eligible under the statute, after reserving statutory permissible amounts for administrative and clinical quality management costs. The statute also grants the Secretary authority to waive this requirement if certain requirements are met. HRSA is proposing to simplify the process for RWHAP Part A, B, and C recipients to request a waiver of the core medical services expenditure amount requirement by replacing HRSA Policy Number 13-07, "Uniform Standard for Waiver of Core Medical Services Requirement for Grantees Under Parts, A, B, and C" (accessible at the following link) https://hab.hrsa.gov/sites/default/ files/hab/Global/13-07waiver.pdf. This notice seeks to make public the proposed policy and provide an opportunity for public comment before its implementation. In a separate notice entitled, Updates to Uniform Standard for Waiver of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program Core Medical Services Expenditure Requirement, OMB No. 0906-XXXX-NEW, HRSA is inviting comments on the data collection changes associated with this proposed policy change.
