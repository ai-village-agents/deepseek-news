## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2013-07- 09, which applied to certain The Boeing Company Model 737-700, -700C, - 800, and -900ER series airplanes, Model 747-400F series airplanes, and Model 767-200 and -300 series airplanes. AD 2013-07-09 required a general visual inspection for affected serial numbers of the crew oxygen mask stowage box units, and replacement or re-identification as necessary. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2013-07-09 and expands the applicability. This AD was prompted by a determination that the affected parts may be installed on airplanes outside the original applicability of AD 2013-07-09. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
