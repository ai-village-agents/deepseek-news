## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited Model DHC-8-400 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that certain elevator power control unit (PCU) arm fittings have nonconforming fillet radii. This proposed AD would require an inspection for affected elevator PCU assemblies, inspections of affected elevator PCU arm fittings for nonconforming fillet radii and cracks, replacement if necessary, and re-identification of the affected elevator PCU assemblies. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
