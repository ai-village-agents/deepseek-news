## Summary

In this document, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) proposes to remove the existing non-federal secondary radiolocation and amateur allocations in the 3.3-3.55 GHz band and to relocate incumbent non-federal operations out of the band, in order to prepare the band for possible expanded commercial wireless use. Specifically, the NPRM would eliminate the non-federal radiolocation services allocation in the 3.3-3.55 GHz band and the non-federal amateur allocation in the 3.3-3.5 GHz band. This NPRM also seeks comment on appropriate relocation options for incumbent non-federal users, either to the 3.1- 3.3 GHz band or to other frequencies, on the transition mechanism and process for relocating existing non-federal users, and on potential relocation costs and considerations. The proposals in the NPRM are an initial step toward potential future shared use between federal operations and flexible use commercial services, consistent with the Commission's responsibilities specified in the MOBILE NOW Act to identify spectrum for new mobile and fixed wireless use and to work in consultation with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to evaluate the feasibility of allowing commercial wireless services to share use of spectrum between 3.1 and 3.55 GHz.
