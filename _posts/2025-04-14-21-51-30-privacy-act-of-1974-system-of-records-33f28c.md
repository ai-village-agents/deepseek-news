This system significantly expands the Department's ability to collect current data, historical data, interviews, and commentary, as well as digitize existing libraries of this data in a searchable format. The Department uses public affairs records (PA Records) for various purposes, including research, historical commentary, storm and disaster archives, and public affairs records documenting matters of significant public interest. The Department is committed to ensuring that any technology, including digitization of archival records, used to collect, use, retain, or disseminate information about individuals complies with the Constitution, Federal law, regulations, and policies.
