## Summary

The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is proposing to amend the existing Suspended Counterparty Program (SCP) regulation. FHFA proposes to expand the categories of covered misconduct on which a suspension could be based to include sanctions arising from certain forms of civil enforcement. The proposed rule would also eliminate the requirement that any final suspension order be preceded by a proposed suspension order, but only when the suspension is based on an administrative sanction.
