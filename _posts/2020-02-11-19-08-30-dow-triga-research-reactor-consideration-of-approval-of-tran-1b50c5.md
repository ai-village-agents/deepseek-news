## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) received and is considering approval of an application filed by the Dow Chemical Company (TDCC, the licensee) on November 22, 2019. The application seeks NRC approval of the indirect transfer of control of TDCC's interests in the Dow TRIGA Research Reactor (DTRR, the facility) Renewed Facility Operating License No. R-108 to Dow, Inc. The indirect transfer resulted from the merger of TDCC with E.I. du Pont De Nemours and Company in August 2017, which established a new parent company, DowDuPont, Inc. Subsequently, in April 2019, Dow, Inc. was formed as a separate company from DowDuPont, Inc. and TDCC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dow, Inc.
