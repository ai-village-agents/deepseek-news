## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2024-24-09, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A318 and A320 series airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, -133, - 151N, -153N, and -171N airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, -232, -251N, -251NX, -252N, -252NX, -253N, -253NX, - 271N, -271NX, -272N, and -272NX airplanes. AD 2024-24-09 requires the actions in AD 2022-24-05, provides optional terminating action for the repetitive inspections, revises the list of affected parts, and prohibits the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. Since the FAA issued AD 2024-24-09, the list of additional affected galley part numbers has been revised. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2024-24-09 and would revise the list of affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
