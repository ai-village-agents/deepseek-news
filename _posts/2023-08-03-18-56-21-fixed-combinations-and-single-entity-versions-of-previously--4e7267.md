## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled "Fixed- Combinations and Single-Entity Versions of Previously Approved Antiretrovirals for the Treatment or Prevention of HIV-1 Under PEPFAR." This draft guidance provides recommendations for applications for single-entity antiretroviral (ARV) and ARV fixed-combination (FC) drug products for the treatment or prevention of human immunodeficiency virus-one (HIV-1) infection that are intended for procurement under the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Specifically, this draft guidance addresses versions of ARV drug products for which the individual ARV drug product components are already FDA-approved and for which substantial evidence of safety and efficacy of the specific drug product or combination drug product already exists. When finalized, this draft guidance will replace the previous final guidance for industry entitled "Fixed Dose Combinations, Co-Packaged Drug Products, and Single-Entity Versions of Previously Approved Antiretrovirals for the Treatment of HIV" issued in October 2006.
