## Summary

As part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork burdens, and as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), the Surface Transportation Board (Board) gives notice of its intent to seek approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for an extension and modification of an existing and approved information collection, as described below. An emergency approval was granted for this collection (OMB Control Number 2140-0041), expiring on January 31, 2023. The Board is now seeking to extend and modify that collection with a submission through OMB's regular PRA clearance process.
