## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2014-11-02 for Airbus Helicopters Model SA-365N, SA-365N1, AS-365N2, and AS 365 N3 helicopters. AD 2014-11-02 requires repetitively inspecting frame number (No.) 9 for a crack. Since the FAA issued AD 2014-11-02, Airbus Helicopters developed a modification that would provide an optional terminating action for the repetitive inspections required by AD 2014-11-02. This proposed AD would retain the requirements of AD 2014-11-02, provide an optional terminating action for the repetitive inspections, and reduce the applicability by excluding certain post-modified helicopters. The actions of this proposed AD are intended to address an unsafe condition on these products.
