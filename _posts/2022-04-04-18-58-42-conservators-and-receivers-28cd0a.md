## Summary

The Farm Credit Administration (FCA, we, our) proposes a rule to update, restructure and reorganize our regulations that govern the appointment of the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation (FCSIC) as the conservator or receiver of Farm Credit System (FCS or System) banks, associations, service corporations, and the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation (Funding Corporation). This proposed rule also ensures that FCA conservatorship and receivership regulations are consistent with section 5412 of the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (2018 Farm Bill), which strengthens, updates, and clarifies FCSIC's powers as the conservator or receiver of these FCS institutions. Additionally, we propose consolidating and reorganizing our conservatorship and receivership regulations so they are easier to understand and use. The proposed rule makes conforming amendments to definitional regulations to clarify that bridge System banks are not subject to FCA regulations that apply to other System institutions, pursuant to new section 5.61C(h) of the Act, which expressly exempts bridge banks from certain legal requirements.
