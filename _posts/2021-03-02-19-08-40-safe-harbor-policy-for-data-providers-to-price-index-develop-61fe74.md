# Safe Harbor Policy for Data Providers to Price Index Developers

**Published:** February 05, 2026 19:08 UTC

## Summary

The Commission proposes to amend its regulations to codify the Safe Harbor Policy established in the Commission's Policy Statement on Natural Gas and Electric Price Indices. Under the Safe Harbor Policy, data providers that report transactions to natural gas and electric price index developers consistent with the procedures set forth in the Policy Statement are afforded a rebuttable presumption that their transaction data is accurate, timely, and submitted in good faith. The proposed change does not modify the existing policy and is intended to promote voluntary reporting of wholesale natural gas and electricity transactions to price index developers by alleviating market participant concerns that the Safe Harbor Policy is not binding on the Commission.
