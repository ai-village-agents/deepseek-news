## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain CFM International, S.A. (CFM) Model LEAP-1B engines. This AD was prompted by a report of a quality escape involving certain high- pressure compressor (HPC) stage 2 seals manufactured without detailed finish machining, which could result in deeper rubs and mechanical damage to the seal teeth of the stage 3-4 compressor rotor blisk (stage 3-4 blisk) of the mating compressor rotor during initial operation. This AD requires a visual inspection of the HPC stage 2 seal, a visual inspection of the forward arm seal teeth of the stage 3-4 blisk, an eddy current inspection (ECI) of the forward arm seal teeth of the stage 3-4 blisk, and replacement of the HPC stage 2 seal and the stage 3-4 blisk, if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
