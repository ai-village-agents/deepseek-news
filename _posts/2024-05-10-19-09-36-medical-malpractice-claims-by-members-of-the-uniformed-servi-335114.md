## Summary

The DoD is finalizing amendments to apply offsets for payments made by the U.S. Government for medical malpractice claims to potential economic damages only and not to total potential damages. Under this rule total potential damages will no longer be reduced by offsetting most of the compensation otherwise provided or expected to be provided by DoD or the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for the same harm that is the subject of the medical malpractice claim. Instead, only economic damages will be reduced by offsetting most of the compensation otherwise provided or expected to be provided by DoD or the VA for the same harm that is the subject of the medical malpractice claim. This rule also clarifies future lost earnings may be awarded until the time DoD determines that the claimant is, or is expected to be, medically rehabilitated and able to resume employment; in cases of permanent incapacitation, until expiration of the claimant's work-life expectancy; or, in cases of death, until the expiration of the claimant's work-life expectancy, after deducting for the claimant's personal consumption.
