## Summary

The Department of Labor's (Department or DOL) Employment and Training Administration (ETA) invites employers and other interested parties to comment on draft guidance, in the form of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), pertaining to the Office of Foreign Labor Certification's (OFLC) assessment of the nature of an employer's need for agricultural labor or services during the review of an H-2A Application for Temporary Employment Certification (H-2A application). ETA's OFLC developed this guidance, and is publishing it for public comment, consistent with a directive from the Secretary of Labor (Secretary) for interpretive guidance clarifying how the Department assesses an H-2A employer's need for agricultural labor or services to determine whether the employer has demonstrated a need of a temporary or seasonal nature, as required for certification. ETA invites the public to review the draft FAQs presented in this notice and provide written comments to OFLC, which will further inform the Department's development of guidance regarding OFLC's assessment of temporary or seasonal need for the H-2A program. The Department will publish this final guidance in the Federal Register.
