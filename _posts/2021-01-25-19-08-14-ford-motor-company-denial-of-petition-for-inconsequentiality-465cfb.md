## Summary

On July 10, 2017, Takata Corporation ("Takata") filed a defect information report ("DIR") in which it determined that a safety-related defect exists in phase-stabilized ammonium nitrate ("PSAN") driver-side air bag inflators that it manufactured with a calcium sulfate desiccant and supplied to Ford Motor Company ("Ford"), Mazda North American Operations ("Mazda"), and Nissan North America Inc. ("Nissan") for use in certain vehicles. Ford petitioned the Agency for a decision that the equipment defect determined to exist by Takata is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety in the Ford vehicles affected by Takata's DIR, and that Ford should therefore be relieved of its notification and remedy obligations under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 and its applicable regulations. After reviewing the petition, NHTSA has concluded that Ford has not met its burden of establishing that the defect is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety, and denies the petition.
