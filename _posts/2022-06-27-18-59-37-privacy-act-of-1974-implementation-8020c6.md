## Summary

The DoD is amending this part to remove the exemption rules associated with three systems of records notices (SORNs) established for the Department of the Air Force and two SORNs established for the Office of the Secretary of Defense under the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. Elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, the DoD is giving concurrent notice of the rescindment of these same five SORNs as part of a notice rescinding numerous other SORNs. The DoD is also amending this part to remove an exemption rule associated with one SORN established for the Marine Corps that was previously rescinded by the DoD. This rule is being published as a direct final rule as the Department does not expect to receive any adverse comments. If such comments are received, this direct final rule will be withdrawn and a proposed rule for comments will be published.
