## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain International Aero Engines AG (IAE AG) Model V2522-A5, V2524- A5, V2525-D5, V2527-A5, V2527E-A5, V2527M-A5, V2528-D5, V2530-A5, V2531-E5, and V2533-A5 engines. This AD was prompted by further analysis of an event involving an IAE AG Model V2533-A5 engine that had an uncontained failure of a high-pressure turbine (HPT) 1st-stage hub that resulted in high-energy debris penetrating the engine cowling. This AD requires revising the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the existing maintenance manual or instructions for continued airworthiness and the existing approved maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to include new inspections of certain critical rotating parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
