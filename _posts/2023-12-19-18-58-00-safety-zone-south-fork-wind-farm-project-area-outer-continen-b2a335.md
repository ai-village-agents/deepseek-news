## Summary

The Coast Guard is extending the effective period for the 13 temporary 500-meter temporary safety zones around the construction of 12 wind turbine generators (WTGs) and one offshore substation (OSS) located in the South Fork Wind Farm (SFWF) project area within Federal waters on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), specifically, in the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) Renewable Energy Lease Area OCS-A 0517, approximately 16 nautical miles (NM) southeast of Block Island, Rhode Island, and 30 NM east of Montauk Point, New York. This rule extends the effective period of the existing safety zones for an additional five months. The safety zones will now end on May 31, 2024. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life, property, and the environment during the anticipated construction of each facility's monopile type foundation and subsequent installation of the WTGs turbines and OSS platform. When enforced, only attending vessels and those vessels specifically authorized by the First Coast Guard District Commander or a designated representative are permitted to enter or remain in the safety zones.
