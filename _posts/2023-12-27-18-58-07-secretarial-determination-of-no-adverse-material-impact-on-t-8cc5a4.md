## Summary

On November 22, 2023, the Secretary of Energy issued a Secretarial Determination (hereafter "determination") covering the sale, lease, or transfer of up to 750 kilograms uranium (kgU) of high- assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) (above 5, but less than 20 weight percent (wt.-%) uranium-235) per year during the two-year period following signature of the determination to support molybdenum-99 (Mo- 99) production. For the reasons set forth in the Department's "Analysis of Potential Impacts of Certain Uranium Transactions on the Domestic Uranium Mining, Conversion, and Enrichment Industries," which is incorporated into the determination, the Secretary determined that these transactions will not have an adverse material impact on the domestic uranium mining, conversion, or enrichment industries.
