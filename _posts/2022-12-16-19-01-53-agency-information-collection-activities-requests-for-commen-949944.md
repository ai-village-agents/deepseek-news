In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves submission of Fatigue Risk Management Plans (FRMP) for flight attendants of certificate holders operating under Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 121. The certificate holders will submit the information to be collected to the FAA for review and acceptance as required by the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018.
