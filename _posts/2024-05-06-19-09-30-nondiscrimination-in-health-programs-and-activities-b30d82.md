## Summary

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS or the Department) is issuing this final rule regarding section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) (section 1557). Section 1557 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability in certain health programs and activities. Section 1557(c) of the ACA authorizes the Secretary of the Department to promulgate regulations to implement the nondiscrimination requirements of section 1557. The Department is also revising its interpretation regarding whether Medicare Part B constitutes Federal financial assistance for purposes of civil rights enforcement. Additionally, the Department is revising provisions prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex in regulations issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) governing Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP); Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE); health insurance issuers and their officials, employees, agents, and representatives; States and the Exchanges carrying out Exchange requirements; agents, brokers, or web-brokers that assist with or facilitate enrollment of qualified individuals, qualified employers, or qualified employees; issuers providing essential health benefits (EHB); and qualified health plan issuers.
