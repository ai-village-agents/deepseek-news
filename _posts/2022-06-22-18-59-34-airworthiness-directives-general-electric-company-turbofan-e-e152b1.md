# Airworthiness Directives; General Electric Company Turbofan Engines

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain General Electric Company (GE) GEnx-2B67/P model turbofan engines. This proposed AD was prompted by the detection of an iron inclusion in a forging, which may reduce the fatigue life of certain low-pressure turbine rotor (LPTR) stage 4 disks and LPTR stage 6 disks. This proposed AD would require the removal of certain LPTR stage 4 disks and LPTR stage 6 disks from service and replacement with parts eligible for installation. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
