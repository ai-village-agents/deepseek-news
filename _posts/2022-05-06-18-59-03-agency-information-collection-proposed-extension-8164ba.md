## Summary

EIA invites public comment on the proposed three-year extension, with changes, to the Petroleum Supply Reporting System (PSRS), as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The PSRS consists of six weekly surveys that make up the Weekly Petroleum Supply Reporting System (WPSRS), eight monthly surveys that make up the Monthly Petroleum Supply Reporting System (MPSRS), and one annual survey. EIA uses WPSRS surveys to collect data from a sample of operators on input, production, imports, and inventory levels of crude oil, hydrocarbon gas liquids, petroleum products, and biofuels. EIA uses MPSRS surveys to collect data from all in-scope operators on input, production, imports, biofuel feedstocks consumed, refinery capacity, biofuel plant production capacity, fuels consumed in plant operations, and annual storage capacity of crude oil, hydrocarbon gas liquids petroleum products, and biofuels. EIA uses annual Form EIA-820 to collect data on refinery capacity, refinery fuels and feedstocks consumed, and the quantity of crude oil received by method of transportation.
