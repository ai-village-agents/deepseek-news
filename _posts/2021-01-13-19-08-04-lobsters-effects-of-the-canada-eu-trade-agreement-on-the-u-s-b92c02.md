## Summary

Pursuant to a letter from the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) received on December 23, 2020, withdrawing his request of July 29, 2020 that the Commission conduct an investigation and prepare a report that details any negative effects of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between Canada and the European Union on the United States lobster industry, the Commission has terminated Investigation No. 332- 579: Lobsters: Effects of the Canada-EU Trade Agreement on the U.S. Industry, and will not release a report. The USTR requested the investigation and report under authority delegated by the President and pursuant to section 332(g) of the Tariff Act of 1930. In his letter withdrawing the request, the USTR stated that the European Union's recent removal of tariffs on imported lobsters eliminated the need for a report analyzing any disadvantages to the U.S. lobster industry caused by the prior agreement between Canada and the European Union.
