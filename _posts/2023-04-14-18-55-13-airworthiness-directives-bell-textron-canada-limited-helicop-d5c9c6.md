## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Bell Textron Canada Limited Model 206A, 206A-1 (OH-58A), 206B, 206B-1, 206L, 206L-1, 206L-3, and 206L-4 helicopters. This AD was prompted by a loss of tail rotor (TR) drive due to a failure of an adhesively bonded joint between an adapter and a tube on one of the segmented TR drive shaft (TRDS) assemblies. This AD requires determining if an affected TRDS is installed; repetitively inspecting the bond line for damage; repetitively performing a proof load test of the TRDS assembly; and depending on the results of the inspections or the proof load tests, removing an affected TRDS from service and replacing it with a serviceable TRDS. This AD also prohibits installing a TRDS unless it meets certain requirements, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
