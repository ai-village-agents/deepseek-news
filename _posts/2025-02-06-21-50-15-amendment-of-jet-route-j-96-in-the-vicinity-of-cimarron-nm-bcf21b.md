## Summary

This action proposes to remove a segment of Jet Route J-96 between the Cimarron, NM (CIM), Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR)/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) and the Garden City, KS (GCK), VORTAC navigational aids (NAVAID). The FAA is proposing this action due to the Cimarron VORTAC radials between 045[deg] and 055[deg], stated in degrees magnetic (M) north, that make up the route segment east of Cimarron, NM, being unusable since 2020.
