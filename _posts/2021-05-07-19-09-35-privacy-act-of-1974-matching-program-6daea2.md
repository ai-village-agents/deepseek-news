## Summary

This is an 18-month re-establishment computer matching agreement (CMA) with the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), regarding Veterans who are in receipt of drill pay and also in receipt of compensation or pension benefits. The purpose of this agreement is to verify eligibility for DoD/USCG members of the Reserve forces who receive VA disability compensation or pension to receive, in lieu and upon election, military pay and allowances when performing reserve duty. Veterans who perform reserve duty must choose the monetary benefit they prefer and waive the other. VA will use the DoD reserve military pay data in the VA-DoD Identity Repository (VADIR) to match against VA recipients of VA disability compensation or pension. DMDC sends reserve military pay data to VADIR monthly; the data provided by DMDC include all data elements required for the match. VA will use this information to make, where appropriate, necessary VA payment adjustments.
