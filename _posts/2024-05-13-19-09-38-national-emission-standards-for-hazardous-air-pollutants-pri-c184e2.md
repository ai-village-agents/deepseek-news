## Summary

This action finalizes the residual risk and technology review (RTR) conducted for the Primary Copper Smelting major source category regulated under national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP). This action also finalizes the technology review for the Primary Copper Smelting area source NESHAP. The final amendments for the major source NESHAP include particulate matter (PM) emission standards as a surrogate for metal hazardous air pollutants (HAP) other than mercury (primarily lead and arsenic) for anode refining point sources, process fugitive emissions from roofline vents, Hoboken converter process fugitive capture systems where they combine with anode refining point sources, and new converters. We are also finalizing emission standards for previously unregulated HAP including mercury, benzene, toluene, hydrogen chloride (HCl), chlorine, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and dioxins and furans (D/F). In addition, we are taking final action in the major source NESHAP to establish work practice standards for bypass stacks, and add a new emissions limit for lead and emissions control design standards to minimize process fugitive emissions at facilities with flash furnaces and Peirce-Smith converters. Final amendments for both the major source NESHAP and the area source NESHAP include removing exemptions and associated provisions for periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM), specifying that the emission standards apply at all times, and requiring electronic reporting of performance test results and notification of compliance reports.
