## Summary

HUD is removing the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as an approved index for adjustable interest rate mortgages (ARMs), and replacing LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as a Secretary-approved index for newly originated forward ARMs. HUD is also codifying its removal of LIBOR and approval of SOFR as an index for newly-originated Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM or reverse mortgage) ARMs. In addition, HUD is establishing a spread-adjusted SOFR index as the Secretary-approved replacement index to transition existing forward and HECM ARMs off LIBOR. HUD is also making clarifying changes to its HECM Monthly ARM regulation and establishing a lifetime adjustment cap for monthly adjustable rate HECMs. This final rule adopts HUD's October 19, 2022, proposed rule with minor changes.
