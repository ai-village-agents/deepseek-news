## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Airbus Helicopters Model EC120B helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of corrosion found on the external tail boom skin, under the Very High Frequency (VHF) antenna. This AD requires inspecting the tail boom at the VHF antenna attachments and depending on the results, repairing or modifying the tail boom skin, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
