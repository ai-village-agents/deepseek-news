## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, or the Agency) has approved the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE, or the Department) planned change request to dispose of defense transuranic (TRU) waste in replacement panels 11 and 12 in the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). This decision is based on a thorough review of information submitted by DOE, independent technical analyses, and public comments. EPA found that DOE demonstrated that the use of two replacement waste panels to replace lost waste disposal volume in panels 1, 7, and 9, would provide a reasonable expectation of the WIPP remaining in compliance with the 10,000-year release limits set by the "Environmental Standards for the Management and Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel, High-Level and Transuranic Radioactive Wastes" at 40 CFR part 191.
