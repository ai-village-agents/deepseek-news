# Analog Telecommunications Relay Service Modernization

## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) proposes to modernize its telecommunications relay services (TRS) rules and seeks comment on phasing out the mandatory status of traditional TTY-based relay services (TTY Relay) under state TRS programs; recognizing additional forms of internet-based TRS, such as internet Protocol Speech-to-Speech (IP STS) and real-time text (RTT)-based relay as compensable forms of TRS; establishing a temporary, national certification process for analog relay providers and user registration and verification requirements; and updating or eliminating obsolete rules to all forms of TRS. Through these proposals, the Commission aims to align TRS with today's communications landscape, better serve the needs of relay users, ensure the continued availability of TRS through the transition from legacy communications network, to modern, IP-based networks, and continue to protect the integrity of the TRS program through the prevention of waste, fraud, and abuse.
