Among the goal of supporting underserved communities is to advance housing justice and proactively strengthen and protect vulnerable and underserved communities. Through this Request for Information (RFI), the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) seeks public input regarding barriers to the origination of small mortgages in the FHA program. Information provided in response to this RFI will allow FHA to identify barriers to the origination of small mortgages in the FHA program and consider the development of policies and programs that better support and expand affordable homeownership opportunities in underserved markets with lower housing prices.
