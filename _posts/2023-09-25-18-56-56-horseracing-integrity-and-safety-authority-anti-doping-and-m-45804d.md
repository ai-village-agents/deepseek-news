## Summary

As required by the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act of 2020, the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC" or "Commission") publishes a proposed rule modification related to the equine Anti- Doping and Medication Control Program of the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority ("HISA" or the "Authority"). Specifically, the proposed rule modification would designate iron dextran as a banned substance and thereby prohibit its use. This publication contains the Authority's proposed rule's text and explanation, and it seeks public comment on whether the Commission should approve the proposed rule.
