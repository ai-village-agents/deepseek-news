## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of electronic centralized aircraft monitor (ECAM) messages requiring flight control remote module (FCRM) replacement linked to solder structural fatigue. This AD requires replacement of affected parts before exceeding the life limit and limits the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
