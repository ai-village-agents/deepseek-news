## Summary

This notice sets forth the reasons for the denial of a petition submitted on May 9, 2018, by Mr. J. Kevin Byrne (the petitioner) to NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation (ODI). The petition requests that the Agency "undertake a defects investigation" into "rust-related fuel tank detachment of Isuzu Rodeo fuel tanks." The petitioner bases his request upon a partial fuel tank detachment he experienced on his vehicle, a model year (MY) 2004 Isuzu Rodeo, and another complaint he found in NHTSA's online complaint database involving a MY 2001 Isuzu Rodeo. The petitioner also asserts that the partial fuel tank detachment is covered by NHTSA Recall Number 13V-547. On May 23, 2018, ODI opened Defect Petition (DP) 18-001 to evaluate the petitioner's concerns. After reviewing the information provided by the petitioner and field data regarding fuel tank detachment in MY 2001 through 2004 Isuzu Rodeos and similarly equipped vehicles, NHTSA has concluded that the issues raised by the petition do not warrant a defect investigation. Accordingly, the Agency has denied the petition.
