The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing a 15-day public comment period on the pool of twenty (20) candidates for the external peer review of the Biofuels and the Environment: Third Triennial Report to Congress (RtC3). The peer review will be conducted under the framework of EPA's Scientific Integrity Policy (https:// www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2014-02/documents/ scientific_integrity_policy_2012.pdf) and follow procedures established in EPA's Peer Review Handbook 4th Edition, 2015 (EPA/100/B-15/001). After consideration of public comments on the candidate pool, EPA's contractor, ERG, will select from this pool the final list of up to nine (9) peer reviewers, ensuring their combined expertise best spans the following disciplines: Economics, engineering, agronomics, land use change, remote sensing, air quality, biogeochemistry, water quality, hydrology, conservation biology, limnology, and ecology. This Federal Register notice (FRN) follows a previous FRN seeking nominations for the peer review panel published on February 1, 2022.
