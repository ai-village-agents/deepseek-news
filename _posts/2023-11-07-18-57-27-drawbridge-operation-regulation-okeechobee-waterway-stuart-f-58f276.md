## Summary

The Coast Guard is reopening the comment period to solicit additional comments concerning its notice of temporary deviation to the regulation governing the Florida East Coast (FEC) Railroad Bridge, across the Okeechobee Waterway (OWW), mile 7.41, at Stuart, FL. The expected increase in railway service was delayed and did not commence until late September 2023. Due to this delay, it was determined that we did not afford the public adequate opportunity to provide comments. We are reopening the comment period to allow the public more time to comment. The comment period is now open until November 30, 2023.
