## Summary

DoD is proposing to amend the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to further implement 41 U.S.C. 1908, Inflation adjustment of acquisition-related dollar thresholds. This statute requires an adjustment every five years of acquisition-related thresholds for inflation using the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers, except for the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute (Davis-Bacon Act), Service Contract Labor Standards statute, and trade agreements thresholds. DoD is also proposing to use the same methodology to adjust some nonstatutory DFARS acquisition-related thresholds in 2020.
