## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports that, under certain combinations of airplane configuration and flight conditions, higher than anticipated temperatures could lead to an engine fire warning nuisance message. This AD requires installation of Integrated Air Systems Controller (IASC) software version 5.0. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
