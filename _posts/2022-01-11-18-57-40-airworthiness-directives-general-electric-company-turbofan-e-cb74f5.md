## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain General Electric Company (GE) GE90 model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by two separate in-flight shutdowns (IFSDs) resulting from failure of the transfer gearbox (TGB) radial bevel gear (TGB radial gearshaft). This AD requires visual inspection of the TGB radial gearshaft and, depending on the results of the inspection, replacement of the TGB radial gearshaft. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
