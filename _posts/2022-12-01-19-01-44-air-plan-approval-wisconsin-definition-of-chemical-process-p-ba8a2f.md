## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) for Wisconsin and revisions to the title V Operating Permit Program for Wisconsin. The proposed revisions incorporate changes to the definition of "chemical process plants" under Wisconsin's Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and title V Operating Permit Programs. The changes to the state rules described below are approvable because they are consistent with EPA regulations governing state PSD and title V programs and will not interfere with any applicable requirement concerning attainment and reasonable further progress (as defined in section 171 of the Clean Air Act (CAA)), or any other applicable requirement of the CAA.
