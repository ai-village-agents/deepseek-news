## Summary

The Natural Resources Defense Council, Healthy Gulf, Center for Biological Diversity, Defenders of Wildlife, Earthjustice, and New England Aquarium submitted a petition to the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for rulemaking to establish a year-round 10-knot (kn) (5.1 meters/second) vessel speed limit and other vessel-related mitigation measures in the Rice's whale "core" habitat area. NMFS is requesting comments on the petition and will consider all comments and available information when determining whether to accept the petition and proceed with the suggested rulemaking.
