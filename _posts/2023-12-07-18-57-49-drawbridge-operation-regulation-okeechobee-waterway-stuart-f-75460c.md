## Summary

The Coast Guard is modifying a temporary deviation from the operating schedule that governs the Florida East Coast (FEC) Railroad Bridge, across the Okeechobee Waterway (OWW), mile 7.41, at Stuart, Florida. This modification extends the period the drawbridge may operate under the temporary deviation to the drawbridge operating schedule. This modification will allow the Coast Guard to review public comments and will provide continuity in the operation of the drawbridge until a determination is made if this temporary deviation will meet the reasonable needs of competing modes of transportation.
