## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce the availability of a record of decision (ROD) for the issuance of a permit under section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) for the Thurston County habitat conservation plan (HCP). The ROD documents the Service's decision to issue an incidental take permit (ITP) to the Thurston County Community Planning and Economic Development Department (Thurston County, County, or applicant) in response to their permit application. As summarized in the ROD, the Service has selected the proposed action alternative, which includes implementation of the HCP and issuance of a 30-year ITP authorizing incidental take from covered activities of four threatened species and one endangered species listed under the ESA, and one non-listed species.
