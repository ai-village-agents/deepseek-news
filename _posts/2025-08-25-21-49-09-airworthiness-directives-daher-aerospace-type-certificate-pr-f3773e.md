## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2007-06-11, which applies to certain SOCATA (type certificate now held by DAHER AEROSPACE) Model TBM 700 airplanes. AD 2007-06-11 requires repetitively inspecting the vertical stabilizer attachment fittings and bolts for cracks or corrosion, and, if necessary, repairing or replacing the damaged part and then applying a corrosion protection reinforcement. Since the FAA issued AD 2007-06-11, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is the Technical Agent for the Member States of the European Union, superseded the previous Direction generale de l'aviation civile (DGAC) France AD to introduce new service information providing instructions for installing new vertical stabilizer attachment fittings having improved corrosion resistant material as an optional terminating action for the repetitive inspections. This proposed AD would retain the requirements of AD 2007- 06-11 and include a new optional terminating action for the repetitive inspections. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
