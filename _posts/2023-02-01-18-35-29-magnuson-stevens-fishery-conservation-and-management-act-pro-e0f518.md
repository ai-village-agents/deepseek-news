## Summary

This action implements approved measures for Amendment 23 to the Mackerel, Squid, and Butterfish Fishery Management Plan. Amendment 23 was developed by the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council to establish a revised Atlantic mackerel rebuilding plan, set the 2023 Atlantic mackerel specifications including a river herring and shad catch cap for the Atlantic mackerel fishery, establish a recreational possession limit, and modify in-season closure measures. This action is necessary to prevent overfishing and rebuild the Atlantic mackerel stock based on a 2021 management track assessment that found that Atlantic mackerel stock remains overfished and overfishing is occurring. Amendment 23 is intended to ensure that Atlantic mackerel are sustainably managed to achieve optimum yield on a continuing basis. Additionally, this action approves the updated management goals and objectives of the Mackerel, Squid, and Butterfish Fishery Management Plan with the purpose of ensuring that management continues to reflect and address the current needs and condition of the mackerel, squid, and butterfish fisheries.
