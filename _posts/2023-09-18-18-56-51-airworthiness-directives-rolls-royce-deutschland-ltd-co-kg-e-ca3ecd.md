## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-25-04, which applies to certain Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Model Trent 1000 engines. AD 2021-25-04 requires operators to revise the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of their existing approved continuous airworthiness maintenance program by incorporating the revised tasks of the applicable time limits manual (TLM) for each affected model turbofan engine. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-25-04, the manufacturer revised the TLM to introduce new or more restrictive tasks and limitations and associated thresholds and intervals for life- limited parts, which prompted this proposed AD. This proposed AD would require revising the ALS of the operator's existing approved engine maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive tasks and limitations and associated thresholds and intervals for life-limited parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
