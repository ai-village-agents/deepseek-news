## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to grant, in part, and deny in part, the application from the American Public Transportation Association (APTA), on behalf of public transit agencies and their contractor partners. FMCSA grants the application request to allow State Driver Licensing Agencies (SDLAs) the option to waive the "under-the-hood" portion of the pre-trip vehicle inspection skills test requirement for commercial driver's license (CDL) applicants seeking to operate commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) in public transportation. Drivers issued CDLs pursuant to the requested exemption are restricted to intrastate operation of transit buses only. FMCSA denies APTA's application request to allow drivers issued a CDL under this exemption to operate in interstate commerce.
