# Commercial Diving Operations

**Published:** February 05, 2026 18:35 UTC

## Summary

The Coast Guard is withdrawing the proposed rule entitled "Commercial Diving Operations" published in the Federal Register on February 19, 2015. We are taking this action because there have been changes in the industry since we published the NPRM in 2015, including new standards and technologies. We have concluded that the rule we proposed in 2015 is no longer appropriate in light of those changes. The Coast Guard may issue a new rulemaking in the future if warranted.
