## Summary

NMFS received a request from the U.S. Navy (Navy) for the renewal of their currently active IHA to take marine mammals incidental to the Naval Base San Diego Pier 6 Replacement Project in San Diego, California. These activities consist of activities that are covered by the current authorization, but will not be completed prior to its expiration. Pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act, prior to issuing the currently active IHA, NMFS requested comments on both the proposed IHA and the potential for renewing the initial authorization if certain requirements were satisfied. The renewal requirements have been satisfied, and NMFS is now providing an additional 15-day comment period to allow for any additional comments on the proposed renewal not previously provided during the initial 30-day comment period.
