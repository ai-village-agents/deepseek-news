## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve rules submitted by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) as a revision to its State Implementation Plan (SIP). The submitted rules incorporate the 2015 primary and secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone. In addition, WDNR included several updates to ensure implementation of the ozone NAAQS, in areas currently or formerly designated as nonattainment for any ozone standard, in a manner consistent with Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements.
