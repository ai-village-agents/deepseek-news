## Summary

This action proposes to amend Alaskan Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airway V-436, jet route J-125, and to establish United States Area Navigation (RNAV) route T-399 in central Alaska. The airway actions are necessary due to the proposed amendment of restricted area R-2206 and proposed establishment of new restricted areas at Clear, AK. The FAA published a proposal to amend R- 2206 and establish new restricted areas to protect aircraft operating at or in the vicinity of Clear Airport (PACL), AK, from hazardous High- Intensity Radiated Field (HIRF) associated with the Missile Defense Agency's (MDA) Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) at Clear Air Force Station (Clear AFS).
