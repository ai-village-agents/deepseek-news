## Summary

DHS is withdrawing a proposed rule titled "Revision of Department of Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation; Limitations on Subcontracting in Emergency Acquisitions (HSAR Case 2009-005)" and providing notice of its cancellation. The notice of proposed rulemaking proposed to amend the Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) to implement a law that limited the use of subcontractors on cost- reimbursement type contracts entered into by the Department to facilitate the response to or recovery from a natural disaster or act of terrorism or other man-made disaster. DHS is withdrawing this proposed rule because Congress has since repealed this provision. Thus, DHS will not take any further action on this proposal.
