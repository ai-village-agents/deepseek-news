## Summary

The FAA is revising a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that would have applied to all Safran Helicopter Engines, S.A. (Safran) (type certificate previously held by Turbomeca, S.A.) Model Arriel 2D and Arriel 2E engines. This action revises the NPRM by proposing to require updating the airworthiness limitation section (ALS) of the existing engine maintenance manual (EMM) or instructions for continued airworthiness (ICA) and the existing approved maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, by incorporating the actions and associated thresholds and intervals, including life limits, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) airworthiness directive (AD), which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would revise the required actions proposed in the NPRM, the agency is requesting comments on this SNPRM.
