## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-09- 06, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. AD 2022-09-06 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. This AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2022-09- 06 and requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate additional new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
