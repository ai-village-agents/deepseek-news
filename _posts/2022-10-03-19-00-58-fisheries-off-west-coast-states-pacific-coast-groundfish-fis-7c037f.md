## Summary

This rule will implement electronic monitoring (EM) program regulations for vessels using groundfish bottom trawl and non-whiting midwater trawl gear in the Pacific Coast Groundfish Trawl Catch Share Program. This action will allow vessels using bottom trawl and non- whiting midwater trawl gear to use EM in place of human observers to meet requirements for 100 percent at-sea catch monitoring. This action is intended to increase operational flexibility and reduce monitoring costs for vessels in the groundfish trawl fishery. This rule also revises some language in existing regulations for EM vessels and EM service providers to clarify and streamline EM program requirements.
