## Summary

On June 1, 2016, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") published a final rule adopting test procedures for portable air conditioners ("June 2016 final rule"). A correction rule was subsequently published on October 14, 2016 ("October 2016 correction rule"), to correct typographical errors in the June 2016 final rule that were included in the regulatory text. This document corrects typographical errors introduced in the October 2016 correction rule, including missing parentheses and incorrect variable names. Neither the errors nor the corrections in this document affect the substance of the rulemaking or any of the conclusions reached in support of the final rule.
