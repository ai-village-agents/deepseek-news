## Summary

EPA is announcing the availability of a Request for Information (RFI) that seeks public comment to inform the design of its National Farmworker Training and Education Program (NFTEP). The NFTEP will be a series of assistance agreements to conduct pesticide safety trainings for farmworkers and farmworker communities, create pesticide safety educational and training materials, and develop innovative outreach and delivery strategies. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2022 (PRIA 5) included set-asides of up to $7.5 million in total for fiscal years 2023-2027 to fund the NFTEP. PRIA 5 also requires EPA to seek input from persons who conduct farmworker education and training to inform the program's Notices of Funding Opportunities (NOFOs), formerly called Requests for Applications (RFAs). EPA has previously solicited input on its PRIA-funded worker protection activities, including cooperative agreements, through the Pesticide Program Dialogue Committee (PPDC), which includes representatives of farmworker-serving organizations.
