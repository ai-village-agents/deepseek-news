# Fisheries of the Northeastern United States; Northeast Multispecies Fishery; White Hake Trimester Total Allowable Catch Area Closure for the Common Pool Fishery

## Summary

This action closes the White Hake Trimester Total Allowable Catch Area to Northeast multispecies common pool vessels fishing with trawl gear, sink gillnet gear, and longline/hook gear, except for Handgear A and B permitted vessels using handgear or tub trawl, through April 30, 2023. The closure is required because the common pool fishery is projected to have caught over 90 percent of its Trimester 3 quota for white hake. This closure is intended to prevent an overage of the common pool's quota for this stock.
