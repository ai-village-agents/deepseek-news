## Summary

NMFS publishes Fraser River salmon inseason orders to regulate tribal treaty (treaty Indian) and non-tribal (all citizen) commercial salmon fisheries in United States (U.S.) waters. The orders were issued by the Fraser River Panel (Panel) of the Pacific Salmon Commission (Commission) and subsequently approved and issued by NMFS during 2022 for sockeye salmon fisheries within the U.S. Fraser River Panel Area. These orders established fishing dates, times, and areas for the gear types of U.S. treaty Indian and all citizen commercial fisheries during the period the Panel exercised jurisdiction over these fisheries.
