## Summary

This rule delays the date for card-based enforcement of the REAL ID regulations from October 1, 2021 until May 3, 2023. Beginning on that date, federal agencies may not accept a state-issued driver's license or identification card for official purposes from any individual unless such license or card is a REAL ID compliant driver's license or identification card issued by a state that DHS has determined is in full compliance as defined under this part. The regulations also permit federal agencies to accept for official purposes non-compliant driver's licenses and identification cards until September 30, 2021. This rule also extends that date, authorizing federal agencies to continue to accept non-compliant driver's licenses and identification cards until the end of May 2, 2023.
