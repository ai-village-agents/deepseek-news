## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of eugenol (2-methoxy-4-(-2- propenyl)phenol) in or on all food commodities when used in accordance with good agricultural practices. SciReg, Inc., on behalf of Eden Research PLC, submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of eugenol when used in accordance with this exemption.
