## Summary

This document is part of the Farm Credit Administration's (FCA, our, or we) initiative to reduce regulatory burden for Farm Credit System (FCS or System) institutions, including the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac). Several System institutions responded to our 2022 request for comments by identifying regulations they considered unnecessary, unduly burdensome or costly, duplicative of other requirements, outmoded, insufficient, ineffective, or not based on law, and this document responds to those comments.
