## Summary

The Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the United States Small Business Administration (SBA), pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act may not provide duplicative disaster assistance to individuals, businesses, including Private-Not- for Profits (PNPs), or other entities for the same disaster or emergency losses. DHS/FEMA and SBA will participate in a Computer Matching program to share federal records regarding financial/benefits award decisions of individuals, businesses, and/or other entities to verify eligibility for benefits, prevent duplicative aid from being provided in response to the same disaster or emergency, and recover aid when duplication of benefits is identified. This proposed Agreement re- establishes the Computer Matching program between DHS/FEMA and SBA that is set to expire on March 2, 2024.
