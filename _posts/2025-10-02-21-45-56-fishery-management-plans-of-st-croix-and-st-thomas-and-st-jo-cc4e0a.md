## Summary

NMFS proposes to implement management measures described in Framework Action 3 under both the St. Croix Fishery Management Plan (FMP) and the St. Thomas and St. John FMP (collectively Framework Action 3), as prepared by the Caribbean Fishery Management Council (Council). If implemented, this proposed rule would modify the annual catch limits (ACLs) for queen triggerfish in Federal waters around St. Croix and in Federal waters around St. Thomas and St. John. The purpose of this proposed rule and Framework Action 3 is to update management reference points for queen triggerfish under the St. Croix FMP and the St. Thomas and St. John FMP consistent with the most recent stock assessments to prevent overfishing and achieve optimum yield (OY).
