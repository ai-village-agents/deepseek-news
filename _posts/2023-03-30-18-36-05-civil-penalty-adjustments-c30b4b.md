## Summary

The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) is adjusting the maximum and minimum civil monetary penalties that may be imposed for violations of its New Restrictions on Lobbying and Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act regulations to reflect the requirements of the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, as amended by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015. This final rule provides the 2023 annual inflation adjustments to the initial "catch-up" adjustments made on April 21, 2020, and August 13, 2021, and reflects all other inflation adjustments made in the interim. This final rule also codifies the statutory formula for inflation adjustments in NEH's New Restrictions on Lobbying and Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act regulations, so that NEH may publish a Notice in the Federal Register indicating the civil monetary penalty adjustment amounts for each regulation in January 2024 and every calendar year thereafter.
