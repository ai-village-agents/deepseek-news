## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model H160-B helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of excessive axial play of the rotating scissors spherical bearings. This AD requires measuring the axial play of the rotating scissors spherical bearings and, depending on the results, accomplishing corrective action and reporting inspection results, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
