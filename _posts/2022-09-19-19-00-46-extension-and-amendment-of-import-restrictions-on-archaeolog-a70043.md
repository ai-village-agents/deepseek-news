## Summary

This document amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regulations to reflect an extension and amendment of import restrictions on certain categories of archaeological and ethnological material from the Republic of Mali (Mali) to fulfill the terms of the new agreement, titled "Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Mali Concerning the Imposition of Import Restrictions on Categories of Archaeological and Ethnological Material of Mali." The Designated List, which was last described in CBP Dec. 17-12, is amended in this document to reflect additional categories of archaeological material found throughout the entirety of Mali and additional categories of ethnological material associated with religious activities, ceremonies, or rites, and enforcement of import restrictions is being extended for an additional five years by this final rule.
