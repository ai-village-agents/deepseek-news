## Summary

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) announces its decision to grant Gemini Motor Transport LP's, USDOT No. 913300, (Gemini) application for an exemption to allow it to operate commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) equipped with a module manufactured by Intellistop, Inc. (Intellistop). The Intellistop module is designed to pulse the required rear clearance, identification, and brake lamps from a lower-level lighting intensity to a higher-level lighting intensity 4 times in 2 seconds when the brakes are applied and then return the lights to a steady-burning state while the brakes remain engaged. The Agency has determined that granting the exemption to Gemini, an individual, easily identifiable motor carrier operating a finite number of CMVs, would likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to, or greater than, the level of safety achieved by the regulation.
