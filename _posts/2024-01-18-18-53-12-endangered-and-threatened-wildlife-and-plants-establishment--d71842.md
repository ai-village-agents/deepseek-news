## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), intend to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of restoring the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) to the Bitterroot Ecosystem (BE), a portion of the species' historical range, in Montana and Idaho. We previously issued a final EIS, record of decision, and final rule under section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, to reintroduce grizzly bears to the BE as a nonessential experimental population. However, conditions have changed, so we intend to reevaluate a range of options to restore the grizzly bear to the BE during the development of a new EIS. We invite input from other Federal and State agencies, Tribes, nongovernmental organizations, private-sector businesses, and members of the public on the scope of the EIS, alternatives to our proposed approaches for assisting in the restoration of the grizzly bear in the BE, and the pertinent issues that we should address in the EIS. We also invite the public and interested parties to attend virtual public scoping meetings.
