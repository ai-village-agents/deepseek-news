## Summary

The Postal Service proposes to provide unique electronic service codes and to standardize extra service options for shipments of hazardous materials (HAZMAT). If adopted, this proposal would amend Publication 52, Hazardous, Restricted, and Perishable Mail (Pub 52) by requiring the use of unique service type codes and extra service codes within the electronic data submission and tracking barcodes for shipments containing HAZMAT provided to the USPS by the mailers in their Shipping Services File (SSF). This proposal would standardize the acceptance and handling of shipments containing HAZMAT by collecting electronic data to create manifests for the Postal Service's air carrier suppliers and ensuring these items are handled appropriately with regards to the category of HAMZAT contained within the package. The Postal Service also proposes to amend the Mailing Standards of the United States Postal Service Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) that would alter the refund eligibility of Priority Mail Express containing hazardous materials.
