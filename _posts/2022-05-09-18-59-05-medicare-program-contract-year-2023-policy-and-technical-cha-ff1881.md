## Summary

This final rule will revise the Medicare Advantage (MA) (Part C) program and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Part D) program regulations to implement changes related to marketing and communications, past performance, Star Ratings, network adequacy, medical loss ratio reporting, special requirements during disasters or public emergencies, and pharmacy price concessions. This final rule will also revise regulations related to dual eligible special needs plans (D-SNPs), other special needs plans, and cost contract plans. This final rule finalizes certain 2021 and 2022 Star Ratings provisions that were included in two interim final rules with comment period (IFC) that CMS issued on April 6, 2020, and September 2, 2020; other policies from those interim final rules will be addressed in other rulemakings.
