## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing a limited approval and limited disapproval of two revised rules and an approval of a rule recission to the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from marine and pleasure craft coating operations and the coating of metals. The EPA previously proposed to fully approve these SIP revisions on the grounds that they satisfied the relevant requirements under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act). After the comment periods, the EPA identified a deficiency in the submittals that warrants a limited disapproval. Therefore, we are withdrawing our previously proposed approvals of these SIP revisions as they pertain to these rules, published in the Federal Register on May 20, 2021, and August 24, 2021, and now propose a limited approval and limited disapproval for these revisions into the California SIP.
