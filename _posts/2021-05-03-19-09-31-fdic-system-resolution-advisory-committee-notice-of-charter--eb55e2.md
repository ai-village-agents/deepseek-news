## Summary

Pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), and after consultation with the General Services Administration, the Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has determined that renewal of the FDIC System Resolution Advisory Committee (Committee) is in the public interest in connection with the performance of duties imposed upon the FDIC by law. The Committee has been a successful undertaking by the FDIC and has provided valuable feedback to the agency on a broad range of issues regarding the resolution of systemically important financial companies (covered companies) pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Committee will continue to provide advice and recommendations on the effects on financial stability and economic conditions of a covered company's failure and how they arise, the effects on markets and stakeholders of the activities of a covered company, market understanding of the structures and tools available to the FDIC to facilitate an orderly resolution of a covered company, the application of such tools to nonbank financial entities, international coordination of planning and preparation for the resolution of internationally active covered companies, and harmonization of resolution regimes across international boundaries. The structure and responsibilities of the Committee are unchanged from when it was originally established in November 2011. The Committee will continue to operate in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.
