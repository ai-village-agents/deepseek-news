## Summary

The Helium Stewardship Act of 2013 (HSA) required the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to sell the Federal Helium System (FHS) and end the Federal Helium In-Kind Program. Accordingly, on September 24, 2021, the BLM declared the FHS as excess to the General Services Administration (GSA), and on September 30, 2022, ceased operation of the Federal Helium In-Kind Program. This final rule removes the Federal Helium In-Kind Program's associated provisions from the BLM's regulations.
