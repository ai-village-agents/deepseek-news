## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directives (ADs) 2005-15-11, 2016-07-09, and 2018-19-24, which apply to all BAE Systems (Operations) Limited Model 4101 airplanes. AD 2005-15-11 requires repetitive detailed and specialized inspections to detect fatigue damage in the fuselage, replacement of certain bolt assemblies, and corrective actions if necessary. AD 2016-07-09 requires a revision of the maintenance or inspection program, as applicable. AD 2018-19-24 requires a one-time detailed inspection of a certain fuselage frame and repair, if necessary, and a revision of the maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or revised maintenance instructions and airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued those ADs, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2016-07-09 and 2018-19-24 and require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
