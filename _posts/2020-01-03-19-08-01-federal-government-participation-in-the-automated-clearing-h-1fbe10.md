## Summary

The Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) is proposing to amend its regulation governing the use of the Automated Clearing House (ACH) Network by Federal agencies. Our regulation adopts, with some exceptions, the Nacha Operating Rules developed by Nacha, formerly known as NACHA--The Electronic Payments Association (Nacha), as the rules governing the use of the ACH Network by Federal agencies. We are issuing this proposed rule to address changes that Nacha has made to the Nacha Operating Rules since the publication of the 2016 Nacha Operating Rules & Guidelines book. These changes include amendments set forth in the 2017, 2018, and 2019 Nacha Operating Rules & Guidelines books, including supplements thereto, with an effective date on or before June 30, 2021.
