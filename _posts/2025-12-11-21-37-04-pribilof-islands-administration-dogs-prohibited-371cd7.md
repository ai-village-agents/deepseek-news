## Summary

NMFS proposes to revise regulations that prohibit dogs on the Pribilof Islands by creating an exception for NMFS to authorize certified and trained rodent detection dogs to respond to and prevent the establishment of invasive rodents on the Pribilof Islands. Invasive rodents could have significant consequences for the wildlife species that live and breed on the Pribilof Islands and the health and food security of community members. This action supports Tribal, local, and Federal agency efforts and is intended to promote the goals and objectives of the Fur Seal Act (FSA), the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), and other applicable laws.
