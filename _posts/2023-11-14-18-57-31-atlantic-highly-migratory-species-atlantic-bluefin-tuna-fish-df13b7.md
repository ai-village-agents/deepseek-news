## Summary

NMFS is adjusting the Atlantic bluefin tuna (BFT) General category December 2023 subquota by transferring quota from the Reserve category. This adjustment results in an adjusted December time period subquota of 48.7 mt and an adjusted Reserve category quota of 1 mt. This action accounts for the accrued overharvest from previous 2023 General category time period subquotas, and will further opportunities for General category fishermen to participate in the December General category fishery, based on consideration of the regulatory determination criteria regarding inseason adjustments. This action would affect Atlantic Tunas General category (commercial) permitted vessels and Highly Migratory Species (HMS) Charter/Headboat permitted vessels with a commercial sale endorsement when fishing commercially for BFT.
