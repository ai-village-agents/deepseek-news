## Summary

The FAA proposes to rule and invites public comment on the application for a release and disposal of approximately 0.31 acres of federally obligated airport property at Morgantown Municipal Airport, Morgantown, WV, from Grant Assurance obligations. This acreage is composed of two parcels of land that was acquired by the City of Morgantown on October 30, 1972 by conveyance from Joseph and Phyllis Marshall through FAA Project #8-54-0015-02. The release will allow the West Virginia Division of Highways to widen West Run Road (County Route 67/ 1). The land requested for release is not required for aviation use and development and will not interfere with the airport or its operation.
