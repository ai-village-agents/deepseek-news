## Summary

The Internal Revenue Service, as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, invites the public and other Federal agencies to take this opportunity to comment on the continuing information collections, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. Currently, the IRS is soliciting comments concerning the postponement of certain acts by reason of service in a combat zone or relating to postponement of certain tax-related deadlines by reason of a Presidentially declared disaster.
