## Summary

This Notice advises the public that the Indian Health Service (IHS) proposes to expand the geographic boundaries of the Purchased/ Referred Care Delivery Area (PRCDA) for the Hoh Tribe in the State of Washington to include the county of Clallam in the State of Washington. The current PRCDA for the Hoh Tribe includes the Washington county of Jefferson. Hoh Tribe members residing outside of the PRCDA are eligible for direct care services, however, they are not eligible for Purchased/ Referred Care (PRC) services. The sole purpose of this expansion would be to authorize additional Hoh Tribe members and beneficiaries to receive PRC services.
