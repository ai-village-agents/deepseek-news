## Summary

NMFS has approved four companies to provide industry-funded monitoring services (observing, at-sea monitoring, and/or portside sampling) to Atlantic herring vessels during industry-funded monitoring years 2020-2021 (April 1, 2020-March 31, 2022). Monitoring coverage regulations require that any entities seeking to provide monitoring services, including services for industry-funded monitoring programs, must apply for and obtain approval from NMFS. This action will allow Atlantic herring vessels to secure industry-funded monitoring services from any of the approved providers during 2020-2021.
