## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary special local regulation in Los Angeles Harbor during the Sail Grand Prix Race event from July 21, 2023, through July 23, 2023. This proposed rulemaking is necessary to ensure the safety of race participants, participant vessels, spectators, and mariners transiting the area from the dangers associated with high-speed sailing activities during the event. This proposed regulation will prohibit vessels and persons not participating in the race event from entering the dedicated race area unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Sector Los Angeles-Long Beach or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
