## Summary

Whenever the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgates a new or revised National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), the Clean Air Act requires each state to make a State Implementation Plan (SIP) submission to establish that its SIP provides for the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of the revised NAAQS. This type of SIP submission is commonly referred to as an infrastructure SIP submission. The EPA is approving the State of Washington's September 30, 2019 and April 3, 2020, SIP submissions as meeting specific infrastructure requirements for the 2010 sulfur dioxide and 2015 ozone NAAQS.
