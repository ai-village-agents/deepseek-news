## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled "COVID-19: Developing Drugs and Biological Products for Treatment or Prevention." This guidance describes FDA's current recommendations regarding phase 2 or phase 3 trials for drugs or biological products under development for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Given the public health emergency presented by COVID-19, this guidance document is being implemented without prior public comment because FDA has determined that prior public participation is not feasible or appropriate, but it remains subject to comment in accordance with the Agency's good guidance practices. This final guidance revises and replaces the final guidance of the same name issued on May 11, 2020. Revisions were made to address the evolving landscape of COVID-19 drug development, including the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the availability of COVID-19 vaccines. The revision to this guidance was posted to the FDA website on February 22, 2021.
