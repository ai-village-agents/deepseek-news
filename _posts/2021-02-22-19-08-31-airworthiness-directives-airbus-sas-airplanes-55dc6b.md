## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A330-200 Freighter series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report indicating occurrences of broken brackets of the support structure of the halon fire extinguishing bottle 4005WX; investigation showed that fatigue cracks initiated in the attachment brackets at the cross beams due to dynamic loading, and in some cases propagated in the struts. This proposed AD would require replacing the support brackets of the 4005WX fire extinguisher bottle with reinforced support brackets, and replacing the strut assembly at the affected location, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
