## Summary

We are soliciting public comment on our plan to strengthen regulations regarding the handling of wild and exotic animals for exhibition, as well as the training of personnel involved in the handling of wild and exotic animals, and to establish standards addressing environmental enrichment for all regulated animals. The changes we are considering would help ensure the humane handling and treatment of exhibited animals, as well as the health and well-being of all animals covered under the Animal Welfare Act.
