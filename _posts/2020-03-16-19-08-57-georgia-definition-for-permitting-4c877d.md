## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a portion of a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Georgia, through the Georgia Department of Natural Resources' Environmental Protection Division (also known as GA EPD), on September 19, 2006, with a clarification submitted on November 6, 2006 and a supplemental submittal transmitted on November 27, 2019. EPA is proposing to approve portions of a definition that impacts existing minor new source review (NSR) permitting regulations because the State has demonstrated it is consistent with the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act).
