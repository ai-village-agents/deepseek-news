## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled "M12 Drug Interaction Studies." The draft guidance was prepared under the auspices of the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH), formerly the International Conference on Harmonisation. The draft guidance provides general recommendations on how to evaluate the pharmacokinetic drug interaction potential mediated via enzyme and transporter for investigational drugs. The draft guidance harmonizes the regional requirements on in vitro and clinical evaluation of drug-drug interactions for a more consistent approach in design, conduct, and interpretation of enzyme and transporter-mediated interaction during the development of an investigational drug. The draft guidance is intended to decrease the risk of adverse events, sometimes leading to hospital admissions or reduced treatment efficacy.
