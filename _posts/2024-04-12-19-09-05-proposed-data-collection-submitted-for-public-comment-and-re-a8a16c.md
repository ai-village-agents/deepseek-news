## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled B. multivorans Ice Machine Multistate Investigation. This is an outbreak investigation which aims to evaluate the associations between Burkholderia multivorans infections among hospitalized patients and potential exposures to nonsterile ice and water from ice machines to help inform measures to prevent ongoing transmission.
