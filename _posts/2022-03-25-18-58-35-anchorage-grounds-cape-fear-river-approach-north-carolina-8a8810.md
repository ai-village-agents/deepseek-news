## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to amend the anchorage regulations for Lockwoods Folly Inlet, NC, and adjacent navigable waters, by establishing a new offshore anchorage, relocating the existing explosives anchorage and amending the anchorage regulations. The purpose of this supplemental proposed rule is to improve navigation and public safety by accommodating recent and anticipated future growth in cargo vessel traffic and vessel size that call on Military Ocean Terminal Sunny Point and the Port of Wilmington, North Carolina. We invite your comments on this supplemental proposed rulemaking.
