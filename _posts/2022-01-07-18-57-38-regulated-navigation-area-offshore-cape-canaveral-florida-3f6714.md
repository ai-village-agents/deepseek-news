## Summary

On September 17, 2021, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) proposing to replace the existing safety zone in Captain of the Port (COTP) zone Jacksonville, Offshore Cape Canaveral, Florida with a regulated navigation area (RNA). Changes in the type and size of launch vehicles, rocket component recovery methods, and the increased frequency of launches now pose variable risks to marine traffic and require a more flexible regulatory tool. After considering comments received from the public, the Coast Guard is making modifications to the regulated area in the proposed rule. This supplemental notice requests comments on the revised proposal.
