## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) permanently debarring Sunrise Lee from providing services in any capacity to a person that has an approved or pending drug product application. FDA bases this order on a finding that Ms. Lee was convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct that relates to the regulation of a drug product under the FD&C Act. Ms. Lee was given notice of the proposed permanent debarment and an opportunity to request a hearing to show why she should not be debarred. As of October 8, 2020 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Ms. Lee had not responded. Ms. Lee's failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of her right to a hearing concerning this action.
