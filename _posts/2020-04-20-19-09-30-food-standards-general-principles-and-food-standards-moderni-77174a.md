## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is extending the comment period for the proposed rule that appeared in the Federal Register of May 20, 2005. The proposed rule, entitled "Food Standards; General Principles and Food Standards Modernization," would establish a set of general principles for food standards for FDA to use when considering whether to establish, revise, or eliminate a food standard. The proposed rule was issued jointly with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and, while FDA will continue to engage with USDA regarding the proposed rule, we are extending the comment period to allow interested persons additional time to submit comments.
