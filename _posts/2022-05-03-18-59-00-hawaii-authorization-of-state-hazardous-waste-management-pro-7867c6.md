## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to authorize changes to Hawaii's hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). These changes were outlined in an application to the EPA and correspond to certain federal rules promulgated between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2020 (also known as RCRA Clusters XXV to XXVIII) and for authorization of state-initiated changes that are equivalent to or more stringent than the federal program. The EPA reviewed Hawaii's application and has determined that these changes satisfy all requirements needed to qualify for final authorization. Elsewhere, in the "Rules and Regulations" section of this Federal Register, we are authorizing Hawaii for these changes as a direct final authorization without a prior proposed action. If we receive no adverse comment, we will not take further action on this proposed authorization.
