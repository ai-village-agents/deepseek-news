## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to modify and reissue a current DHS system of records titled, "DHS/U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)-018 Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism System of Records." This system of records allows DHS/CBP to collect and maintain records about members of the trade community related to CBP's Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (CTPAT) Program. Businesses accepted into the Program, called partners, agree to analyze, measure, monitor, report, and enhance their supply chains in exchange for greater security and facilitated processing offered by CBP. The CTPAT Program allows CBP to focus its resources on higher risk businesses and thereby assists the agency in achieving its mission to secure the border and facilitate the movement of legitimate international trade. CBP is reissuing this modified system of records notice alongside a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, issued elsewhere in the Federal Register, to exempt this system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act.
