## Summary

The U.S. Department of Transportation (Department or DOT) proposes to amend its drug-testing program regulation, 49 CFR part 40 (part 40), to add fentanyl (a synthetic opioid) and norfentanyl (a metabolite of fentanyl) to its drug testing panels. The proposed rulemaking would harmonize part 40 with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs (Mandatory Guidelines), which DOT must follow for the minimum list of drugs for which DOT requires testing, and the comprehensive standards for laboratory drug testing per the Omnibus Employee Testing Act of 1991. Adding fentanyl and norfentanyl is also in the interest of transportation safety, given compelling information regarding the number of overdose deaths in the United States involving fentanyl. The Department also proposes to amend certain provisions of part 40 to harmonize, as appropriate, with the current HHS Mandatory Guidelines using urine (UrMG) and oral fluid (OFMG). This NPRM also proposes to clarify certain existing part 40 drug testing program provisions and to make technical amendments.
