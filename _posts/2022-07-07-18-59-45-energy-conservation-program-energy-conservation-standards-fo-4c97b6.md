# Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Consumer Furnaces

## Summary

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended ("EPCA"), prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment, including consumer furnaces. EPCA also requires the Department of Energy ("DOE" or "the Department") to periodically determine whether more-stringent, amended standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would result in significant energy savings. In this notice of proposed rulemaking ("NOPR"), DOE proposes amended energy conservation standards for non-weatherized gas furnaces and mobile home gas furnaces, and also announces a public meeting webinar to receive comment on these proposed standards and associated analyses and results.
