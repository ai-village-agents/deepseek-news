## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to deny reconsideration of the Agency's initial denial of the application for exemption filed by United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS). UPS originally sought exemption from a provision in the Entry-Level Driver Training (ELDT) final rule requiring two years of experience for training instructors. FMCSA denied that petition on December 9, 2019. UPS believes that its current process of preparing driver trainers exceeds any skill set gained merely by operating a tractor-trailer for two years. UPS stated that its reconsideration request would ensure that it can continue to exceed the current regulatory requirements and provide proper training of its drivers and improve highway and public safety. FMCSA analyzed the petition for reconsideration and the public comments submitted, and determined that the application lacked evidence that would ensure that an equivalent level of safety or greater would likely be achieved absent such exemption.
