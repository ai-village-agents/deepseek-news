## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Kidde Aerospace & Defense cargo fire extinguisher halon bottles installed on various transport category airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report indicating that certain cargo fire extinguisher halon bottles installed in the cargo compartment had low charge pressure. This proposed AD would require an inspection to determine the part number and serial number of the cargo fire extinguisher halon bottles and replacement of affected parts with serviceable parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
