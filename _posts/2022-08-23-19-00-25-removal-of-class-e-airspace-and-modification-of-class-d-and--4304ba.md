## Summary

This action removes the Class E airspace, designated as an extension to a Class D or Class E surface area, at Point Mugu Naval Air Station (NAS) Airport, Oxnard, CA. This action also modifies the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface. Furthermore, this action removes the Class E airspace extending upward from 1,200 feet above the surface and the Class E airspace extending upward from 5,000 feet mean sea level (MSL), as both of these areas are contained within the Los Angeles Class E en route airspace and duplication is not necessary. Lastly, this action updates the Class D and Class E5 airspace legal descriptions. These actions ensure the safety and management of visual flight rules (VFR) and instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at the airport.
