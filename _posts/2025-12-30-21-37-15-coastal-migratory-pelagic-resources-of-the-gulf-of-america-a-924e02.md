## Summary

NMFS implements an accountability measure (AM) for king mackerel using run-around gillnet gear in the southern zone of the Gulf of America (Gulf) exclusive economic zone (EEZ) for the 2025-2026 fishing year. NMFS has determined that commercial landings of king mackerel harvested by run-around gillnet gear in the Gulf southern zone in the 2024-2025 fishing year have exceeded the component's annual catch limit (ACL). Therefore, NMFS implements the AM to reduce the commercial gillnet component ACL for king mackerel in the Gulf southern zone for the 2025-2026 fishing year.
