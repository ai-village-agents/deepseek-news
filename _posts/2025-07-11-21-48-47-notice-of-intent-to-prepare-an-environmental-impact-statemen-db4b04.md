## Summary

The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) intends to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the Verde Reservoirs Sediment Mitigation Project (VRSMP or Project) in Maricopa and Yavapai Counties, Arizona. The VRSMP is a feasibility study authorized by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Public Law 117-58, 135 Statute 429, section 40902(a)(1)(B)(i). The purpose of the Project is to restore lost capacity from sedimentation at Horseshoe Reservoir to mitigate reservoir sediment accumulation while addressing future water supply resiliency through increased surface water yield from the Salt River Federal Reclamation Project (SRFRP) Verde River reservoir system. Reclamation is seeking public comments to identify significant issues, effects, or other alternatives to be addressed in the EIS. Reclamation is also requesting relevant information, studies, or analyses with respect to the proposed action alternatives.
