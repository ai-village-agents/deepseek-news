## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is reproposing to approve under the Clean Air Act an element of the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision for attaining the 1-hour sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) primary national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for the Southwest Indiana nonattainment area (including parts of Daviess and Pike Counties), based on revised limits for the Indianapolis Power and Light's Petersburg facility (IP&L-Petersburg) that Indiana submitted on September 18, 2019. Indiana's revised limits are based on the same dispersion modeling and the same 1-hour average emission rates that EPA proposed to conclude would result in attainment. However, the revised limits reflect revised calculations of the degree of adjustment needed for the 30-day average limits to be comparably stringent to 1-hour limits at the modeled emission rates. EPA is soliciting additional comments that may arise from these revisions.
