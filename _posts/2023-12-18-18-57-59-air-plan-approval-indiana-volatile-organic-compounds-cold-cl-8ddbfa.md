## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving revisions to the volatile organic compound (VOC) rules contained in the Indiana State Implementation Plan (SIP). The Indiana Department of Environmental Management (Indiana) modified its rules to allow the use of a VOC control device for cold cleaning degreasing operations as a compliance option to using low vapor pressure solvent for cleaning or degreasing machine parts. Rule language was also updated for clarity and consistency. EPA proposed to approve this action on August 30, 2023, and received no adverse comments.
