## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") is adopting amendments to certain rules that govern beneficial ownership reporting. The amendments generally shorten the filing deadlines for initial and amended beneficial ownership reports filed on Schedules 13D and 13G. The amendments also clarify the disclosure requirements of Schedule 13D with respect to derivative securities. We also are expanding the timeframe within a given business day by which Schedules 13D and 13G must be filed, and separately requiring that Schedule 13D and 13G filings be made using a structured, machine-readable data language. Further, we discuss how, under the current rules, an investor's use of a cash-settled derivative security may result in the person being treated as a beneficial owner of the class of the reference equity security. We also are providing guidance on the application of the current legal standard found in section 13(d)(3) and 13(g)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to certain common types of shareholder engagement activities. Finally, we are making certain technical revisions.
