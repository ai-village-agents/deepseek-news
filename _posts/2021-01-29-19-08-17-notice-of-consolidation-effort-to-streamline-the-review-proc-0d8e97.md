## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has completed a consolidation effort to streamline the review process pertaining to staff guidance for spent fuel storage and radioactive material transportation packages. NUREG-1536, and NUREG-1567 have been consolidated into NUREG-2215 (NRC-2017-0211), and similarly, NUREG-1609 and NUREG-1617 have been consolidated into in NUREG-2216 (NRC-2019- 0132), as well as all associated supplements and Spent Fuel Storage and Transportation Interim Staff Guidance (ISG). A notice of this consolidation has been posted on each of the affected web pages and redirects to NUREG-2215 and NUREG-2216 have been provided. Note that the retired standard review plans (SRPs) and ISG still remain available for reference as legacy documents, with links provided on each web page.
