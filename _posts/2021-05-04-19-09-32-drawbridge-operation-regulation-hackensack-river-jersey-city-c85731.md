## Summary

The Coast Guard is modifying the operating schedule that governs the Route 7 Bridge, across the Hackensack River, mile 3.1, at Jersey City, NJ. The bridge owner, New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT), submitted a request to allow the bridge to require four hours advance notice for bridge openings. This final rule would create efficiency in drawbridge operations and better serve the needs of the community while continuing to meet the reasonable needs of navigation.
