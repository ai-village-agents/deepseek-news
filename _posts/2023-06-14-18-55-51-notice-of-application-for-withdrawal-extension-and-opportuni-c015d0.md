## Summary

On behalf of the United States Department of Agriculture, the United States Forest Service (USFS) filed an application with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) requesting that the Secretary of the Interior extend Public Land Order (PLO) No. 7587 for an additional 20- year term. PLO No. 7587 withdrew 852 acres of National Forest System lands in Socorro County, New Mexico, from location and entry under the United States mining laws, subject to valid existing rights, to protect the USFS-managed research site for a period of 20 years. The withdrawal created by PLO No. 7587 will expire on October 26, 2023, unless extended. This notice announces to the public an opportunity to comment on the proposal and to request a public meeting.
