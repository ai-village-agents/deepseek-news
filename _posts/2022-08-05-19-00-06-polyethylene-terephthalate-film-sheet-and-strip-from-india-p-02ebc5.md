## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on polyethylene terephthalate film, sheet, and strip (PET film) from India. The period of review (POR) is July 1, 2020, through June 30, 2021. This review covers two producers and exporters of PET film from India, Jindal Poly Films (Jindal) and SRF Limited (SRF). We preliminarily determine that neither company made sales of subject merchandise below normal value (NV) during the POR. We are also rescinding the review with respect to six companies because all requests for review for these companies have been withdrawn. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.
