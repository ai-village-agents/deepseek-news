## Summary

Federal commercial tilefish permit holders are prohibited from fishing for, catching, possessing, transferring or landing blueline tilefish in the Tilefish Management Unit for the remainder of the 2023 fishing year. This action is required when NMFS projects that 100 percent of the 2023 total allowable landings will be caught by the effective date. This action is intended to prevent over-harvest of blueline tilefish for the fishing year.
