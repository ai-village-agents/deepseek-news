## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve revisions, under the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act"), to portions of the Arizona, California, and Nevada State Implementation Plans (SIPs) regarding emissions statements (ES) requirements for the 2015 ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). We are also taking final action to approve ES certifications ("certifications") adopted by various California air districts that existing SIP-approved rules are adequate to meet the ES requirements for the 2015 ozone NAAQS. In addition, we are finalizing our proposal that the following Arizona, California, and Nevada nonattainment areas (NAAs) meet the ES requirements for the 2015 ozone NAAQS: Phoenix-Mesa, Yuma, Amador County, Butte County, Imperial County, Los Angeles-San Bernardino Counties (West Mojave Desert), Los Angeles-South Coast Air Basin, Nevada County (Western part), Riverside County (Coachella Valley), Sacramento Metro, San Diego County, San Francisco Bay Area, San Joaquin Valley, San Luis Obispo (Eastern part), Sutter Buttes, Tuolumne County, Ventura County, and Las Vegas. We are also finalizing our proposal that two NAAs meet requirements for prior ozone NAAQS. Lastly, we are finalizing our proposal that Maricopa County Air Quality District (MCAQD) Rule 100, section 503, which we approved on February 15, 2022, meets the ES requirements for the 2015 ozone NAAQS.
