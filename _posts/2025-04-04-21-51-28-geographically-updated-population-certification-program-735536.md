## Summary

The Census Bureau will modify the Geographically Updated Population Certification Program (GUPCP) by removing the expedited processing option for certified decennial census population and housing counts associated with updated government boundaries. The GUPCP is a fee-based service that was reinstated on January 1, 2024. The service provides the requesting government a new certification of 2020 Census population and housing counts based on boundary updates that became legally effective after the 2020 Census. Government boundaries effective on or before January 1, 2020, were used for 2020 Census population and housing tabulation.
