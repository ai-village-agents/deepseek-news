## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Hamilton Sundstrand Corporation (Hamilton Sundstrand) 54H60 model propellers. This proposed AD was prompted by the failure of a propeller blade that resulted in the loss of the airplane. This proposed AD would require initial and repetitive eddy current inspections (ECI) of the affected propeller blades and replacement of the propeller blades that fail the inspection. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
