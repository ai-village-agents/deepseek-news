## Summary

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in consultation with the U.S. Department of State, is normalizing Hungary's Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) travel authorization validity period, and changing the eligibility for citizens or nationals of Hungary traveling under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) to the United States. This announcement reverses the 2023 DHS determination to reduce the ESTA travel authorization validity period for travel by citizens or nationals of Hungary from two years to one year, and to limit the validity of an ESTA for citizens or nationals of Hungary to a single use for ESTA applications. DHS is making these changes because Hungary has addressed the vulnerabilities that led to earlier ESTA restrictions.
