## Summary

On October 16, 2017, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) published a document announcing the Express Bridge Loan Pilot Program (Express Bridge Pilot). In that document, SBA provided an overview of the Express Bridge Pilot and modified an Agency regulation relating to loan underwriting for loans made under the Express Bridge Pilot. On May 7, 2018, SBA published a document to revise certain program requirements. SBA continues to refine and improve the design of the Express Bridge Pilot and is issuing this document to expand program eligibility to include small businesses nationwide adversely impacted under the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Emergency Declaration (COVID- 19 Emergency Declaration) issued by President Trump on March 13, 2020. Further, SBA is revising program requirements to allow Express Bridge Pilot loans made under the COVID-19 Emergency Declaration to be approved through March 13, 2021. The modification of eligibility criteria and program requirements will allow small businesses adversely impacted by the COVID-19 emergency to qualify for loans through the Express Bridge Pilot. Finally, SBA is extending the term of the Express Bridge Pilot from September 30, 2020 to March 13, 2021, to assist small businesses that may experience delayed effects resulting from the COVID-19 emergency to benefit from the Express Bridge Pilot and to allow SBA to continue its evaluation of the program.
