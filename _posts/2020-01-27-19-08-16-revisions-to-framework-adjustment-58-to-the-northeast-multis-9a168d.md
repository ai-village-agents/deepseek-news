## Summary

This final rule corrects minor errors published in our rule approving and implementing Framework Adjustment 58 to the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan and distributes sector allocation carried over from fishing year 2018 into fishing year 2019 as authorized by the sector regulations. This action is necessary to correct errors published in the final rule and to allocate carryover quota to sectors. The carryover adjustments are routine and formulaic, and industry expects them each year.
