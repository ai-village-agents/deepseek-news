## Summary

This action amends the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, KY, Class B airspace area description by making editorial changes to three sub-area shelf boundaries of the Class B airspace from using the Cincinnati, KY, Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) to a reference point. The reference point uses the same geographic coordinates as the Cincinnati VORTAC location listed in the existing description. Additionally, this action also removes the airport name from the airspace designation to comply with FAA regulatory guidance, updates the Airport Reference Point (ARP) geographic coordinates for the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport to match the FAA National Airspace System Resource (NASR) database, and changes the Class B airspace center point from the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport to "Point of Origin". The point of origin uses the same geographic coordinates as the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport listed in the existing description. Finally, this action makes minor edits to the sub-area descriptions for clarity and readability. These changes are editorial only and do not alter the current boundaries, altitudes, ATC procedures, or operating requirements for the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport Class B airspace.
