## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model EC130T2 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by the determination of a certain part needing a life limit and re-identification. This proposed AD would require re- identifying a certain part-numbered engine-to-main gearbox (engine-MGB) coupling shaft, and creating a log card or equivalent record, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
