## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Helicopters Model AS350B, AS350B2, AS350B3, and AS350BA helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report that a modification of the electrical wiring of the hydraulic system was wrongly embodied on certain helicopters, and a wiring non-conformity caused the solenoid of the tail rotor (TR) load compensator to de-energize when the "HYD" cut-off switch was activated. This AD requires installing a placard in the cockpit, in full view of the pilots; a functional check of the main rotor (MR) and TR servo actuator solenoids, and corrective actions (modification) if necessary; a modification (unless already done); and, after corrective actions or modification, optional removal of the placard, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
