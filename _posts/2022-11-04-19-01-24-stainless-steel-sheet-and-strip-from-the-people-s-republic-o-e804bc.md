## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) have determined that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on stainless steel sheet and strip (SSSS) from the People's Republic of China (China) would be likely to lead to the continuation or recurrence of dumping, net countervailable subsidies, and material injury to an industry in the United States. Therefore, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation of these AD and CVD orders.
