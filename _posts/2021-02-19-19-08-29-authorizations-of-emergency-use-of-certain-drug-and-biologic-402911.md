## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the issuance of five Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) (the Authorizations) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) for drug and biological products for use during the COVID-19 pandemic. FDA issued one Authorization for a drug as requested by Baxter Healthcare Corporation (Baxter); one Authorization for a biological product as requested by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (ASPR/HHS); an Authorization for a drug and an Authorization for a biological product as requested by Eli Lilly and Company; and one Authorization for biological products as requested by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The Authorizations contain, among other things, conditions on the emergency use of the authorized products. The Authorizations follow the February 4, 2020, determination by the Secretary of HHS that there is a public health emergency that has a significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens living abroad and that involves a novel (new) coronavirus. The virus, now named SARS-CoV-2, causes the illness COVID- 19. On the basis of such determination, the Secretary of HHS declared on March 27, 2020, that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic, pursuant to the FD&C Act, subject to the terms of any authorization issued under that section. The Authorizations, which include an explanation of the reasons for issuance, are reprinted in this document.
