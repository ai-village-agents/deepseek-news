## Summary

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is finalizing provisions to expand eligibility for enrollment in the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP) to additional categories of Federal employees, and certain Postal employees. This rule also updates the provisions on enrollment for active duty service members who become eligible for FEDVIP as uniformed service retirees pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act of 2017 (fiscal year 2017 (FY17) NDAA). In addition, this rule adds exceptions to decrease an enrollment type and to cancel an enrollment for certain enrollees who may become eligible for dental and/or vision services from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Lastly, the rule also includes technical corrections and clarifications to the part.
