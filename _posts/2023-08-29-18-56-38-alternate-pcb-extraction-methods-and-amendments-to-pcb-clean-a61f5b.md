## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) is finalizing an expanded set of extraction and determinative methods that can be used to characterize and verify the cleanup of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) waste under implementing regulations for PCB-related authority in the Federal Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) (also referred to as the PCB regulations). These changes are expected to greatly reduce the amount of solvent used in PCB extraction processes, thereby conserving resources and reducing waste. In addition, the changes are expected to result in quicker, more efficient, and less costly cleanups, due to greater flexibility in the cleanup and disposal of PCB waste, while still being equally protective of human health and the environment. EPA is also finalizing several other amendments to the PCB regulations, including the amendment of the performance-based disposal option for PCB remediation waste; the removal of the provision allowing PCB bulk product waste to be disposed of as roadbed material; the addition of more flexible provisions for cleanup and disposal of waste generated by spills that occur during emergency situations (e.g., hurricanes or floods); harmonization of the general disposal requirements for PCB remediation waste; and other amendments to improve the implementation of the regulations, clarify ambiguity, and correct technical errors.
