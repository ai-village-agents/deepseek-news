## Summary

FMCSA revises the emergency exemption rules to narrow the scope of safety regulations from which relief is automatically provided for motor carriers and drivers providing direct assistance when an emergency has been declared. This rule ensures that the relief granted through emergency declarations is appropriate and tailored to the specifics of the circumstances and emergencies being addressed. This rule also revises the process for extending automatic emergency regulatory relief where circumstances warrant and allows for potential reporting requirements when FMCSA issues an extension or modification.
