## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is requesting comments on a regulatory basis to support a proposed rule that would amend the NRC's regulations for the licensing of new nuclear power reactors. The NRC's goals in amending these regulations would be to ensure consistency in new reactor licensing reviews, provide for an efficient new reactor licensing process, reduce the need for exemptions from existing regulations and license amendment requests, address other new reactor licensing issues deemed relevant by the NRC, and support the principles of good regulation, specifically openness, clarity, and reliability. The NRC plans to hold a public meeting to promote a full understanding of the rulemaking, discuss the regulatory basis, and facilitate public participation.
