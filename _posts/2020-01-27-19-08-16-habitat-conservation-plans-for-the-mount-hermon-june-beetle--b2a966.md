## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), have received two applications for an incidental take permit (ITP), one for the federally endangered Mount Hermon June beetle and one for the federally endangered Mount Hermon June beetle and Zayante band-winged grasshopper, under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. The County of Santa Cruz submitted a permit application that, if issued, would authorize take of the Mount Hermon June beetle incidental to otherwise lawful activities described in the draft habitat conservation plan for renovation of the County of Santa Cruz Juvenile Hall. Verizon Wireless submitted a permit application that, if issued, would authorize take of the Mount Hermon June beetle and Zayante band-winged grasshopper incidental to otherwise lawful activities described in the Verizon Wireless telecommunications facility expansion project draft habitat conservation plan. We invite public comment on these documents.
