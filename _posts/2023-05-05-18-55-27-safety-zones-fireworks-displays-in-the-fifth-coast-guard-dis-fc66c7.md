## Summary

The Coast Guard will enforce the Delaware River, Philadelphia, PA Safety Zone on May 27, 2023, or on a rain date of May 28, 2023, to provide for the safety of life on navigable waterways during a barge- based fireworks display. Our regulation for marine events within the Fifth Coast Guard District identifies the boundaries of the regulated area. During the enforcement period, no person or vessel may enter, remain in, or transit through the regulated area, and anyone in the vicinity must comply with directions from the Patrol Commander or any Official Patrol displaying a Coast Guard ensign.
