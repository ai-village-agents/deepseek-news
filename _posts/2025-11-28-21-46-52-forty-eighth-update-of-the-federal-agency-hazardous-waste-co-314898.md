## Summary

Since 1988, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has maintained a Federal Agency Hazardous Waste Compliance Docket ("Docket") under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). CERCLA requires EPA to establish a Docket that contains certain information reported to EPA by Federal facilities that manage hazardous waste or from which a reportable quantity of hazardous substances has been released. This document identifies the Federal facilities not previously listed on the Docket and identifies Federal facilities reported to EPA since the last update on April 21, 2025. In addition to the list of additions to the Docket, this document includes a section with revisions of the previous Docket list and a section of Federal facilities that are to be deleted from the Docket. Thus, the revisions in this update include two additions, zero deletions, and zero corrections to the Docket since the previous update.
