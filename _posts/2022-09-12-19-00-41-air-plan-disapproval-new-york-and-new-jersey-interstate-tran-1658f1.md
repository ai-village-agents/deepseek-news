## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) is disapproving State Implementation Plan (SIP) submissions from New York and New Jersey addressing interstate transport for the 2008 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). The "good neighbor" or "interstate transport" provision of the Clean Air Act (CAA) requires that each state's SIP contain adequate provisions to prohibit emissions from within the state from significantly contributing to nonattainment or interfering with maintenance of the NAAQS in other states. This requirement is part of the broader "infrastructure" requirements, which are designed to ensure that the structural components of each state's air quality management program are adequate to meet the state's responsibilities under the CAA.
