## Summary

FinCEN is issuing a final rule to specify when and how entities required to report beneficial ownership information to FinCEN may use a FinCEN identifier to report the beneficial ownership information of certain related entities. These regulations amend FinCEN's Beneficial Ownership Information Reporting Requirements Rule, which implements Section 6403 of the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA). The CTA was enacted into law as part of the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (AML Act), which is itself part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (NDAA).
