## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) adopts as final, without changes, a proposed rule to reinstate the exclusions on abortions and abortion counseling from the medical benefits package, which were removed in 2022. Before 2022, these exclusions had been firmly in place since the medical benefits package was first established in 1999. VA is also adopting as final, without changes, the reinstatement of exclusions on abortion and abortion counseling for the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA) that were also removed in 2022. VA takes this action to ensure that VA provides only needed and medically necessary and appropriate care to our nation's heroes and CHAMPVA beneficiaries.
