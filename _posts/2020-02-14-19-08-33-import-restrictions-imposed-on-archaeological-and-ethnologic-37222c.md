## Summary

This final rule amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regulations to reflect the imposition of import restrictions on certain archaeological and ethnological material from Ecuador. These restrictions are being imposed pursuant to an agreement between the United States and Ecuador that has been entered into under the authority of the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act. The final rule amends CBP regulations by adding Ecuador to the list of countries which have a bilateral agreement with the United States that imposes cultural property import restrictions. The final rule also contains the designated list that describes the types of archaeological and ethnological material to which the restrictions apply.
