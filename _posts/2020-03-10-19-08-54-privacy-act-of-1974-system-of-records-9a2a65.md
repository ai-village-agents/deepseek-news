## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to modify and reissue a current DHS system of records titled, "Department of Homeland Security/ALL-038 Insider Threat Program System of Records." This system of records allows DHS to establish capabilities to detect, deter, and mitigate insider threats. An "Insider" is defined to include any person who has or who had authorized access to any DHS facility, information, equipment, network, or system. An "insider threat" is the threat that an insider will use his or her authorized access, wittingly or unwittingly, to do harm to the Department's mission, resources, personnel, facilities, information, equipment, networks, or systems. DHS will use the system to facilitate management of insider threat inquiries; identify potential threats to DHS resources and information assets; manage referrals of potential insider threats to and from internal and external partners; provide authorized assistance to lawful administrative, civil, counterintelligence, and criminal investigations; and provide statistical reports and meet other insider threat reporting requirements.
