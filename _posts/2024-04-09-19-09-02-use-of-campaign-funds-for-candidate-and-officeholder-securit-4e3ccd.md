## Summary

The Federal Election Commission proposes to amend its regulations regarding the use of campaign funds to pay for security measures for federal candidates and officeholders. The proposed rule would codify several Commission advisory opinions that authorized the use of campaign funds to pay for certain security measures and address additional issues raised in those advisory opinions. The Commission seeks comment on the proposed rule and has made no final decision on the issues presented in this rulemaking.
