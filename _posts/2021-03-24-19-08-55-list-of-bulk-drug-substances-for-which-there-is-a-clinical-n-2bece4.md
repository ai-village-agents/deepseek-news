## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is developing a list of bulk drug substances (active pharmaceutical ingredients) for which there is a clinical need (the 503B Bulks List). Drug products that outsourcing facilities compound using bulk drug substances on the 503B Bulks List can qualify for certain exemptions from the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) provided certain conditions are met. This notice identifies one bulk drug substance that FDA has considered and proposes to include on the 503B Bulks List: Quinacrine hydrochloride ("quinacrine"). This notice identifies four bulk drug substances that FDA has considered and proposes not to include on the list: Bromfenac sodium, mitomycin-C, nepafenac, and hydroxychloroquine sulfate. Additional bulk drug substances nominated by the public for inclusion on this list are currently under consideration and may be the subject of future notices.
