## Summary

The Department of Transportation (DOT) is announcing its decision to terminate its rulemaking titled "Notifying Air Travelers of DOT's Aviation Consumer Hotline" (RIN 2105-AE83), which was previously listed in DOT's semiannual Regulatory Agenda. That rulemaking would have established a consumer complaints toll-free hotline telephone number and required airlines to display the number on their websites and at airports in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 42302, as amended by section 423 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-254). However, before DOT could complete a rulemaking, Congress enacted section 520 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 (Pub. L. 118-63), which eliminated the requirement from section 42302 that the Department establish the consumer complaints hotline telephone number. Consistent with the Administration's focus on reducing regulation and Congress' elimination of this requirement section 42302, DOT is terminating the proceeding.
