## Summary

The Department of Transportation (DOT) invites public comments on our intention to request Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for an information collection in accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The collection is necessary for administration of the Multimodal Project Discretionary Grants (MPDG). This includes three funding opportunities: the "National Infrastructure Project Assistance grants program (Mega)," the "Nationally Significant Multimodal Freight and Highways Projects grants program (INFRA)", and the "Rural Surface Transportation Grant program (Rural)". The MPDG provides Federal financial assistance for surface transportation infrastructure projects--including highway and bridge, intercity passenger rail, railway-highway grade and separation, wildlife crossing, public transportation, marine highway, and freight and multimodal projects, or groups of such projects, of national or regional significance, as well as to projects to improve and expand the surface transportation infrastructure in rural areas.
