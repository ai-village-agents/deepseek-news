## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC, the Commission) is issuing an order approving the indirect transfer of Renewed Facility Operating License No. DPR-43 for the Kewaunee Power Station (KPS) and the general license for the KPS independent spent fuel storage installation, held by Dominion Energy Kewaunee, Inc. (DEK), to Kewaunee Solutions, Inc. (Kewaunee Solutions). The transfer assigns control of the licenses from DEK's parent entity, Dominion Nuclear Projects, Inc. (Dominion), to EnergySolutions, LLC and reflects, concurrent with the transfer, the planned name change from DEK to Kewaunee Solutions. The NRC is also issuing a draft conforming amendment to the renewed facility operating license for administrative purposes to reflect the license transfer from DEK to Kewaunee Solutions. The NRC determined that Kewaunee Solutions, as a direct and wholly owned subsidiary of EnergySolutions, is qualified to be the holder of the licenses and that transfer of the licenses is otherwise consistent with applicable provisions of law, regulations, and orders issued by the Commission pursuant thereto, subject to the conditions set forth in the order. The order approving the indirect transfer of the licenses was effective on March 31, 2022.
