## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to deny the application from Matthew Killmer requesting an exemption from the hours-of-service (HOS) regulations to allow him to split his sleeper berth time into two 5- hour periods. The applicant indicates that the exemption would enable him to be a more alert and well rested commercial motor vehicle (CMV) operator and allow him to find a safe place to park his vehicle. FMCSA analyzed the application and public comments and determined that the exemption is not likely to achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent such exemption.
