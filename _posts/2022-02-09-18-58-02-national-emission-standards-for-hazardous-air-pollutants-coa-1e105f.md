## Summary

The EPA is proposing to revoke a May 22, 2020 finding that it is not appropriate and necessary to regulate coal- and oil-fired electric utility steam generating units (EGUs) under Clean Air Act (CAA) section 112, and to reaffirm the Agency's April 25, 2016 finding that it remains appropriate and necessary to regulate hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions from EGUs after considering cost. The Agency is also reviewing another part of the May 22, 2020 action, a residual risk and technology review (RTR) of Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS). Accordingly, in addition to soliciting comments on all aspects of this proposal, the EPA is soliciting information on the performance and cost of new or improved technologies that control HAP emissions, improved methods of operation, and risk-related information to further inform the Agency's review of the MATS RTR as directed by Executive Order 13990.
