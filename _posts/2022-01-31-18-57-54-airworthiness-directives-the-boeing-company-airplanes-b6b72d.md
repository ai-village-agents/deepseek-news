## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 737-8, 737-9, and 737-8200 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that radio altimeters cannot be relied upon to perform their intended function if they experience interference from wireless broadband operations in the 3.7-3.98 GHz frequency band (5G C-Band), and a recent determination that, during takeoffs and landings, as a result of this interference, certain airplane systems may not properly function, resulting in longer than normal landing or rejected takeoff distances due to the effect on thrust reverser deployment, spoilers, speedbrake deployment, and increased idle thrust, regardless of the approach type or weather. This AD requires revising the limitations and operating procedures sections of the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to incorporate limitations prohibiting the use of certain minimum equipment list (MEL) items, and to incorporate operating procedures for calculating takeoff and landing distances, when in the presence of 5G C-Band interference as identified by Notices to Air Missions (NOTAMs). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
