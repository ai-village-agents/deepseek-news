# Notice of Funding Opportunity for the Department of Transportation's Multimodal Project Discretionary Grant Opportunity

## Summary

The purpose of this notice is to solicit applications for three funding opportunities: The National Infrastructure Project Assistance grants program (Mega), the Nationally Significant Multimodal Freight and Highways Projects grants program (INFRA), and the Rural Surface Transportation Grant program (Rural). While applicants can choose to apply for only one grant program, this combined solicitation will allow applicants to apply for two, or all three of these funding opportunities by submitting only one application. It also aims to better enable the Department to proactively assist project sponsors in matching projects with the most appropriate grant program(s) and facilitate individual projects in potentially receiving funding from multiple grant programs. Funds for the INFRA, Mega, and Rural funding opportunities will be awarded on a competitive basis for surface transportation infrastructure projects--including highway and bridge, intercity passenger rail, railway-highway grade crossing or separation, wildlife crossing, public transportation, marine highway, and freight projects, or groups of such projects--with significant national or regional impact, or to improve and expand the surface transportation infrastructure in rural areas.
