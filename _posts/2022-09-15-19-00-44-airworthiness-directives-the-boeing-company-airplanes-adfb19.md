## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 747-100, 747-100B, 747-100B SUD, 747-200B, 747-200C, 747-200F, 747-300, 747SR, and 747SP series airplanes. This AD was prompted by significant changes, including new or more restrictive requirements, made to the airworthiness limitations (AWLs) related to fuel tank ignition prevention. This AD requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate the latest revision of the AWLs. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
