## Summary

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing a proposed regulation to clarify that bargaining-unit employees, who are detailed or temporarily promoted to higher grade duties of a higher-graded position, should be paid accordingly for the entire time performing these duties of a higher-graded position, when this action is pursuant to a final order by an arbitrator, adjudicative body, or court, under a collective bargaining agreement that provides for this action and the employees were assigned these duties outside of competitive hiring procedures. In addition, the proposed change clarifies that non- bargaining unit employees who are temporarily promoted to higher grade duties of a higher-graded position should be paid accordingly for the entire time performing these duties of a higher-graded position, as found pursuant to a final order by an adjudicative body or court. At present, non-competitive temporary promotions, and non-competitive details to duties of higher-graded positions are limited to no more than 120 days under OPM regulations regardless of the bargaining-unit status of the employee. Competitive procedures apply for any temporary promotion or detail to duties of a higher-graded position that exceeds 120-days, again, regardless of the bargaining-unit status of the employee.
