## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-18-05, which applies to all ATR-GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42-200, -300, and -320 airplanes; and AD 2020- 09-16, which applies to all ATR-GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42-200, -300, and -320 airplanes. AD 2018-18-05 and AD 2020- 09-16 require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2018-18-05 and AD 2020-09-16, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would retain the requirements of AD 2020-09-16. This proposed AD would also require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
