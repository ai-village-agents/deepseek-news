## Summary

This notice announces NMFS' receipt of an application and the public comment period for an exempted fishing permit (EFP) from the Alaska Seafood Cooperative. If issued, this permit would allow the applicant to test methods to minimize bycatch of halibut using an excluder device in the North Pacific's Amendment 80 flatfish fishery. The objective of this EFP, if issued, would be to develop a halibut excluder design that avoids high target species losses with more significant reductions in halibut bycatch. Field testing would be conducted between August 2021 and December 2022. This experiment would have the potential to promote the objectives of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.
