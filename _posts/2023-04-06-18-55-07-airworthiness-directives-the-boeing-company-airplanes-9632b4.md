## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 777-200, 777-200LR, 777-300, 777- 300ER, and 777F series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a "FLAPS DRIVE" caution message in flight due to the torque trip indicator of the No. 2 trailing edge (TE) flap transmission assembly being in the set position, which resulted in an air turn-back. This proposed AD would require an inspection or records review to determine the serial numbers of the TE flap transmission and gearbox assemblies, and applicable on-condition corrective actions. This proposed AD would also limit the installation of affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
