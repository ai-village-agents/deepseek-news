## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the National Labor Relations Board ("NLRB" or "Agency") proposes to issue a National Labor Relations Board system of records notice titled, "Backpay Management System" (NLRB-36). The Agency is authorized by the National Labor Relations Act to remedy unfair labor practices by issuing a backpay remedy to an individual, called a "discriminatee," for a monetary loss that results from an unfair labor practice. A charged party that owes backpay is generally referred to as a "respondent." The Agency uses the Backpay Management System (BMS) to record received funds from respondents, to effectuate disbursements of backpay and certain related tax forms to discriminatees, and to facilitate providing certain tax forms, tax reports, and tax payments to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Social Security Administration. This system notice will be included in the Agency inventory of record systems. All persons are advised that, in the absence of submitted comments considered by the Agency as warranting modification of the notice as here proposed, it is the intention of the Agency that the notice shall be effective upon expiration of the comment period without further action.
