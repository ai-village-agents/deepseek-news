## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) invites public comment on its Request for Information (RFI) number DE-FOA-0003052 regarding the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management's (FECM) Methane Mitigation Technologies and Point Source Carbon Capture research and development activities and regulation of natural gas imports and exports, under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, as amended. FECM is specifically interested in information on strategies and technologies that natural gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) companies are deploying or could deploy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollutants. This includes emissions of carbon dioxide (CO<INF>2</INF>), methane, criteria pollutants, and hazardous air pollutants that occur during production through transportation of natural gas delivered to a liquefaction facility; at liquefaction facilities; and during the loading, transport, and delivery of LNG to a regasification facility.
