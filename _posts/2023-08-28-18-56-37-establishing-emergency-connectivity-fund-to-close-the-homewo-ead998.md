## Summary

In this document, the Wireline Competition Bureau (Bureau) grants a petition for limited waiver of the Emergency Connectivity Fund (ECF) program's invoice filing deadline submitted by T-Mobile USA, Inc. (T-Mobile). The Bureau waives the Federal Communications Commission's (Commission) rules to provide an automatic, one-time extension of the invoicing filing deadline to October 30, 2023, for any funding requests with an invoice filing deadline date occurring before October 30, 2023. The Bureau finds that a one-time extension of the invoice filing deadline for applicants and service providers will provide them with sufficient flexibility to complete and submit their invoicing forms and necessary supporting documentation to the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) and the Bureau directs USAC to provide an automatic, one-time extension of the invoice filing deadline to October 30, 2023, for any funding requests with an invoice filing deadline occurring before October 30, 2023.
