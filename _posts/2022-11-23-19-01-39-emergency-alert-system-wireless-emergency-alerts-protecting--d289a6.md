## Summary

In this document, the Commission proposes requirements for Emergency Alert System (EAS) Participants to report compromises of their EAS equipment, communications systems, and services to the Commission. Additionally, this document proposes requirements for EAS Participants and Commercial Mobile Service (CMS) providers that participate in Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) to annually certify to having a cybersecurity risk management plan in place and to employ sufficient security measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their respective alerting systems. This document also proposes requirements for participating CMS providers to take steps to ensure that only valid alerts are displayed on consumer devices. These requirements would further protect the nation's communications systems from cybersecurity threats. With this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Commission seeks comment on the proposed rules and any suitable alternatives.
