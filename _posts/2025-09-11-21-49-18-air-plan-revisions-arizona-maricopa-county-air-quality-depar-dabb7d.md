## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing an approval of revisions to the Maricopa County Air Quality Department (MCAQD) portion of the Arizona State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern emissions of particulate matter from incinerators, burn-off ovens, and crematories. We are proposing to approve revisions to a local rule that regulates these emissions sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act"). We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
