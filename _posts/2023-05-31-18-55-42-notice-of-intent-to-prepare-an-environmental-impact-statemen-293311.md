## Summary

The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) intends to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on the Lower San Acacia Reach of the Middle Rio Grande. The project's goals are to increase water delivered to Elephant Butte Reservoir (EBR), maintain and enhance ecosystem health (such as protecting and promoting recovery of endangered species, minimizing river drying, and increasing available habitat), and increase the benefits of system maintenance actions by working with geomorphic trends of the river. Reclamation is seeking suggestions and information on the alternatives and topics to be addressed.
