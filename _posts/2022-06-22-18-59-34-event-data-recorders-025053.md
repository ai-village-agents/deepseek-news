## Summary

NHTSA is proposing to amend its regulations regarding Event Data Recorders (EDRs) to extend the EDR recording period for timed data metrics from 5 seconds of pre-crash data at a frequency of 2 Hz to 20 seconds of pre-crash data at a frequency of 10 Hz (i.e., increase from 2 samples per second to 10 samples per second). This NPRM begins the process of fulfilling the mandate of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act) to establish the appropriate recording period in NHTSA's EDR regulation.
