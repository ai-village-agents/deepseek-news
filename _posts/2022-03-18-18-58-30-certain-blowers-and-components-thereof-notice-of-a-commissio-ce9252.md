## Summary

Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has determined to bifurcate its review of Order No. 36 from its review of the EID in the enforcement proceeding. The Commission has determined to affirm the enforcement initial determination ("EID") issued on December 14, 2021, finding no violation of the consent order issued in the above-referenced section 337 enforcement investigation with the modifications set forth in the accompanying Commission opinion. The enforcement proceeding is terminated. The Commission has determined to remand Order No. 36 to the Administrative Law Judge ("ALJ") for issuance of a revised order regarding sanctions as set forth in the Commission remand order. The Commission will consider Order No. 36 in the separate sanctions proceeding.
