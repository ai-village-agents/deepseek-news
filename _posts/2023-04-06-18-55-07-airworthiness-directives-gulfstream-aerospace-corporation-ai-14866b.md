## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation Model GVII-G600 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a failure that occurred during flight testing of a Gulfstream Model GVII-G500 airplane, when the aircraft was configuring for a steep approach test point, the crew received a flap failure message that was a result of a disconnect of the left hand flap due to structural failure. This AD requires revising the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the instructions for continued airworthiness (ICA) or inspection program for the airplane to establish a life limit for certain left-hand and right-hand inboard flap yoke fittings. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
