## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain General Electric Company (GE) CF34-10E model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by a manufacturer investigation that revealed Teflon material in the A-sump oil strainer (strainer assembly) screen after several reports of in-flight shutdowns (IFSDs) and unscheduled engine removals (UERs). This AD requires initial and repetitive visual inspections of the strainer assembly screen. As a terminating action to the initial and repetitive visual inspections, this AD requires the replacement of the stationary oil seal at the No. 1 forward bearing. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
