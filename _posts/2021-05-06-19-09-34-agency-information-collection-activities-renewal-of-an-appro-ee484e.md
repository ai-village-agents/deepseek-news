## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FMCSA announces its plan to submit the Information Collection Request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review and approval, and invites public comment. FMCSA requests approval to renew an ICR, titled "Medical Qualification Requirements," and provides updated information for several of the information collections discussed. This ICR is needed to ensure that drivers, motor carriers, Medical Examiners (ME), and the States are complying with the physical qualification requirements of commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers. The information collected is used primarily to determine and certify driver medical fitness and must be collected in order for our highways to be safe.
