## Summary

Buying products with recycled content fosters the diversion of materials from the solid waste stream and promotes the use of these materials in the manufacture of new products, strengthening the United States' recycling system. Congress required the issuance of procurement guidelines in Section 6002 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Section 6002 requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) to designate items that are or can be made with recovered materials and to recommend practices for procurement of such items. EPA has designated 61 items in eight product categories in a Comprehensive Procurement Guideline (CPG) and has issued recycled- content recommendations and procurement specifications for these items in a series of Recovered Materials Advisory Notices (RMANs) published in the Federal Register. EPA last updated the CPG/RMANs in 2007. Today, the Agency is seeking comment concerning the list of CPG-designated items and recommendations issued in the associated RMANs.
