## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA or the Agency) has reviewed its employee-based small business size definitions (commonly referred to as "size standards") for North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) sectors related to Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction (Sector 21); Utilities (Sector 22); Manufacturing (Sector 31-33); Transportation and Warehousing (Sector 48-49); Information (Section 51); Finance and Insurance (Sector 52); Professional, Scientific and Technical Services (Sector 54); and Administrative and Support, Waste Management and Remediation Services (Sector 56) and proposes several changes. Specifically, SBA proposes to increase 150 and retain 282 employee-based size standards in those sectors. SBA also proposes to retain the current 500-employee size standard for Federal procurement of supplies under the nonmanufacturer rule. SBA's proposed revisions relied on its "Size Standards Methodology" (Methodology). SBA seeks comments on its proposed changes to size standards in the above sectors and the data sources it evaluated to develop the proposed size standards.
