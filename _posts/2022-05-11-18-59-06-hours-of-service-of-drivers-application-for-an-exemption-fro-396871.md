## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to grant Cleveland-Cliffs Steel, LLC (Cliffs), formerly known as ArcelorMittal Indiana Harbor, LLC, exemption from the hours of service (HOS) that allows its employee- drivers with commercial driver's licenses (CDLs) who transport scrap metal on two trucks between their production and shipping locations on public roads to work up to 16 hours per day and to return to work with less than the mandatory 10 consecutive hours off duty. The exemption is similar to the exemption that allows Cliffs' drivers transporting steel coils to work the same HOS schedule. Unlike the steel coil exemption, the scrap metal trucks comply with the heavy hauler trailer definition, height of rear side marker lights restrictions, tire loading restrictions, and the coil securement requirements in the FMCSRs.
