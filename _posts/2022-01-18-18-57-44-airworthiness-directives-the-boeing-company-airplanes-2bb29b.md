## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-23- 02, which applied to certain The Boeing Company Model 737-200, -200C, - 300, -400, and -500 series airplanes. AD 2017-23-02 required repetitive inspections, replacement, and applicable on-condition actions for certain fuselage crown skin panels. This AD was prompted by an evaluation by the design approval holder indicating that the fuselage crown skin panels are subject to widespread fatigue damage. This AD retains the actions in AD 2017-23-02, revises certain airplane configurations and inspection locations, and adds airplanes to the applicability. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
