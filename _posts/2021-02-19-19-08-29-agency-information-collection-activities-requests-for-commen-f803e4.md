## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on November 4, 2020. Organizations that desire to become or remain certified as air carriers or commercial operators are mandated to report information to the FAA. The information collected reflects requirements necessary under parts 135, 121, and 125 to comply with Federal Aviation Regulation part 119--Certification: Air Carriers and Commercial Operators. The FAA will use the information it collects and reviews to ensure compliance and adherence to regulations and, if necessary, to take enforcement action on violators of the regulations.
