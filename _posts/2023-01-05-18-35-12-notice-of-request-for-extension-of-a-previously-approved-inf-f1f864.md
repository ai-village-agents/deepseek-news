## Summary

This notice announces the intention of the U.S. International Trade Commission (Commission) to request a three-year extension, under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (the Act), of the current generic survey clearance that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) previously approved. The Commission uses this clearance to issue information collections for investigations that it is required to conduct under the Tariff Act of 1930, the Trade Act of 1974, and other trade-remedy statutes that require or authorize the Commission to make findings or determinations. The current generic survey clearance is assigned OMB Control No. 3117-0016; it will expire on June 30, 2023. The Commission requests comments concerning the proposed information collections under section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the Act; this notice describes such comments in greater detail in the supplementary information section below.
