## Summary

This action proposes to amend Class E airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth at Avenger Field Airport, Sweetwater, TX. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of an airspace review caused by the decommissioning of the Sweetwater non-directional radio beacon (NDB). The geographic coordinates for the airport and the name of the airport would be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database. Airspace redesign is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at these airports.
