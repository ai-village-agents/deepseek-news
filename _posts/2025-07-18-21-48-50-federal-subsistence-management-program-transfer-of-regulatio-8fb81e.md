## Summary

This rule transfers the Federal Subsistence Management Program regulations for the Department of the Interior from 50 CFR part 100 to 43 CFR part 51 to align with the transfer of the Office of Subsistence Management from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Policy, Management, and Budget. This rule also revises the program's regulations for both the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture to reflect the recent organizational changes and make administrative corrections.
