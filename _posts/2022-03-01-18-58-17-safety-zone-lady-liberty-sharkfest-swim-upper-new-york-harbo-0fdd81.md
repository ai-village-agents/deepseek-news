## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to establish a temporary safety zone on the navigable waters of Upper New York Bay, in the vicinity of Liberty Island, within a 100-yard radius of each swimmer during the Lady Liberty Sharkfest Swim on July 16, 2022. The safety zone is needed to protect the maritime public and event participants from the hazards associated with swim events taking place in a high vessel traffic area. Entry of vessels or persons into this zone is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port New York or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
