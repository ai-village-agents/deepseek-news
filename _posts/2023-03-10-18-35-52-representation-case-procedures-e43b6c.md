## Summary

The National Labor Relations Board (Board) is staying two provisions of its 2019 final rule ("Final Rule") amending its representation case procedures to account for new court decisions. The two provisions, which have never been in effect, are stayed until September 10, 2023. This stay is necessary to accommodate pending litigation over remaining challenges to the Final Rule and because the Board is currently considering whether to revise or repeal the Final Rule, including potential revisions to the two provisions.
