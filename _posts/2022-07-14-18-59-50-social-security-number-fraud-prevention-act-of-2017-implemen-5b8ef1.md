## Summary

The Department of the Interior (DOI) is publishing a direct final rule to promulgate regulations to implement the provisions of the Social Security Number Fraud Prevention Act of 2017. The new regulations will prohibit the inclusion of an individual's Social Security account number (SSN) on any document sent through the mail unless the Secretary of the Interior deems it necessary and precautions are taken to protect the SSN. The regulations also include requirements for the safeguarding of SSNs sent through the mail by partially redacting SSNs where feasible and prohibiting the display of SSNs on the outside of any package or envelope sent by mail. This rule is being published as a direct final rule as DOI does not expect any adverse comments. If adverse comments are received, this direct final rule will be withdrawn and a proposed rule for comments will be published.
