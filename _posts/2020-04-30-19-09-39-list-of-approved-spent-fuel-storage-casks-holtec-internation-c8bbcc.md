## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its spent fuel storage regulations by revising the Holtec International HI- STORM Flood/Wind Multipurpose Canister Storage System listing within the "List of approved spent fuel storage casks" to include Amendment No. 4 to Certificate of Compliance No. 1032. Amendment No. 4 revises the certificate of compliance to: Add multipurpose canister (MPC)-32ML for storage and allow the fuel assembly class 16x16D as content for MPC-32ML; add the fuel assembly class 16X16E as content for MPC-37; and make changes to the final safety analysis report to separate the design pressure for the short-term operation from the off-normal condition (to provide clarity in Table 2.2.1), add cautionary notes to Sections 9.2.1 and 9.2.3, update a definition, and replace a test program. These changes are discussed in more detail in the "Discussion of Changes" section of this direct final rule.
