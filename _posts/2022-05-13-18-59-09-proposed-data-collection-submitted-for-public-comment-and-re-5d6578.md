## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Resources and Services Database of the CDC National Prevention Information Network (NPIN). This information collection request is designed to support a resource for referrals, to facilitate partnerships and coordination among programs dealing with HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, STDs, and TB, and to satisfy the legislative mandate that information and education on HIV/AIDS be made available expeditiously and accurately to the professional community and to the general public.
