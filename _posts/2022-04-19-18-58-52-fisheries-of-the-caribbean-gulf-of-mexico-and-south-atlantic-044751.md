## Summary

NMFS corrects the final rule that implemented management measures described in the Comprehensive Ecosystem-Based Amendment 2 (CE-BA 2) to multiple fishery management plans (FMPs) of the South Atlantic Region, which published in the Federal Register on December 30, 2011. Among other measures, that final rule modified management in special management zones (SMZs) off South Carolina in the South Atlantic exclusive economic zone (EEZ). In that final rule, NMFS inadvertently applied recreational harvest and possession restrictions for certain species to the Ft. Pierce Offshore Reef SMZ, a pre-existing SMZ off the Florida east coast. The purpose of this correcting amendment is to fix that error.
