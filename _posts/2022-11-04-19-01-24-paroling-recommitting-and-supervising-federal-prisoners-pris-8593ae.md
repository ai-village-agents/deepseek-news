## Summary

The U.S. Parole Commission is modifying a rule that permits it to reopen a case and rescind a parole date when the prisoner has committed a violation of institutional rules. This modification will permit findings by a Residential Reentry Center's Disciplinary Committee, as well as findings by the Disciplinary Hearing Officer, as conclusive evidence of misconduct for the United States Parole Commission to rescind an established parole date.
