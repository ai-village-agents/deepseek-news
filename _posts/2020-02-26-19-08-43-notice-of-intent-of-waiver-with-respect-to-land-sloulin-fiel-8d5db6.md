## Summary

The FAA is considering a proposal to change 788.93 acres of airport land from aeronautical use to non-aeronautical use and to authorize the sale of airport property located at the former Sloulin Field International Airport, ISN, Williston, ND. The aforementioned land is not needed for aeronautical use because the new Williston Basin International Airport, XWA, Williston, ND is open and available for public aeronautical use. The former Williston Airport, ISN, site is located primarily on the west side of Highway 2, north of 26th Street in the City of Williston with 7.25 acres located on the east side of Highway 2. The airport's prior aeronautical use was for commercial and general aviation flying. The proposed non-aeronautical use of the property will be for commercial and residential development.
