# Tribal Transportation Facility Bridge Program

## Summary

This proposed rule would update the existing Tribal Transportation Program Bridge Program, formerly known as the Indian Reservation Road (IRR) Bridge Program, by renaming it the Tribal Transportation Facility Bridge Program (TTFBP) to comply with the changes made in the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), carried on through the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act, and the recent changes made by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), enacted as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). It would also remove references to terms such as structurally deficient, functionally obsolete, and sufficiency rating. These updates would align the TTFBP terminology for bridge conditions with the terminology used for State departments of transportation (State DOT) in the Federal-aid highway program. This change would establish a consistent terminology for classifying and referring to bridge conditions.
