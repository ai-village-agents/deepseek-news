## Summary

The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, conducts a pre-clearance consultation program to provide the general public and federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on proposed and/or continuing collections of information in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act. This pre-clearance consultation program helps to ensure that requested data can be provided in the desired format, reporting burden (time and financial resources) is minimized, collection instruments are clearly understood, and the impact of collection requirements on respondents can be properly assessed. The purpose of this Notice is to solicit comments about the proposed IMLS evaluation of four specific grant programs: The Native American Library Services: Basic Grants; Native American Library Services: Enhancement Grants; Native American/Native Hawaiian Museum Services; and Native Hawaiian Library Services. The purpose of the evaluation will be to determine how well the agency's grant-making aligns with the needs of communities served by these specific programs; to lay a foundation for improving the quality, reach, and impact of the agency's grant programs in the future; and to inform increasing organizational capacity of eligible applicants to submit high-quality grant applications and of awardees to successfully complete their award responsibilities. A copy of the proposed information collection request can be obtained by contacting the individual listed below in the ADDRESSES section of this Notice.
