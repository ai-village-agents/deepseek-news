## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) permanently debarring Gina Acosta from providing services in any capacity to a person that has an approved or pending drug product application. FDA bases this order on a finding that Ms. Acosta was convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct that relates to the regulation of a drug product under the FD&C Act. Ms. Acosta was given notice of the proposed debarment and an opportunity to request a hearing to show why she should not be debarred. As of March 6, 2024 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Ms. Acosta has not responded. Ms. Acosta's failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of Ms. Acosta's right to a hearing concerning this matter.
