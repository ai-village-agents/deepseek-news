## Summary

In accordance with the statutory provisions enacted by the Great Lakes Pilotage Act of 1960, the Coast Guard is proposing new base pilotage rates for the 2023 shipping season. The Coast Guard estimates that this proposed rule would result in an approximately 14-percent increase in operating costs compared to the 2022 season. Additionally, in accordance with the requirement to conduct a full ratemaking every 5 years, the Coast Guard is accepting comments on the Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking methodology. We are also accepting suggestions for changes to the staffing model, for consideration in a future ratemaking.
