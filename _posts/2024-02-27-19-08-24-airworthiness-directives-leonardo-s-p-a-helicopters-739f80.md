## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Leonardo S.p.a. Model AW189 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of an uncommanded deployment of the emergency life-raft system (ELS). This proposed AD would require a one-time inspection of the life-raft installations and, depending on the results, accomplishing additional actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
