## Summary

NMFS announces its intent to conduct 5-year reviews for black abalone (Haliotis cracherodii) and white abalone (H. sorenseni), both listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). NMFS is required by the ESA to conduct 5-year reviews to ensure that the listing classifications of species are accurate. The 5-year reviews must be based on the best scientific and commercial data available at the time. We request submission of any such information on black abalone and white abalone, particularly information on their status, threats, and recovery that has become available since the last 5-year reviews in 2018.
