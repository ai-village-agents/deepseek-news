## Summary

In June 2018, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) published a consumer product safety standard for baby changing products under section 104 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA). The standard incorporated by reference the 2018 ASTM International (ASTM) voluntary standard for baby changing products that was in effect at the time. The CPSIA sets forth a process for updating mandatory standards for durable infant or toddler products that are based on a voluntary standard, when a voluntary standards organization revises the standard. Consistent with the CPSIA update process, this direct final rule updates the mandatory standard for baby changing products to incorporate by reference ASTM's 2021 version of the voluntary standard.
