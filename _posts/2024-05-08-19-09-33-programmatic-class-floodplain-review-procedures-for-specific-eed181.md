## Summary

On October 4, 2023, FEMA published a notice requesting public comment on its determination that a programmatic/class review is appropriate for six categories of activities, in specific grant programs that do not have an adverse impact, individually or cumulatively, on floodplain values placing property and persons at risk. FEMA received no comments and is now publishing final notice of its determination in compliance with Federal regulations.
