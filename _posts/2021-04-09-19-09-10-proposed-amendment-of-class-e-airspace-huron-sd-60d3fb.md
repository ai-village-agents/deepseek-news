## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace at Huron Regional Airport, Huron, SD. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of an airspace review caused by the decommissioning of the Huron VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) navigation aid as part of the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program. The geographic coordinates of the airport would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
