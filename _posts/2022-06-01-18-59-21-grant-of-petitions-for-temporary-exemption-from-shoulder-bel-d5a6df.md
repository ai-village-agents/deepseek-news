## Summary

In accordance with the procedures in our regulations, NHTSA is granting 13 petitions from various final stage manufacturers (the petitioners) of motorcoaches for a temporary exemption from a shoulder belt requirement of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 208, "Occupant crash protection," for side-facing seats. This grant permits the petitioners to install Type 1 seat belts (lap belt only) at side-facing seating positions, instead of Type 2 seat belts (lap and shoulder belts). After reviewing the petitions and the comments received, the agency has determined that the requested exemption is warranted to enable the petitioners to sell a vehicle whose overall level of safety or impact protection is at least equal to that of a nonexempted vehicle.
