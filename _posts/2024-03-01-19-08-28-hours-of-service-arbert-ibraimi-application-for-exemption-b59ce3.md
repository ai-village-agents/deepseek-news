## Summary

FMCSA announces that it has received an application from Arbert Ibraimi to be exempt from the requirement that drivers of commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) use an electronic logging device (ELD) to record their hours of service (HOS). The applicant requests to use paper logs instead of an ELD for 12 months and asserts that because he is a new business operating as an owner-operator he cannot afford an ELD. FMCSA requests public comment on the applicant's request for exemption.
