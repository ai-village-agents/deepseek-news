## Summary

On April 1, 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) initiated the fifth sunset review of the antidumping duty (AD) orders on helical spring lock washers from the People's Republic of China (China) and Taiwan. Because no domestic interested party responded to the sunset review notice of initiation by the application deadline, Commerce is revoking the AD orders on helical spring lock washers from China and Taiwan.
