## Summary

FMCSA announces that it has received an application from Alaska's Ice Road Driving School requesting an exemption from the skills road test portion of the behind-the-wheel (BTW) entry-level driver training (ELDT) requirements for driver trainees. The applicant explains that because of the unique road system and challenging terrain in Alaska, it is difficult to adhere to the driver training regulations. The applicant futher explains that the road configurations lead to only a few major established safe road systems in Alaska. The applicant believes that the road skills test for a Commercial Driver's License (CDL) applicant can safely be administered by the state test examiner as set routes can be established and approved without the CDL applicant completing certain portions of the mandatory BTW training. FMCSA requests public comment on the applicant's request for exemption.
