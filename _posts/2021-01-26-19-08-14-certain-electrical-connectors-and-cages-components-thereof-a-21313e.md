Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on December 18, 2020, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of Amphenol Corp. of Wallingford, Connecticut.

The complaint, as supplemented, alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain electrical connectors and cages, components thereof, and products containing the same by reason of infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 7,371,117 ("the '117 Patent"); U.S. Patent No. 8,371,875 ("the '875 Patent"); U.S. Patent No. 8,864,521 ("the '521 Patent"); U.S. Patent No. 9,705,255 ("the '255 Patent"); and U.S. Patent No. 10,381,767 ("the '767 Patent").
