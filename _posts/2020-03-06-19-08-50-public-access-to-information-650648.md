## Summary

The Department of State (the Department) proposes to revise its regulations of May 6, 2016, governing the availability to the public of information that is under the control of the Department. There have been changes in the law governing disclosure of such information, including the Freedom of Information Act Improvement Act of 2016. This proposed rule reflects changes in the FOIA and consequent changes in the Department's procedures since the last revision of the Department's regulations on public access to information.
