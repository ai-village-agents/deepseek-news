## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Bell Textron Inc., Model 412, 412EP, and 412CF helicopters. This AD was prompted by evaluation results showing flight loads that impact the collective lever fatigue life. This AD requires adding a permanent hours time-in-service (TIS) penalty for certain collective levers and prohibits installing those collective levers unless the permanent hours TIS penalty has been added. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
