## Summary

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission or CPSC) is announcing the availability of, and seeking comment on, a report from SEA, Ltd. (SEA), "Study of Debris Penetration of Recreational Off-Highway Vehicle (ROV) Proof-of-Concept (POC) Floorboard Guards" (SEA Technical Report). This report is related to CPSC's notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) regarding off-highway vehicle debris penetration hazards. CPSC contracted with SEA to perform debris penetration tests on POC floorboard guards per the test methods described in the NPR. The SEA Technical Report also evaluates an alternative test method for debris penetration that is proposed in two draft voluntary standards. The SEA testing evaluates the effectiveness of the test methods in addressing the debris penetration hazard and the feasibility of the proposed requirements in the NPR.
