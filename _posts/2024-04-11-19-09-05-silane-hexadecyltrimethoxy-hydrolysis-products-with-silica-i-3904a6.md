## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of silane, hexadecyltrimethoxy-, hydrolysis products with silica (CAS Reg. No. 199876-45-4) when used as an inert ingredient (Pickering emulsion) on growing crops and raw agricultural commodities pre- and post-harvest at no more than 0.6% by weight of the pesticide formulation. Evonik Corporation, 299 Jefferson Road, Parsippany, NJ 07054 submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of silane, hexadecyltrimethoxy-, hydrolysis products with silica, when used in accordance with the terms of this exemption.
