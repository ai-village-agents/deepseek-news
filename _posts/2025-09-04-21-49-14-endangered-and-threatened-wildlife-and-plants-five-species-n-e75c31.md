## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce findings that five species are not warranted for listing as endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). After a thorough review of the best available scientific and commercial data available, we find that it is not warranted at this time to list the Jackson Prairie crayfish (Procambarus barbiger), Ozark shiner (Notropis ozarcanus), speckled burrowing crayfish (Creaserinus danielae), spiny scale crayfish (Cambarus jezerinaci), and spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata). However, we ask the public to submit to us at any time any new information relevant to the status of any of the species mentioned above or their habitats.
