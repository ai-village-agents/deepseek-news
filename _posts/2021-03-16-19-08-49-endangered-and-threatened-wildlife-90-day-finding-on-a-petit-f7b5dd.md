## Summary

We, NMFS, announce a 90-day finding on a petition to list Southern Oregon and Northern California Coastal (SONCC) spring-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) as a threatened or endangered Evolutionarily Significant Unit (ESU) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and to designate critical habitat concurrently with the listing. We find that the petition presents substantial scientific and commercial information indicating the petitioned action may be warranted. We will conduct a status review of SONCC spring-run Chinook salmon to determine whether the petitioned action is warranted. To ensure that the status review is comprehensive, we are soliciting scientific and commercial information pertaining to this species from any interested party.
