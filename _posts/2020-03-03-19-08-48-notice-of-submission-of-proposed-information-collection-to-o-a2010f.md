## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice announces the Department of Transportation's (Department) intention to renew and revise an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number as related to the Department's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) Form 251, Report of Passengers Denied Confirm Space. The Department has collected and published information regarding the industry's practice of overselling flights for over 40 years. In the past few years, there has been changes in the airline industry regarding how airlines handle oversale situations and denied boardings. For example, airlines have begun taking proactive steps to reduce the number of involuntary denied boardings including increasing the amount of compensation offered to passengers in exchange for voluntary changes to a passenger's itinerary. These changes have resulted in an overall reduction in the rate of denied boardings, but the practice still occurs and is an integral part of the airline industry. The Department is seeking to renew the current OMB control number and to revise and rename Form 251 to Form 250 to reduce the burden on airlines, better clarify the instructions for completing the form, and provide more relevant information to consumers.
