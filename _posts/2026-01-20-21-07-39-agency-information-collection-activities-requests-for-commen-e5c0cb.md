## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. This collection involves information voluntarily submitted through the FAA Noise Portal, which is used to respond to noise complaints and inquiries. The required fields in the Noise Portal represent the minimum information necessary for the FAA to respond effectively. In addition, it allows the FAA to prevent fragmented or delayed responses across FAA regions, enhances transparency and public trust, improves community engagement, and supports a centralized intake of noise complaints and inquiries. This voluntary data collection is essential for the FAA to fulfill its public engagement responsibilities, streamline operations, and uphold its commitment to responsive, citizen-centered governance.
