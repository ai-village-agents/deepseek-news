## Summary

Pursuant to section 4005(d) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) is proposing to deny the Alabama Department of Environmental Management's (ADEM or Department) Application for approval of the Alabama coal combustion residuals (CCR) permit program (Application). After reviewing the State CCR permit program Application submitted by ADEM on December 29, 2021, and additional relevant materials, and based on extensive discussions with ADEM regarding its Application, EPA has preliminarily determined that Alabama's CCR permit program does not meet the standard for approval under RCRA. This document announces that EPA is seeking comment on this proposal during a 60-day public comment period and will be holding an in-person public hearing on EPA's proposed denial of Alabama's CCR permit program.
