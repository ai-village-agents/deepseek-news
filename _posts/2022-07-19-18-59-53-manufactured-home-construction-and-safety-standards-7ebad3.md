## Summary

This proposed rule would amend the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards (the Construction and Safety Standards) by adopting the fourth and fifth group of recommendations made to HUD by the Manufactured Housing Consensus Committee (MHCC). This rule would also amend the Manufactured Home Procedural and Enforcement Regulations, the Model Manufactured Home Installation Standards and the Manufactured Home Installation Program regulations. The National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 (the Act), as amended by the Manufactured Housing Improvement Act of 2000, requires HUD to publish in the Federal Register any proposed revised Construction and Safety Standard submitted by the MHCC. The MHCC has prepared and submitted to HUD its fourth and fifth groups of recommendations to improve various aspects of the Construction and Safety Standards. HUD has reviewed those proposals and has made a number of editorial revisions to them. These recommendations are being published to provide notice of the proposed revisions and an opportunity for public comment.
