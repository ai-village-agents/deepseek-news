## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-15-52 which applied to various restricted category helicopters originally manufactured by Bell Textron Inc. with a certain main rotor hub strap pin (pin) installed. AD 2021-15-52 required removing certain outboard pins from service and prohibited installing them on any helicopter. This AD expands the applicability to all affected pins, regardless if they are outboard or inboard. This AD also requires inspecting the removed pin for any deformation and if it is deformed, removing the mating strap fitting (fitting) from service. This AD was prompted by the discovery that AD 2021-15-52 inadvertently limited its applicability to only outboard pins when, in fact, all pins are subject to the unsafe condition and the determination that a deformed pin may have damaged the fitting. Finally, this AD updates the current type certificate holder information as reflected in the type certificate data sheet (TCDS) and expands the applicability of AD 2021-15-52. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
