## Summary

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is modifying a system of records maintained by the Administration for Children & Families (ACF), 09-80-0327 ORR Repatriation Program Records, to reflect the change ownership of the repatriation program that was transferred to ACF's Office of Human Services Emergency Preparedness and Response (OHSEPR), and to broaden the scope of the system of records to include functionally similar records that OHSEPR uses to identify, assess, and address immediate unmet human services (i.e., social services) needs of survivors of federally-declared disasters in the United States. To reflect the transfer and broadened scope, HHS is changing the name of the system of records to OHSEPR Repatriation and Disaster Human Services Case Management Records.
