## Summary

The FAA is correcting an airworthiness directive (AD) that published in the Federal Register. That AD applies to certain Embraer S.A. (Embraer) Model EMB-505 airplanes. As published, two references to an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD in the preamble Background section are incorrect. This document corrects those errors. In all other respects, the original document remains the same.
