## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is amending its electronic import entries regulation to correct the statutory citation in the sections of that regulation requiring submission of the Drug Registration Number for human drugs and for animal drugs. The present revisions are necessary to correct editorial errors and to ensure that the codified cites the correct section of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). The electronic import entries regulation provides that the Drug Registration Number, which must be submitted at the time of entry in the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) or any other electronic data interchange (EDI) system authorized by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency (CBP), is the unique facility identifier specified in the FD&C Act. This rule does not impose any new regulatory requirements on affected parties. This action is editorial in nature and is intended to improve the accuracy of the Agency's regulations.
