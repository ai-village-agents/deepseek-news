## Summary

The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) is confirming the effective date of January 27, 2026, for the direct final rule "Rescission of Portions of Permanent Program Performance Standards Regulating Subsidence Controls for Underground Mines," published on November 28, 2025. The direct final rule lifts the suspension of the regulatory provision and revises the Federal regulations to remove paragraphs related to establishing a rebuttable presumption of causation for damage to any non-commercial building or occupied residential dwelling or structure related thereto that occurs as a result of earth movement within an area determined by projecting a specified angle of draw from the outermost boundary of any underground mine workings to the surface of the land. During the comment period, OSM received one substantive comment. That comment was not a significant adverse comment because it did not effectively challenge the rule's underlying premise or approach or explain why the rule would be inappropriate without a change. As a result, the comment does not warrant a delay of the effective date.
