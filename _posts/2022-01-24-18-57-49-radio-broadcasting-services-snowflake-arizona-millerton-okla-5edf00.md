## Summary

The Audio Division, on its own motion, proposes the deletion of seven vacant allotments in various communities in Arizona, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Vermont and Wyoming. We tentatively conclude that it is in the public interest to delete seven vacant allotments that have been offered in two FM auctions. No bids were entered for these allotments in the recently completed FM Auction 109. These permits are now considered unsold, and the allotments remain vacant. Deletion of these allotments may create other opportunities in nearby communities for new FM allotments or upgrades of existing stations. Therefore, we believe that the proposed deletion of these vacant allotments may promote a more effective and efficient use of the FM broadcast spectrum.
