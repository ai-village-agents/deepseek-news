## Summary

This action establishes two new low altitude RNAV routes, designated T-356, and T-358, in the northeastern United States. The new routes enhance the efficiency of the National Airspace System (NAS) by expanding the availability of RNAV routing and supporting the transition of the NAS from ground-based to satellite-based navigation. Originally, this docket action also proposed to establish routes T-303, T-307, T-320, T-324, and T-335. However, subsequent to the NPRM, the FAA determined that those routes require further development, so they will be addressed in separate docket actions at a later date.
