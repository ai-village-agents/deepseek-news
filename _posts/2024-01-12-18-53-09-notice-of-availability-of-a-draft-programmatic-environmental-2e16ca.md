## Summary

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) announces the availability of the draft programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) to analyze the potential impacts of wind energy development in six lease areas of the New York (NY) Bight. The PEIS also identifies possible changes in those impacts that could result from adopting certain avoidance, minimization, mitigation, and monitoring (AMMM) measures (the Proposed Action). This notice of availability (NOA) announces the start of the public review and comment period and the dates and times for public meetings on the draft PEIS. After the public comment period and meetings, BOEM will address the issues raised and will publish a final PEIS. The final PEIS will inform BOEM's decision whether to adopt certain AMMM measures at this stage that would potentially be required as conditions of approval for activities proposed by NY Bight lessees in their construction and operations plans (COPs) or defer the decision to adopt such measures to each project- specific environmental review.
