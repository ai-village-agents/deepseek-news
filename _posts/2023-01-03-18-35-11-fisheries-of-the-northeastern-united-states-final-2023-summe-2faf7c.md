## Summary

NMFS announces 2023 specifications for the summer flounder, scup, and black sea fisheries. The implementing regulations for the Summer Flounder, Scup, and Black Sea Bass Fishery Management Plan require us to publish specifications for the upcoming fishing year for each of these species. This action is intended to inform the public of the specifications for the start of the 2023 fishing year for summer flounder, scup, and black sea bass. This rule also implements a change to the regulations to facilitate states' participation in a Wave 1 (February) recreational black sea bass fishery.
