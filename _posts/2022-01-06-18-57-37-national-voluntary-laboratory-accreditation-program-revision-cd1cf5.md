## Summary

The National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) announces approval of revisions to its Personal Body Armor Laboratory Accreditation Program (LAP) for accreditation of laboratories performing tests on ballistic- and stab-resistant personal body armor. The program has been renamed as the Law Enforcement and Corrections Equipment LAP to better reflect the types of testing being performed within this accreditation program and to allow for future expansion of the program for testing of additional law enforcement and corrections equipment.
