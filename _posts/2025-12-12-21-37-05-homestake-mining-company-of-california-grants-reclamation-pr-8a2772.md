## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing an environmental assessment (EA) and a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) regarding a request from Homestake Mining Company (HMC) of California for approval of an amendment to NRC Materials License No. SUA-1471 to amend the cover design of the large tailings piles (LTP) to an evapotranspiration (ET) cover design at the Grants Reclamation Project (GRP) in Cibola County, New Mexico. If approved, HMC would use soil and rock material located on HMC-owned property to modify the final cover design for the LTP needed for decommissioning and reclamation of the site.
