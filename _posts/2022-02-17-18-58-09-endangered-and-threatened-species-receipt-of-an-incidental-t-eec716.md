## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), have received an application from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power for an incidental take permit under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. The permit would authorize take of the federally endangered California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) incidental to otherwise lawful activities associated with operation of the existing Pine Tree Wind Farm. We invite comments on the draft conservation plan and the draft environmental assessment, which we have prepared pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. We will take comments into consideration before deciding whether to issue an incidental take permit.
