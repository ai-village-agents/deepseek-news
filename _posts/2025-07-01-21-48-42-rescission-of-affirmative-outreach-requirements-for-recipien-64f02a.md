## Summary

The Department of Labor (Department), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management, Civil Rights Center (CRC), proposes to remove the regulations implementing the nondiscrimination and equal opportunity provisions of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) that contain affirmative outreach requirements for recipients of financial assistance under Title I of WIOA. WIOA does not authorize the Department to require affirmative outreach, therefore the Department is proposing to remove this requirement.
