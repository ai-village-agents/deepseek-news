## Summary

The Desert Southwest Region (DSW) of the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) is proposing an adjustment to the base charge and rates for fiscal year (FY) 2022 Boulder Canyon Project (BCP) electric service under Rate Schedule BCP-F10. The proposal would increase the base charge 9 percent from $65.4 million in FY 2021 to $71.3 million in FY 2022. The change is primarily the result of an increase in Bureau of Reclamation's (Reclamation) replacement costs, an increase in WAPA's operations and maintenance expenses and replacement costs, and a decrease in prior year carryover funds from FY 2021. The proposed base charge and rates would go into effect on October 1, 2021 and remain in effect through September 30, 2022. Publication of this Federal Register notice will initiate the public process.
