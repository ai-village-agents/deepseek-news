## Summary

NMFS is proposing to modify an incidental harassment authorization (IHA) that was issued to the United States Navy (Navy) on March 15, 2022 in association with construction activities related to the replacement of Pier 3 at Naval Station Norfolk in Norfolk, Virginia. As a result of necessary changes to the Navy's construction plan, NMFS is proposing to modify the Navy's IHA to increase authorized take by Level B harassment for bottlenose dolphins and take by Level A harassment for harbor seals. NMFS is also proposing to include appropriate, additional shutdown mitigation provisions for all species in the modified IHA. The monitoring and reporting measures remain the same as prescribed in the initial IHA. NMFS will also consider public comments on the requested modification prior to making any final decision and agency responses will be summarized in the final notice of our decision.
