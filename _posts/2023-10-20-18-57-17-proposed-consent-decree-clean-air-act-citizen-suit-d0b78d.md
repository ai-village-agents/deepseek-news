## Summary

In accordance with section 113(g) of the Clean Air Act, as amended ("CAA" or "the Act"), the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA" or "the Agency") is providing notice of a proposed consent decree in California Communities Against Toxics v. Regan, No. 1:22-cv- 1457 (D.D.C.). On May 24, 2022, California Communities Against Toxics, Clean Air Council, Clean Power Lake County, Delaware Concerned Residents for Environmental Justice, Greater-Birmingham Alliance to Stop Pollution, Kentucky Resources Council, New Castle Prevention Coalition, United Congregations of Metro-East, and Sierra Club (collectively, "Plaintiffs") filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that EPA failed to perform its non-discretionary duty to "review, and revise as necessary" the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants ("NESHAP") for Chemical Manufacturing Area Sources ("CMAS"), at least every 8 years. The proposed consent decree would establish deadlines for the EPA Administrator ("Administrator") to sign a notice of proposed rulemaking and a final rule for this action.
