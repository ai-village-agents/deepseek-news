## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC" or "Commission") is adopting a new rule under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") to increase the transparency and efficiency of the securities lending market by requiring certain persons to report information about securities loans to a registered national securities association ("RNSA"). The new rule also requires certain confidential information to be reported to an RNSA to enhance an RNSA's oversight and enforcement functions. Further, the new rule requires that an RNSA make certain information it receives, along with daily information pertaining to the aggregate transaction activity and distribution of loan rates for each reportable security, available to the public.
