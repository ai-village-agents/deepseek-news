## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Lockheed Martin Corporation/Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company Model 382, 382B, 382E, 382F, 382G, and 382J airplanes; and Model C-130A, HP- C-130A, EC-130Q, 282-44A-05 (C-130B), C-130B, and C-130H airplanes. This AD was prompted by the determination that certain aft fuselage sloping longerons may have been exposed to excessively hot forming temperatures for excessive amounts of time, which will reduce the mechanical properties of the longerons and affect their static strength. This AD requires, for certain airplanes, a records review to determine if a conductivity check has been performed on the longerons and to determine if the check was measured at least every four inches. This AD also requires, for certain airplanes, an inspection and applicable repairs. This AD also prohibits installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
