## Summary

On February 7, 2022, the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT or Court) issued its final judgment in Fine Furniture (Shanghai) Limited, et al. v. United States, Consol. Court No. 14-00135, sustaining the Department of Commerce (Commerce)'s remand redetermination pertaining to the 2011-2012 antidumping duty (AD) administrative review of multilayered hardwood flooring (wood flooring) from the People's Republic of China (China) covering the period May 26, 2011, through November 30, 2012.
