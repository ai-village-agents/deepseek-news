## Summary

The U.S. Department of the Army (Army) announces the availability of a Draft Legislative Environmental Impact Statement (Draft LEIS) regarding a requested public land withdrawal in the vicinity of Highway 95 and Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the LEIS analyzes the potential environmental effects resulting from the withdrawal and reservation for military purposes of approximately 22,000 acres of public land managed by the U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management (BLM). If enacted into law by Congress, the withdrawal would add acreage to Yuma Proving Ground (YPG). The Army requires the additional land as a safety buffer for testing advanced air delivery technologies and aviation systems. An LEIS is being prepared for this proposed action because the withdrawal and reservation require congressional action.
