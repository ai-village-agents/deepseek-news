## Summary

The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is amending the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to reflect changes to the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) Annex that were agreed to by MTCR member countries at the Technical Experts Meetings (TEMs) in March and November 2018, May and October 2019, and October 2021. This rule also expands the eligibility for the use of license exceptions under the EAR for MT-controlled items. These changes to license exception eligibility are also being made as part of a broader effort announced today that will liberalize several categories of export licensing requirements and the availability of export license exceptions for key allied and partner countries, as well as for members of certain multilateral export control regimes.
