## Summary

Consistent with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) policy interpretation for State Implementation Plan (SIP) provisions applying to excess emissions during periods of Startup, Shutdown and Malfunction (SSM) as outlined in EPA's 2015 SSM SIP Action, the EPA is proposing to reinstate its findings of substantial inadequacy and associated "SIP calls" that were withdrawn in 2020 for the states of Texas, North Carolina, and Iowa for SSM provisions in those states' SIPs that do not comply with statutory requirements and EPA's SSM Policy. The EPA is also proposing to issue new findings of substantial inadequacy and SIP calls to the state of Connecticut (CT); the state of Maine (ME); Shelby County, Tennessee (TN); the state of North Carolina (NC); Buncombe County, NC; Mecklenburg County, NC; the state of Wisconsin (WI); and the state of Louisiana (LA), for additional SSM provisions identified as deficient by the Agency.
