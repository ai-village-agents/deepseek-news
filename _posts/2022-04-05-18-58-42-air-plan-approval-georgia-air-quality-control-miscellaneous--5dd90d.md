## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving changes to the Georgia state implementation plan (SIP) submitted on behalf of the State of Georgia by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (GA EPD) through a letter dated September 1, 2020. This revision includes changes to the State's air quality regulations incorporated into the SIP by changing the definition of "pollution control project" and making minor changes to the corresponding minor new source review (NSR) permitting regulations for consistency. EPA is approving this SIP revision because the State has demonstrated that these changes are consistent with the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act).
