## Summary

This Request for public comment serves as a complementary document to the Economic Growth Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act: Implementation of National Standards for the Physical Inspection of Real Estate (NSPIRE) proposed rule. The proposed rule provided that HUD would publish in the Federal Register a set of NSPIRE inspection standards to consolidate and align housing quality requirements and associated inspection standards across programs. After developing and testing draft standards, HUD now seeks public review and comment on the proposed NSPIRE physical inspection standards which would accompany HUD's final rule. Additionally, HUD is proposing changes to the list of life-threatening conditions and incorporating them into the NSPIRE inspection standards in place of codifying the list which HUD proposed in the "Housing Opportunity Through Modernization Act (HOTMA) of 2016--Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) and Project Based Voucher Implementation: Additional Streamlining Changes" proposed rule. HUD will consider comments received in response to this request before publishing a final notice of standards in the Federal Register.
