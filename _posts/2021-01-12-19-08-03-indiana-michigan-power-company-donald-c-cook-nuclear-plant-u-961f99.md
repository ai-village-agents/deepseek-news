## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering issuance of an amendment to Renewed Facility Operating License No. DPR- 74, issued to Indiana Michigan Power Company (I&M), for operation of the Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant, Unit No. 2 (CNP-2). The proposed amendment would revise the CNP-2 technical specifications (TSs) to allow a one-time change to permit the current integrated leak rate test interval of 15 years to be extended by approximately 18 months to no later than the plant startup after the fall 2022 refueling outage.
