## Summary

The FAA has determined to extend through October 24, 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19)-related limited waiver of the minimum slot usage requirement at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), New York LaGuardia Airport (LGA), and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) that the FAA has already made available through May 31, 2020. Similarly, the FAA has determined to extend through October 24, 2020, its coronavirus-related policy for prioritizing flights canceled or otherwise not operated as originally intended at designated International Air Transport Association (IATA) Level 2 airports in the United States, for purposes of establishing a carrier's operational baseline in the next corresponding season. These IATA Level 2 airports include Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD), Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), and San Francisco International Airport (SFO). These extensions through October 24, 2020, are available on the same terms as the relief that the FAA already has announced through May 31, 2020.
