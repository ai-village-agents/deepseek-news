This action proposes to establish Area Navigation (RNAV) routes T-469 and T-472 in the southwest United States. The new RNAV routes would expand the availability of the enroute structure and provide additional RNAV routing within the National Airspace System (NAS) in support of transitioning it from ground-based to satellite- based navigation.
