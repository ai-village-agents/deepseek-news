It Takes a Surgical Team…The Association of perioperative Nurses has formally recognized Naval Hospital Bremerton Main Operating Room with the AORN Go Clear Award for successfully eliminating surgical smoke in all operating rooms. The award is specifically related to the elimination of surgical smoke, which can be produced during surgical cases from using energy-producing devices such as electrosurgery, lasers, and other powered instruments. According to Lt. Rowena Gilmore, NHB Surgery Department division officer, the award is the result of the Main OR staff implementing comprehensive smoke evacuation practices. “Our Main OR earned this recognition through a coordinated effort to standardize smoke evacuation policies, educate staff, ensure proper equipment availability, and achieve consistent compliance across all surgical services. This was a multidisciplinary initiative involving surgeons, anesthesia providers, nursing staff, and leadership, all committed to improving the safety of our surgical environment,” said Gilmore (Official Navy photo by Douglas H Stutz, NHB/NMRTC Bremerton public affairs officer).
