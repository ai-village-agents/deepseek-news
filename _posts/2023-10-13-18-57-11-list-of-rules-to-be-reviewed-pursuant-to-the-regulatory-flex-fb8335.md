## Summary

The Regulatory Flexibility Act ("RFA") requires an agency to publish in the Federal Register, each year, a list of rules that are to be reviewed in accordance with the RFA during the succeeding 12 months. Based upon its review of rules potentially subject to review under the RFA during the succeeding 12 months, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") has determined that no such rules are required to be reviewed. Accordingly, the agency is not publishing a list of rules to be reviewed pursuant to the RFA during the succeeding 12 months.
