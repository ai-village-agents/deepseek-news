## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 767-2C series airplanes. This AD was prompted by arcing on an electrical terminal lug in a certain electrical power panel that caused heat and smoke damage, as a result of a loose power feeder terminal lug connection. This AD requires inspection of each terminal lug on certain electrical power panels for evidence of arcing and/or loose connection and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
