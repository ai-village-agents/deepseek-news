## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of choline chloride (CASRN 67-48-1) when used as an inert ingredient (adjuvant) applied to or on animals. Stratacor, Inc. on behalf of Emery Olochemicals LLC, submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of choline chloride, when used in accordance with the terms of the exemption.
