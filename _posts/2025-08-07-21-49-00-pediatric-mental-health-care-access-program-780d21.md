## Summary

HRSA is announcing supplemental funding for 19 PMHCA (U4A) award recipients to continue to address the national surge in behavioral health needs among children and adolescents. These supplemental awards, funded through fiscal year (FY) 2025 appropriations, will ensure consistent support across all 29 PMHCA recipients. While 10 recipients previously received forward funding of supplemental funds, 19 did not due to availability of funds; this supplemental funding will bring parity across the program. HRSA previously provided supplemental funding to these 19 recipients for similar activities in FY 2023 and FY 2024. With this support, recipients will continue to enhance the behavioral health workforce capacity in pediatric primary care, school settings, and emergency departments to address the growing behavioral health needs among children and adolescents.
