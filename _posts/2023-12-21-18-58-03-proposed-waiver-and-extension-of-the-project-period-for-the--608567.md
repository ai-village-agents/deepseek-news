## Summary

The Secretary proposes to waive the requirements in the Education Department General Administrative Regulations that generally prohibit project periods exceeding five years and project period extensions involving the obligation of additional Federal funds. Under the proposed waiver and extension, for projects funded in fiscal year (FY) 2019 under the Tribally Controlled Postsecondary Career and Technical Institutions Program (TCPCTIP), Assistance Listing Number 84.245A, the project period would be extended through FY 2027, if Congress continues to appropriate funds under the existing program authority.
