## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission Act ("FTC Act"), the Federal Trade Commission ("Commission") is issuing the Non- Compete Clause Rule ("the final rule"). The final rule provides that it is an unfair method of competition for persons to, among other things, enter into non-compete clauses ("non-competes") with workers on or after the final rule's effective date. With respect to existing non-competes--i.e., non-competes entered into before the effective date--the final rule adopts a different approach for senior executives than for other workers. For senior executives, existing non-competes can remain in force, while existing non-competes with other workers are not enforceable after the effective date.
