## Summary

The FAA is withdrawing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all True Flight Holdings LLC Model AA-1, AA-1A, AA-1B, AA-1C, AA-5, AA-5A, and AA-5B airplanes. The NPRM was prompted by the report of an accident of an airplane with bondline corrosion and delamination of the horizontal stabilizers. The NPRM proposed to require inspecting the wings, fuselage, and stabilizers for bondline separation, corrosion, and previous repair. The NPRM also proposed to require repairing or replacing parts and applying corrosion inhibitor as necessary. Since issuance of the NPRM, the FAA has determined that there is not an unsafe condition, but instead incorrectly followed maintenance procedures. Accordingly, the NPRM is withdrawn.
