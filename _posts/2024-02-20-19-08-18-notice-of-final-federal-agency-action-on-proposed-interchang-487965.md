## Summary

This notice announces actions taken by FHWA and other Federal agencies that are final. This final agency action relates to a proposed interchange reconstruction and widening project, the I-285 at I-20 Interchange Reconstruction Project. Along I-20, the proposed project begins at the Thornton Road interchange eastbound I-20 on-ramp and ends at the Hamilton E. Holmes interchange for a total length of approximately 6.5-miles. Along I-285, the proposed project begins just south of the Martin Luther King (MLK) Jr. Drive interchange and extends north to the Donald Lee (DL) Hollowell Parkway interchange for a total length of approximately 2.4-miles. The FHWA's Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) provides details on the Selected Alternative for the proposed interchange and will be used by Federal Agencies in subsequent proceedings, including decisions whether to grant licenses, permits, and approvals for the highway project.
