## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2016-16-09 and AD 2019-03-20, which applied to Dassault Aviation Model FALCON 7X airplanes. Those ADs required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new and more restrictive maintenance requirements and airworthiness limitations for airplane structures and systems. This AD requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations; as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD was prompted by the FAA's determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
