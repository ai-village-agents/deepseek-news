## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Roben-Hood Airport, Big Rapids, MI. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of an airspace review caused by the cancellation and revision of the instrument procedures at this airport. The geographic coordinates of the airport would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautic database. Airspace design is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at this airport.
