## Summary

FHWA, FRA, and FTA are publishing this interim final rule (IFR) to modify the regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) that apply to all three agencies to be consistent with the removal of regulations previously issued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), the amendments to NEPA included in the section of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 known as the Building United States Infrastructure through Limited Delays and Efficient Reviews (BUILDER) Act of 2023, and amendments regarding efficient environmental reviews included in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021. This rule will become effective immediately while the agencies seek comment on what further changes may be appropriate.
