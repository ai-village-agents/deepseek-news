## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of fatty acids, tall-oil, esters with triethanolamine, ethoxylated (CAS Reg No. 68605-38-9) and fatty acids, C<INF>8-18</INF> and C<INF>18</INF>-unsatd., esters with polyethylene glycol ether with triethanolamine (3:1) (CAS Reg No. 2464873-19-4) (herein referred to 20ETO and 10ETO, respectively) when used as inert ingredients (surfactant) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops pre- and post-harvest, not to exceed 10% in the final pesticide formulation. Exponent, Inc. on behalf of Lamberti USA, Incorporated submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of 20ETO and 10ETO.
