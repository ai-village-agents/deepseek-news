## Summary

On December 20, 2023, the FDIC adopted a final rule that, among other things, amended the FDIC's official sign and advertisement of membership requirements for insured depository institutions (IDIs). The current compliance date for requirements related to displaying the official digital sign on IDIs' digital deposit-taking channels and automated teller machines (ATMs) and like devices is March 1, 2026. The FDIC is delaying the March 1, 2026, compliance date to January 1, 2027. This delay will provide certainty and minimize undue burden on IDIs while the FDIC completes consideration of a proposal to amend requirements related to digital deposit-taking channels and ATMs and like devices.
