## Summary

This rule establishes reductions in the annual registration fees the States collect from motor carriers, motor private carriers of property, brokers, freight forwarders, and leasing companies for the Unified Carrier Registration (UCR) Plan and Agreement for the registration years beginning in 2020. For the 2020 registration year, the fees will be reduced by 14.45 percent below the 2018 registration fee level to ensure that fee revenues collected do not exceed the statutory maximum, and to account for the excess funds held in the depository. The fees will remain at the same level for 2021 and subsequent years unless revised in the future. The reduction of the current 2019 registration year fees (finalized on December 28, 2018) range from approximately $3 to $2,712 per entity, depending on the number of vehicles owned or operated by the affected entities.
