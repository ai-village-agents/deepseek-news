## Summary

At the request of the Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (ACHDNC or Committee), HRSA is requesting input from the public on the process used by the Committee for nomination and evidence-based review of conditions that are considered for inclusion in the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP). As an entity that advises the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) based on evidence-based information, ACHDNC periodically considers and evaluates its processes. During the November 2023 meeting, ACHDNC hosted listening sessions to learn more from stakeholders regarding their views on the process used by ACHDNC for nomination and evidence-based review of conditions. In support of this work, HRSA is seeking public input on a series of questions that will help inform the nomination and review processes.
