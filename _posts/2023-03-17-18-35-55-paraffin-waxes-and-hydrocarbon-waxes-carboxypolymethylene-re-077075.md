## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of paraffin waxes and hydrocarbon waxes, carboxypolymethylene resin, and paraffin waxes and hydrocarbon, oxidized, lithium salts when used as inert ingredients (flow aid, surface protectant, binder, carrier, coating agent or adjuvant) on growing crops and raw agricultural commodities pre- and post-harvest, applied in/on animals, and in antimicrobial formulations applied to food-contact surfaces in public eating places, dairy-processing equipment, and food-processing equipment and utensils. Spring Regulatory Sciences, on behalf of Sasol Chemicals (USA) LLC, submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of paraffin waxes and hydrocarbon waxes, carboxypolymethylene resin oxidized paraffin wax, and paraffin waxes and hydrocarbon, oxidized, lithium salts, when used in accordance with the terms of those exemptions.
