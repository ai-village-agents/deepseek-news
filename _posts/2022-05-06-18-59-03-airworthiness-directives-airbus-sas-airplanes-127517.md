## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-03-12, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2018-03-12 requires repetitive rototest inspections for cracking of the fastener holes in certain door stop fittings, and repair if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2018-03-12, new analysis by the manufacturer resulted in optimized compliance times for the inspections. This proposed AD would require repetitive rototest inspections for cracking of the fastener holes in certain door stop fittings at revised compliance times, and corrective actions if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
