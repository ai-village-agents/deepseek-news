## Summary

Title 49 U.S.C. 47105(f) provides that every sponsor of an airport for which AIP funds are apportioned shall notify the Secretary, by such time and in a form prescribed by the Secretary, of its intent to submit a grant application for its available entitlement funds. This notice establishes the annual national deadline and requirements for every airport sponsor to signal their intent to submit applications for FY 2026 AIP entitlement funds. This is necessary to ensure the FAA has sufficient time to convert and carry over (protect) undeclared apportionment funds.
