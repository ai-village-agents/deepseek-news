## Summary

In this document, the Wireline Competition Bureau (Bureau) announces that a third application filing window for the Emergency Connectivity Fund (ECF) Program will open on Thursday, April 28, 2022, and close on Friday, May 13, 2022. The Bureau anticipates that a minimum of $1 billion will be available for commitment and disbursement for this third window. In view of outstanding demand, eligible schools and libraries may request funding during this 15-day filing window for a maximum of 12 months of eligible services and equipment that will be received or delivered between July 1, 2022, and December 31, 2023. Accordingly, the Bureau also modifies the Federal Communication Commission's (Commission) ECF rules to establish December 31, 2023, as the service delivery date for equipment, other non- recurring services, and recurring services requests submitted during the third application filing window.
