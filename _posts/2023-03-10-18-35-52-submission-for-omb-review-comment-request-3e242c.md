## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice announces and requests comments on the intention of the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) to request approval for the continuation of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Registration Form to Request Electronic Access Code information collection to allow USDA customers to securely and confidently share data and receive services electronically. Authority for obtaining information from customers is included in the Freedom to E-File Act, the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-SIGN), the E- Government Act of 2002, and the GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT. Customer information is collected through the USDA eAuthentication Service (eAuth), located at https://www.eauth.usda.gov. The USDA eAuth service provides both public citizens as well as Federal Government employees with a secure single sign-on capability for USDA applications, management of user credentials, and verification of identity, authorization, and electronic signatures. USDA's eAuth Service obtains customer information through an electronic self-registration process provided through the eAuth website. This voluntary online self- registration process and identity proofing process (either in-person at a USDA Service Center or online with national credit bureaus) enables USDA customers to obtain accounts as authorized users that will provide single sign-on capability, self-registration, and account management to access USDA Web applications and services via the internet.
