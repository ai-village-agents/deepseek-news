## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a component of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), announces the issuance of an Order requiring airlines and aircraft operators to collect designated information for passengers who are departing from, or were otherwise present in, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or the Republic of Guinea (Guinea) within 21 days prior to their entry or attempted entry into the United States. This Order is based on the CDC Director's determination that such passengers are at risk of exposure to Ebola virus and that their accurate and complete contact information is needed to protect the health of fellow travelers and United States communities.
