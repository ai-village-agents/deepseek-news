## Summary

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to receive input from the public on the barriers and challenges that prevent members of underserved communities (as defined in Executive Order 13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, and Executive Order 14091, Further Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government) from participating in NASA's procurements, grants, and cooperative agreements. With this RFI, NASA is seeking for the public to provide specific feedback on the procurement, grant, and cooperative agreement regulations, policies, practices, and processes that deter entities from pursuing opportunities for NASA procurements, grants, and cooperative agreements. NASA will review inputs received and may use this information to evaluate, implement, modify, expand, and streamline procurements, grants, cooperative agreements, regulations, policies, practices, and processes to remove systemic inequitable barriers and challenges facing members of underserved communities.
