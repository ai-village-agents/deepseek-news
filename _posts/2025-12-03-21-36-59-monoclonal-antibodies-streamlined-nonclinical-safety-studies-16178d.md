## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled "Monoclonal Antibodies: Streamlined Nonclinical Safety Studies." The draft guidance provides recommendations for streamlined approaches to assess long-term safety from monoclonal antibodies that recognize a single molecular target (referred to as monospecific antibodies); describes when general toxicology studies are not warranted or may be limited to a short-term study; and addresses reproductive, developmental, and juvenile toxicity assessments. When finalized, the guidance is intended to assist sponsors in avoiding unnecessary use of animals, particularly non-human primates (NHPs), in furtherance of the 3R principles of reducing, refining, and replacing the use of animal testing.
