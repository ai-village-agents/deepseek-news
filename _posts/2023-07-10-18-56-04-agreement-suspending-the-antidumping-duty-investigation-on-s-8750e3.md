## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) determines that the Agreement Suspending the Antidumping Duty Investigation on Sugar from Mexico, as amended (AD Agreement) met the statutory requirements during the period of review (POR) from December 1, 2020, through November 30, 2021. Commerce also determines that the respondents selected for individual examination, Ingenio Tala S.A. de C.V. and its affiliates (collectively, GAM Group) and Ingenio Tamazula S.A. de C.V. and its affiliates (Tamazula) (collectively, respondents) were in compliance with the terms of the AD Agreement during the POR. However, we determine that the respondents did not comply with the requirement to eliminate at least 85 percent of the dumping found in the investigation during the POR. Furthermore, we consider the respondents' noncompliant behavior to be serious and in need of remediation, and we will implement certain steps to address their noncompliance.
