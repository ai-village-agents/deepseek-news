## Summary

The Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties (OPCL), a component within the United States Department of Justice (DOJ or Department), is finalizing without changes its Privacy Act exemption regulations for the system of records titled, Data Protection Review Court Records System, JUSTICE/OPCL-001, which were published as a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on May 23, 2023. The notice for this new system of records, Data Protection Review Court Records System, JUSTICE/OPCL-001, was also published in the Federal Register on May 23, 2023. Specifically, the Department's regulations will exempt this system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act to protect national security and law enforcement sensitive information, preserve judicial independence, and ensure the integrity of adjudicatory records in cases before the Data Protection Review Court (DPRC). The Department received no comments on the NPRM.
