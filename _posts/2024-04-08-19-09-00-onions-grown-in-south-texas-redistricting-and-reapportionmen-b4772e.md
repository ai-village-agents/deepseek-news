## Summary

This proposed rule invites comments on implementing a recommendation from the South Texas Onion Committee (Committee) to reestablish the districts in the production area and reapportion representation on the Committee. This rulemaking would reduce the number of districts from two to one and reapportion membership to reflect changes in the industry, provide equitable representation on the Committee, and create the opportunity for more producers and handlers to serve on the Committee.
