## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Leonardo S.p.a. Model AW169 helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of a protruding pushbutton screw (screw) on a cockpit door internal handle resulting in an interference with the collective stick travel. This AD requires inspecting each screw and depending on the results, modifying the cockpit door handle and reporting information, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also prohibits installing an affected door handle assembly unless certain actions are accomplished. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
