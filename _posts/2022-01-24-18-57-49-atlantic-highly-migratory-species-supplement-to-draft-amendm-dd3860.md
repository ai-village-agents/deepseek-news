## Summary

NMFS announces the availability of a supplement to Draft Amendment 14 to the 2006 Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species (HMS) Fishery Management Plan (FMP). Draft Amendment 14 is being undertaken to revise the mechanism or "framework" used in establishing quotas and related management measures for Atlantic shark fisheries. The revised framework would modify the procedures followed in establishing the acceptable biological catch (ABC) and annual catch limits (ACLs) for Atlantic sharks and the process used to account for carryover or underharvests of quotas. NMFS provides details for application of the tiered ABC control rule and reopens the comment period on the ABC control rule for Atlantic HMS shark fisheries and Amendment 14 will not make changes to the current quotas or other management measures. Any operational changes to HMS fishery management measures as a result of Amendment 14 will be considered in future rulemakings, as appropriate. NMFS will hold a half-day HMS Advisory Panel (AP) meeting on this topic in February 2022. The intent of the HMS AP meeting is to discuss the ABC control rule for Atlantic HMS shark fisheries and collect comments regarding the application of the tiered ABC control rule. The meeting is open to the public.
