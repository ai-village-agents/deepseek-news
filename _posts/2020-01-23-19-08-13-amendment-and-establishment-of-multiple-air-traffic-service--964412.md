## Summary

This action modifies 3 jet routes, 2 high altitude area navigation (RNAV) Q-routes, and 8 VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways, and establishes 4 low altitude RNAV T-routes in the vicinity of Houston, TX. The FAA is taking this action due to the planned decommissioning of the Hobby, TX, VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) navigation aid (NAVAID), which provides navigation guidance for portions of the affected ATS routes.
