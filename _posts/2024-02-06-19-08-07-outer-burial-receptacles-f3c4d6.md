## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes to revise its regulation that governs the outer burial receptacle (OBR) monetary allowance for burials in a VA national cemetery when a privately purchased OBR is used in lieu of a Government-furnished graveliner. First, VA proposes to expand applicability of the monetary allowance to burials in VA grant-funded State and Tribal cemeteries when a privately purchased OBR was used, or where an OBR is placed at the time of interment, at the cost of the State or Tribal Organization. Second, VA proposes to reimburse States and Tribal Organizations for OBRs that are pre-placed as part of a new construction or expansion grant project. In addition, VA proposes minor conforming revisions to its regulations governing aid for the establishment, expansion and improvement of veterans cemeteries to clarify that VA will reimburse the cost of preplaced OBRs separately from the grant award. These changes would implement new authorities provided in the Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2020. VA also proposes to amend the regulation governing OBRs by removing retroactive provisions no longer needed because the relevant time period has passed.
