## Summary

In this rule, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by adding four entities under nine entries to the Entity List. These entities are listed under the destinations of Costa Rica (1), Ecuador (1), India (1) Panama (2), Spain (1), Russia (1), and Venezuela (2). These entities have been determined by the U.S. Government to be acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. Some entities are added under multiple entries, accounting for the difference in the totals.
