## Summary

On June 29, 2023, the Department of Education (Department) published in the Federal Register a notice of a new system of records titled "FUTURE Act System (FAS)" (18-11-23). The Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE Act) amended the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to authorize the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service (IRS), to disclose to the Department certain Federal tax information (FTI) of an individual, upon approval being provided by the individual to the Department, for the purpose of determining eligibility for, or repayment obligations under, Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), with respect to loans under part D of title IV of the HEA, and determining eligibility for, and amount of Federal student financial aid under, a program authorized under subpart 1 of part A, part C, or part D of title IV of the HEA. The Department and the IRS have entered into a computer matching agreement (CMA) pursuant to which the IRS will disclose FTI to the Department, to maintain and secure the FTI obtained in this system. We are correcting the comment due date and the effective date of the routine uses listed in the system of records notice. All other information in the system of records notice remains the same.
