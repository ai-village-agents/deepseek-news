## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Dassault Aviation Model FALCON 7X airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of a weak point identified in the Falcon 7X `EASy' avionics architecture, which, coupled with theoretical generic input/output (I/ O) card failure, could lead to misleading data on display units. This AD requires revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to provide emergency procedures for inconsistent or unreliable flight data and emergency and abnormal operations procedures for the GEN I/O internal module failure, and revising the operator's existing FAA- approved minimum equipment list (MEL) items for the multi-function probe heating, air data, and inertial reference systems, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also requires revising the existing AFM to incorporate additional information in the emergency procedures. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
