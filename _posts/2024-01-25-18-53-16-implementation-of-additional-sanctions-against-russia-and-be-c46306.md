## Summary

In response to the Russian Federation's (Russia's) ongoing aggression against Ukraine and Belarus's complicity in the invasion, the Department of Commerce is strengthening its existing sanctions under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) against Russia and Belarus, including by expanding the scope of the EAR's Russian and Belarusian Industry Sector Sanctions and making certain changes to the licensing requirements that apply to the occupied Crimea region of Ukraine as well. Additionally, this rule revises recent restrictions targeting Iran's supply of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles to Russia. This rule also refines certain existing export controls on Russia and Belarus. The Department of Commerce is taking these actions to enhance the effectiveness of its controls on these countries and to better align them with those implemented by U.S. allies and partners.
