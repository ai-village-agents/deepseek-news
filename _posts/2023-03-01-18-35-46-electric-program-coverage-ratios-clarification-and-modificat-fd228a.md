## Summary

The Rural Utilities Service (RUS), a Rural Development (RD) agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), is issuing a final rule with comment. The intent of this rule is to modify its coverage ratio requirements, add an additional set of ratios, and update and add definitions. The effect of this action is to reduce the regulatory impact on RUS Electric Program borrowers, ensure that loan funds will be repaid in the time agreed upon, facilitate the lending for construction of rural electric infrastructure, and allow RUS to focus on feasibility and security issues while increasing customer efficiency, customer satisfaction and service.
