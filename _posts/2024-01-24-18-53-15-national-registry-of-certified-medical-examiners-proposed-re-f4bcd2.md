## Summary

FMCSA proposes to remove medical examiners (ME) from its National Registry who have failed to access their National Registry account using login.gov and have failed to update the profile information in their National Registry account as required. Since June 2018, by using the email, physical address, and telephone number these MEs provided to the Agency in their National Registry account, FMCSA has attempted to notify them of the requirement to access their account using login.gov. There are approximately 15,727 MEs who have not accessed their National Registry account using login.gov and as a result, are not able to fulfill regulatory requirements such as reporting results of physical qualification examinations performed on commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers, receiving FMCSA communications, and completing required training. MEs who are removed from the National Registry will no longer be certified to perform physical qualification examinations of CMV drivers. To avoid being removed from the National Registry, MEs to whom this notice applies must complete the corrective actions set forth below. A list of MEs subject to this notice is provided in the docket for this proceeding.
