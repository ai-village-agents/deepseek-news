## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is announcing the placement of the Mississippi Agreement State Program (Mississippi Program) for the regulation of certain Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, materials on Probation. The NRC is further increasing its oversight of the Mississippi Program and will oversee implementation of a Program Improvement Plan developed by the Mississippi Program's staff. The NRC Chairman notified the Governor of Mississippi of this decision in a letter dated September 26, 2022. Depending on the progress of the Agreement State in meeting the commitments in the Program Improvement Plan and demonstration of significant and sustained improvements in program performance, the Management Review Board (MRB) Chair will make a recommendation to the Commission on the probationary status. The NRC will make further announcements regarding the status of the Mississippi Program, as appropriate.
