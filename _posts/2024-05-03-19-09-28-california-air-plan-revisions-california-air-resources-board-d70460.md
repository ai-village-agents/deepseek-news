## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to a California statewide rule and six California air district rules into the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act). These revisions concern emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from crude oil and natural gas facilities. Based on our proposed finding that these revisions correct previously-identified deficiencies in these rules, we are now proposing to fully approve the reasonably available control technology (RACT) requirement for the 2008 and 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for sources covered by the EPA's 2016 Control Techniques Guidelines for the Oil and Natural Gas Industry ("2016 Oil and Gas CTG") for the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD), San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District (SJVUAPCD), Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (VCAPCD), and the Yolo-Solano Air Quality Management District (YSAQMD). We are also proposing to conditionally approve the RACT requirement for the 2008 and 2015 ozone NAAQS for sources covered by the EPA's 2016 Oil and Gas CTG for the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD). We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
