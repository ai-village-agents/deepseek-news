## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a revision to North Dakota's State Implementation Plan (SIP) which it received on November 11, 2016. The revision was submitted by the North Dakota Department of Health (NDDH) in response to EPA's finding of substantial inadequacy and SIP call published on June 12, 2015 for a provision in the North Dakota SIP related to excess emissions during startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) events. EPA is finalizing approval of the SIP revision and finds that the SIP revision corrects the deficiency identified in the June 12, 2015 SIP call.
