## Summary

Under the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (NDAA), coastal States (including Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands, and American Samoa), Indian Tribes (as defined in the final guidance), and other entities may form new partnerships and apply to NOAA (as delegated) for designation as a regional ocean partnership (ROP). ROPs coordinate the management of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes resources. After inviting Tribal consultation and careful consideration of public comments, NOAA announces the final guidance on designating new ROPs under the NDAA.
