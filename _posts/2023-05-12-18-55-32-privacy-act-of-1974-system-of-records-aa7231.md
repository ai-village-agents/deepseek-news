## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, the Office of External Affairs of the Corporation for National and Community Service (operating as AmeriCorps) proposes to establish a new system of records titled "CNCS-05-OEA-SNPE Social Network and Public Engagement System of Records." This system of records allows AmeriCorps to maintain information that individuals share voluntarily with AmeriCorps when they engage in activities promoted by AmeriCorps or interact with AmeriCorps via social networks channels. It also allows AmeriCorps to retain individuals' user account information, when login is required for access to the services provided by AmeriCorps' websites.
