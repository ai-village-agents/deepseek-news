## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the Maricopa County Air Quality Department (MCAQD) portion of the Arizona State Implementation Plan (SIP). This revision clarifies definitions used in a rule that limits volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions from petroleum solvents used in dry cleaning. We are proposing to approve the rule revisions under the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act"). We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
