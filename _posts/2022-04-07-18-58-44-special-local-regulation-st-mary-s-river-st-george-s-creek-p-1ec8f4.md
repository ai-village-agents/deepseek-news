## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish temporary special local regulations for certain waters of the St. Mary's River. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters located at Piney Point, MD, during a high-speed power boat demonstration event on June 4, 2022, and June 5, 2022. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the regulated area unless authorized by the Captain of the Port, Maryland-National Capital Region or the Coast Guard Event Patrol Commander. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
