## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model AS-365N2, AS 365 N3, EC 155B, EC155B1, SA- 365N, and SA-365N1 helicopters. This AD was prompted by reports of loss of tightening torque between the upper ball bearing end and the main rotor (MR) servo-control. This AD requires inspecting the tightening torque and, depending on the results, taking corrective action. This AD also requires reporting information. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
