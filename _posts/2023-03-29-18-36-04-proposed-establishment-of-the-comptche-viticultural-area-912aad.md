## Summary

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to establish the 1,421.8-acre "Comptche" American viticultural area (AVA) in Mendocino County, California. The proposed AVA is located entirely within the boundaries of the existing North Coast AVA, but the petitioner requests excluding the proposed AVA from the North Coast AVA due to significant differences in distinguishing features. TTB designates viticultural areas to allow vintners to better describe the origin of their wines and to allow consumers to better identify wines they may purchase. TTB invites comments on these proposals.
