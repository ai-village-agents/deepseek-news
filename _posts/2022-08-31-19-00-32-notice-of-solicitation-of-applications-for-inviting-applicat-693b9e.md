## Summary

The Rural Business-Cooperative Service (Agency), an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) invites applications for loans and grants under the Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Programs (REDLG or Programs) for fiscal year (FY) 2023, subject to the availability of funding. This notice is being issued prior to the passage of a FY 23 Appropriations Act, which may or may not provide funding for this program, to allow applicants sufficient time to leverage financing, prepare and submit their applications, and give the Agency time to process applications within FY 2023. Successful applications will be selected by the Agency for funding and subsequently awarded to the extent that funding may ultimately be made available through appropriations. An announcement on the Agency website at https://www.rd.usda.gov/newsroom/federal-funding-opportunities will identify the amount received in the FY 23 appropriations.
