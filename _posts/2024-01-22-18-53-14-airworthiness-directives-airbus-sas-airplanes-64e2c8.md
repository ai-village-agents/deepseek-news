## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-20-08, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A318, A319, A320, A321, A330-200, A330-200 Freighter, A330-300, A330-800, A330-900, A340- 200, A340-300, A340-500, A340-600, and A380-800 series airplanes. AD 2021-20-08 requires replacing certain parts manufacturer approval (PMA) nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) batteries with serviceable Ni-Cd batteries. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-20-08, it was determined that the on-wing preservation procedures originally provided in the service information did not ensure the expected preservation of the battery capacity. This proposed AD would add airplanes to the applicability and require replacement of certain affected parts with serviceable parts as a precondition for return to service of airplanes from storage or parking, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
