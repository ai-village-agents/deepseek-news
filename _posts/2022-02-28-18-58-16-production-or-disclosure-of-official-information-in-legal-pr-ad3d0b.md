## Summary

We are revising our regulations regarding the production or disclosure of official information in legal proceedings (referred to as Touhy regulations). These regulations are being updated to promote consistent processing of Touhy requests among U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA or Department) agencies; clarify the responsibilities of all parties in the Touhy process; and provide additional information about criteria that USDA agencies should consider in the Touhy process.
