The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the New York State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the purposes of implementing control of air pollution for volatile organic compounds (VOC). The proposed SIP revision consists of amendments to regulations outlined within New York's Codes, Rules, and Regulations that implement control measures for architectural and industrial maintenance coatings. The intended effect of this action is to approve control strategies which will result in VOC emission reductions that will help attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards for ozone. These actions are being taken in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act.
