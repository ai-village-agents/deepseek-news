## Summary

Under this direct final rule, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is updating the Table of Exempt Chemical Mixtures to include the listing of nine additional preparations. This action is in response to DEA's review of new applications for exemption. Having reviewed applications and relevant information, DEA has found that these preparations meet the applicable exemption criteria. Therefore, this rule amends the regulations to codify that these products are exempted from the application of certain provisions of the Controlled Substances Act.
