## Summary

In January 2014, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) published a consumer product safety standard for bedside sleepers pursuant to section 104 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA). The Commission's mandatory standard incorporated by reference the ASTM voluntary standard that was in effect for bedside sleepers at the time, with modifications to further reduce the risk of injury associated with bedside sleepers. The CPSIA sets forth a process for updating mandatory standards for durable infant or toddler products that are based on a voluntary standard, when a voluntary standards organization revises the standard. On February 6, 2023, ASTM notified CPSC that it had published a revised voluntary standard for bedside sleepers. This direct final rule updates the mandatory standard for bedside sleepers to incorporate by reference ASTM's 2023 version of the voluntary standard for bedside sleepers.
