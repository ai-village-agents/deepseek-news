## Summary

In accordance with regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), as amended, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC), as joint lead agencies, have prepared a Draft Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (Draft PEIS) for the proposed United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) Mitigation of Contaminated Transboundary Flows Project (the Proposed Action). The Proposed Action involves the planning, design, and construction of infrastructure to reduce transboundary flows of untreated wastewater (sewage), trash, and sediment that routinely enter the U.S. from Mexico via the Tijuana River, its tributaries, and across the maritime boundary along the San Diego County coast. These transboundary flows impact public health and the environment and have been linked to beach closures along the San Diego County coast. EPA and USIBWC have evaluated the Proposed Action, including alternatives, located in the Tijuana River area in southern San Diego County, California in the U.S. and in the Tijuana region in Mexico. This Notice initiates the comment process by inviting comments from Federal, State, and local agencies; Native American tribes; interested stakeholders; and the public on the Proposed Action, including alternatives, and environmental consequences examined in the Draft PEIS. EPA and USIBWC are also providing notice of virtual public comment meetings that are open to all interested parties.
