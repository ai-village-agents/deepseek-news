## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all ATR--GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR72 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of the main landing gear (MLG) rear hinge pin being ruptured. This AD requires replacing affected parts and prohibits the installation of affected parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference (IBR). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
