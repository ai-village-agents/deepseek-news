## Summary

On June 14, 2010, the Department of Education (Department) published in the Federal Register a final rule amending the Department's Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) regulations. The 2010 final rule implemented amendments made to the FOIA statute and clarified how the Department processes FOIA requests for agency records. We are correcting the administrative exhaustion provisions related to the Appeals of Adverse Determinations section in the FOIA regulations. All other provisions in the FOIA regulations remain the same.
