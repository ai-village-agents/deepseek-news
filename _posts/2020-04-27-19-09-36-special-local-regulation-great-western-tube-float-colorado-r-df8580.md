## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to change the location of the special local regulation for the annual Great Western Tube Float, which is held on the navigable waters of the Colorado River in Parker, AZ. The change of the location for the special local regulation is necessary to provide for the safety of life on the navigable waters during the event. This action will restrict vessel traffic in certain waters of the Colorado River, from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. one Saturday in June, from Buckskin Mountain State Park to La Paz County Park. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
