## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or "Agency") is notifying the public that the Agency has found motor vehicle emissions budgets ("budgets") adequate in a California state implementation plan (SIP) submittal for the San Joaquin Valley. Specifically, our finding relates to budgets in the area's "Attainment Plan Revision for the 1997 Annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> Standard" ("15 [mu]g/m\3\ SIP Revision"), submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) on November 8, 2021. We find that these budgets are adequate for transportation conformity purposes for the 1997 annual fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). Upon the effective date of this notice of adequacy, the San Joaquin Valley metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) and the U.S. Department of Transportation must use these adequate budgets in future transportation conformity determinations. Furthermore, once the San Joaquin Valley MPOs have used the adequate budgets to demonstrate conformity of their transportation plans to the 15 [micro]g/m\3\ SIP Revision, the conformity freeze put in place as of December 27, 2021, will be lifted.
