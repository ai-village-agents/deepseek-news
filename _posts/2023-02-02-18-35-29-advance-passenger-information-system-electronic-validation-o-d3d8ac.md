## Summary

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regulations require commercial air carriers to electronically transmit passenger information to CBP's Advance Passenger Information System (APIS) prior to an aircraft's departure to the United States from a foreign port or place or departure from the United States so that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can determine whether the carrier must conduct an additional security analysis or security screening of the passengers. CBP proposes to amend these regulations to incorporate additional commercial carrier requirements that would enable CBP to determine whether each passenger is traveling with valid, authentic travel documents prior to the passenger boarding the aircraft. The proposed regulations would also require commercial air carriers to transmit additional data elements through APIS for all commercial aircraft passengers arriving, or intending to arrive, in the United States in order to support border operations and national security and safety. Additionally, this proposal includes changes to conform existing regulations to current practice. Finally, the proposed regulations would allow commercial carriers to transmit an aircraft's registration number to CBP via APIS. This proposed rule is intended to increase the security and safety of the international traveling public, the international air carrier industry, and the United States.
