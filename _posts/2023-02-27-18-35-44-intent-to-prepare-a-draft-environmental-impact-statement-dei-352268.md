## Summary

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Wilmington District, Wilmington Regulatory Field Office has received a request for Department of the Army (DA) authorization, pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbor Act, from the Town of North Topsail Beach to construct a terminal groin and its associated oceanfront fillet placement along approximately 2,000 linear feet of oceanfront shoreline. Additionally, the installation of the terminal groin will be conjunction with the existing May 27, 2011, DA authorization that permitted the Town to relocate the New River Inlet ebb tide channel, conduct maintenance events within the channel, and perform a phased beach nourishment along approximately 11 miles of oceanfront shoreline. The DA authorization for the maintenance operation expires on December 31, 2041. The main purpose of adding the terminal groin is to provide additional shoreline protection of the Town's infrastructure, specifically along the northeastern end of island.
