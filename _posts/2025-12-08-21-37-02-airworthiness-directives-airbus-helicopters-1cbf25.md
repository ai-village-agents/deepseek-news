## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-06- 12, which applied to certain Airbus Helicopters Model AS 332L2 and EC 225LP helicopters. AD 2020-06-12 required determining the accumulated hours time-in-service (TIS) of certain part-numbered main gearbox (MGB) suspension bar attachment bolts (bolt) and certain part-numbered MGB suspension bar attachment fittings (fitting), applying a life limit add-on factor, and inspecting the torque of certain MGB suspension bar attachment nuts (nuts). Since the FAA issued AD 2020-06-12, the manufacturer developed a design improvement, and the FAA determined that modifying the helicopter is necessary. This AD retains the actions required by AD 2020-06-12 and requires the modification of the MGB suspension bar, inspection of the torque, and corrective actions. This AD also allows credit for the initial service life calculations if certain requirements are met and prohibits installing a certain bolt after the modification is accomplished on any helicopter. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
