# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model AS-365N2, AS 365 N3, EC 155B, EC155B1, SA-365N, and SA-365N1 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of loss of tightening torque between the upper ball bearing end and the main rotor (MR) servo-control. This proposed AD would require inspecting the tightening torque and, depending on the results, taking corrective action. This proposed AD would also require reporting information. These actions are specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
