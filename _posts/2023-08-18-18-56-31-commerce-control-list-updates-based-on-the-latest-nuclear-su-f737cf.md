## Summary

The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) publishes this final rule to amend the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to reflect changes reached by the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) in its June 2019 plenary meeting in Nur-Sultan (now Astana), Kazakhstan and its plenary meeting of June 2022 in Warsaw, Poland. Consistent with U.S. commitments as a participating country in the NSG, this rule revises five existing Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs) under the Commerce Control List (CCL). These changes protect U.S. nuclear nonproliferation interests, while aligning the EAR with the control text agreed to by participating governments (PGs).
