## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the Texas (TX) State Implementation Plan (SIP) proposed January 29, 2020 and submitted for parallel processing by the State on January 30, 2020. The proposal amends certain air quality permitting rules located in Title 30 of the Texas Administrative Code (TAC), Section 116, Control of Air Pollution by Permits for New Construction or Modification. These revisions amend the State's New Source Review permitting regulations via the addition of new, proposed Section 116.118, Construction While Permit Application Pending. This proposed new section will allow applicants for certain permit amendments to begin construction after the executive director has completed a technical review and issued a draft permit including the permit amendment for public review and comment, i.e., prior to final permit issuance. Non-substantive, administrative-type, editorial changes, such as grammar, re-lettering, and reference revisions and/or corrections are also included in the revisions the EPA is proposing for approval.
