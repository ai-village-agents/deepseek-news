## Summary

In 2022, the Commission issued a proposed rule seeking to amend the "primary management official" and "key employee" definitions; add definitions for "Gaming Enterprise" and "Tribal Gaming Regulatory Authority" (TGRA); and establish modern retention requirements for background investigations and licensing applications. The rule proposed vesting revocation hearing rights upon license issuance as well as in accord with tribal law, regulation or policy along with augmenting revocation decision notification and submission requirements. This revised proposed rule results from comments received. It permits tribes to designate and document other gaming enterprise employees as key employees and other employed gaming enterprise management officials as primary management officials, including TGRA personnel. Now such designations may occur by any documentary means. Updates to the key employee definition include custodians of gaming supplies and gaming operation employees authorized by the gaming operation for unescorted access to secure gaming areas, not vendors or other outside parties. The primary management official definition, however, now is narrower with the removal of individuals who have authority to supervise key employees of the gaming operation.
