## Summary

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is amending its rules of practice and procedure to codify the agency's longstanding practice of having certain adjudicative functions performed by an inferior officer of the United States appointed by the FDIC's Board of Directors (Board). Additionally, the FDIC is making other technical edits to its rules of practice and procedure to update references to certain positions within the FDIC Legal Division whose titles are outdated.
