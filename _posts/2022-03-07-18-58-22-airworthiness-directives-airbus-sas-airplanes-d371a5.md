## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-16- 01, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A318, A319, A320, and A321 series airplanes. AD 2020-16-01 required repetitive cleaning and greasing of affected cargo door seals (both original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and parts manufacturer approval (PMA) parts). This AD was prompted by reports of low halon concentration in the forward and aft cargo compartments due to air leakage through cargo compartment door seals, and the FAA's determination that improved cargo door seals must be installed and that certain flight operations must be limited until the improved cargo door seals are installed. This AD retains certain actions required by AD 2020-16-01 and requires replacing certain forward and aft cargo compartment door seals with new seals and installing a placard on the cargo compartment doors; and for certain airplanes, revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to implement an operational limitation for certain routes. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
