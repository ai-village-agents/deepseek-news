## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for navigable waters of the Savannah River, within a 500-yard radius around M/V BIGLIFT BAFFIN. The safety zone is needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards created by the transit through the Savannah River to Georgia Port Authority Garden City Terminal Berth No. 1 while carrying large cranes, and for the offload of those cranes to the facility. Entry of vessels or persons into this zone is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port Savannah or a designated representative.
