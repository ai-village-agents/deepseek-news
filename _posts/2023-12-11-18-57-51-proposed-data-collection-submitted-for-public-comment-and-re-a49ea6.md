## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Characteristics of Cases of Priority Fungal Diseases. These case report forms (CRFs) collect information on patient demographics, underlying conditions, diagnosis, treatments, healthcare utilization, and outcomes of patients with coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, Candida auris, triazole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus infection or colonization, or antifungal-resistant dermatophytosis.
