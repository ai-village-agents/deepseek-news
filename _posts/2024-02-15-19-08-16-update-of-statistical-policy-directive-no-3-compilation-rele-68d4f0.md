## Summary

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) announces the adoption of a revised Statistical Policy Directive No. 3: Compilation, Release, and Evaluation of Principal Federal Economic Indicators (Directive No. 3). The procedures in Directive No. 3, published in 1985, were designed to ensure equitable, policy-neutral, and timely release and dissemination of Principal Federal Economic Indicators. The goals of Directive No. 3 remain sound; this Notice announces the adoption of procedures consistent with these goals to reflect advances in communication technologies and methods. OMB has solely modified the provision, "employees of the Executive Branch shall not comment publicly on the data until at least one hour after the official release time," by replacing "one hour" with "thirty minutes." This change reduces the delay after official release time before commentary from employees of the Executive Branch, while retaining a necessary time delay between policy-neutral release of the official statistics and subsequent Executive Branch interpretations of this statistical data.
