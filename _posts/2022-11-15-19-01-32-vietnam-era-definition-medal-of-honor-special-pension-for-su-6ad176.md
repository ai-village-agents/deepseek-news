## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) amends its adjudication regulations by revising the definition of the Vietnam era, extending the payment of Medal of Honor special pension to an eligible surviving spouse, and extending eligibility for dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) to surviving spouses who remarry after age 55. These amendments incorporate legislative updates enacted by the Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2020. Amendments to regulations regarding the definition of Vietnam era and the retention of eligibility to DIC benefits following the remarriage of a surviving spouse after a certain age bring federal regulations into conformance with the statutory changes. Similarly, the Medal of Honor special pension regulatory amendments extend eligibility for that benefit to a surviving spouse of a Medal of Honor recipient as required by law.
