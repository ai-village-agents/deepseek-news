## Summary

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission or CPSC) has determined preliminarily that there is an unreasonable risk of injury and death, particularly to children, associated with clothing storage units (CSUs) tipping over. To address this risk, the Commission proposes a rule addressing the stability of CSUs. Specifically, the proposed rule would require CSUs to be tested for stability, exceed minimum stability requirements, be marked and labeled with safety information, and bear a hang tag providing performance and technical data about the stability of the CSU. The Commission issues this proposed rule under the authority of the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA). The Commission requests comments about all aspects of this notice, including the risk of injury, the proposed requirements, alternatives to the proposed rule, and the economic impacts of the proposed rule and alternatives.
