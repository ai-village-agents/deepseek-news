## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) amends the test procedures for refrigerated bottled or canned beverage vending machines (BVMs) to reference the latest version of the industry standard, while maintaining certain provisions specified in the current DOE test procedure. DOE also provides setup instructions for non-beverage shelves, updates the lowest application product temperature definition and test instructions, specifies setup instructions for refrigeration leak mitigation controls, and removes the obsolete test procedure.
