# Airworthiness Directives; General Electric Company Engines

## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain General Electric Company (GE) Model CF6-80E1A2, CF6-80E1A3, CF6-80E1A4, and CF6-80E1A4/B engines. This AD was prompted by a manufacturer investigation that revealed that a certain forward outer seal and certain high-pressure turbine rotor (HPTR) stage 1 disks and rotating seals were manufactured from material suspected to contain iron inclusion, which may cause reduced material properties and a lower fatigue life capability. This AD requires the replacement of the affected forward outer seal, HPTR stage 1 disks, and rotating seals. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
