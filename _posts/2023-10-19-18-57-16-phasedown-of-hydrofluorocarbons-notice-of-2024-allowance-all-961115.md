## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued calendar year 2024 allowances for the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons in accordance with the Agency's regulations. This issuance of allowances is undertaken pursuant to the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act, which directs the Environmental Protection Agency by October 1 of each calendar year to determine the quantity of production and consumption allowances for the following calendar year. In this notice, the Agency is also providing notice of separate Agency actions finalizing administrative consequences for certain entities. These administrative consequences were applied to withhold, retire, and revoke entities' remaining calendar year 2023 and newly issued calendar year 2024 allowances in accordance with the administrative consequence regulatory provisions.
