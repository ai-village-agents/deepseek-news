## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") proposes to amend the test procedures for consumer boilers to incorporate by reference the latest version of the industry standards currently referenced in the Federal test procedure. DOE proposes to relocate the test procedure in a new appendix separate from the residential furnace test procedure. DOE also proposes to remove an extraneous definition from its regulatory definitions. DOE is seeking comment from interested parties on the proposal.
