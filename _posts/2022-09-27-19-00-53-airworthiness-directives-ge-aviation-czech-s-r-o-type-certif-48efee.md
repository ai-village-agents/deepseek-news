## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain GE Aviation Czech s.r.o. (GEAC) M601D-11, M601E-11, M601E- 11A, M601E-11AS, M601E-11S, M601F, H75-100, H75-200, H80, H80-100, H80- 200, H85-100, and H85-200 model turboprop engines. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of cracks in dilution tube weld areas of the combustion chamber outer liner. This proposed AD would require initial and repetitive borescope inspections (BSIs) of the dilution tube weld areas of the combustion chamber outer liner and, depending on the results of the inspections, replacement of the combustion chamber outer liner with a part eligible for installation. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
