## Summary

The Administration for Community Living (ACL) announces the intent to award a single-source supplement to the current cooperative agreement held by the National Council on Aging for the Strengthening the Direct Care Workforce: A Technical Assistance and Capacity Building Initiative. The administrative supplement for FY 2023 will be in the amount of $1,974,846, bringing the total award for FY 2023 to $3,269,466. The supplement will provide sufficient resources to enable the grantee and their partners to increase funding for technical assistance (TA) to state aging and disability partnerships to collaborate with workforce entities to strengthen the Direct Care Workforce (DCW). The funding will enable the grantee to support additional states, including at more robust levels than originally planned. The funding will also enable additional work to strengthen the self-direction workforce by identifying gaps in knowledge and highlighting best practices to support and sustain those who self- direct, for dissemination via the DCW resource hub to a national audience.
