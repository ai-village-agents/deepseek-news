## Summary

This action proposes to modify the Class E airspace area extending upward from 700 feet above the surface (Class E5 700-foot airspace area) at Lihue Airport (LIH), Lihue, HI; Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL), Honolulu, HI; and Ellison Onizuka Kona International Airport, Keahole (KOA), Kailua-Kona, HI, by adding an additional layer of Class E5 airspace extending upward from 1,200 feet above the surface. This proposed addition of controlled airspace would comply with international airspace treaty provisions and satisfy the State of Hawaii's domestic airspace requirements. Additionally, this action proposes to remove the existing Class E5 airspace area that currently encompasses the Hawaiian Islands and extends beyond 12 miles from the shoreline into international airspace. This proposed action would further modify the Class E4 airspace area designated as an extension to a Class D or Class E surface area at KOA and remove the Class E4 airspace area at LIH. These actions support the safe and efficient management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at airports within the Hawaiian Islands.
