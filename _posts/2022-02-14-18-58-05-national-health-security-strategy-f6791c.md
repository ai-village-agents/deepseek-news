## Summary

The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is soliciting public comment regarding national health security threats, challenges, and promising practices to help inform the development of the 2023-2026 National Health Security Strategy (NHSS). Since 2006, Congress has required the Secretary of HHS to develop and submit a 4-year NHSS and implementation plan that describe "potential emergency health security threats and identify the process to be prepared to identify and respond to such threats." The quadrennial NHSS is a key U.S. Government vehicle for advancing public health and medical emergency capabilities, and serves as a tool to address priority threats, measure progress, identify gaps, and focus action to implement national health security capabilities.
