## Summary

This action amends Jet Routes J-82 and J-94, RNAV route Q-122, and VOR Federal airways V-100, V-138, V-456, and V-505; and removes VOR Federal airway V-462 and the Fort Dodge, IA, Domestic Low Altitude Reporting Point. This action is necessary due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Fort Dodge, IA, VOR/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC), which provides navigation guidance to portions of the affected Air Traffic Service (ATS) routes. The Fort Dodge VOR is being decommissioned as part of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (VOR MON) program.
