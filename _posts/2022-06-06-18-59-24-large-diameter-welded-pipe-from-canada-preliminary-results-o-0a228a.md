## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping duty (AD) order on large diameter welded pipe (welded pipe) from Canada. The period of review (POR) is May 1, 2020, through April 30, 2021. The review covers 46 producers or exporters of the subject merchandise including the sole mandatory respondent, Evraz. We preliminarily determine that Evraz made sales of subject merchandise at prices below normal value (NV) during the POR. We are also rescinding this administrative review for 42 companies for which this review was initiated. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.
