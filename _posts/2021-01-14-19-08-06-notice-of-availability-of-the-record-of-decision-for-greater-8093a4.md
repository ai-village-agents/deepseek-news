## Summary

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) announces the availability of the Record of Decision (ROD) for the management of Greater Sage- Grouse habitat in Utah. The BLM has determined that its decade-long planning and NEPA processes have sufficiently addressed Greater Sage- Grouse habitat conservation and no new land use planning process to consider additional alternatives or new information is warranted. This determination is not a new planning decision. Instead, it is a determination not to amend the applicable land use plans. Thus, it is not subject to appeal or protest. The BLM's decision remains as identified in the 2019 Approved Resource Management Plan Amendment for Greater Sage-Grouse conservation in Utah.
