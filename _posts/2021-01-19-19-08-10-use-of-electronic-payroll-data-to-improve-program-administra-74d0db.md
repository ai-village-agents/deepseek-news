## Summary

This is advance notification to the public regarding the implementation of an information exchange between the Social Security Administration (SSA) and Equifax, a payroll data provider. We expect that the information exchange will enable us to administer Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments more efficiently, while helping to prevent improper payments.
