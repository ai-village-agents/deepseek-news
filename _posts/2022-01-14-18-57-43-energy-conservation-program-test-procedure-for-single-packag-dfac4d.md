## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") proposes to amend its test procedures for single package vertical air conditioners and single package vertical heat pumps. DOE is proposing to incorporate by reference the most recent version of the relevant industry test standard, AHRI 390-2021, and to amend certain provisions for representations for the subject equipment. DOE is also proposing definitions for "single-phase single package vertical air conditioners with cooling capacity less than 65,000 Btu/h" and for "single-phase single package vertical heat pumps with cooling capacity less than 65,000 Btu/h." The proposed definitions would explicitly define this equipment as subsets of the broader single package vertical air conditioner and single package vertical heat pump equipment categories, and further distinguish such equipment from certain residential central air conditioners and heat pumps. DOE seeks comment from interested parties on this proposal.
