## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, have received an application for an incidental permit to take the federally listed coastal California gnatcatcher, a bird species, under the Endangered Species Act. The permit application includes a proposed low-effect habitat conservation plan (HCP). In accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), we have prepared a draft low-effect screening form and environmental action statement supporting our preliminary determination that the proposed action qualifies as a categorical exclusion under NEPA. We are accepting comments on the permit application, proposed low-effect HCP, and draft NEPA compliance documentation.
