## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede airworthiness directive (AD) 2020-13-07, which applies to all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Trent 1000-D2, Trent 1000-J2, and Trent 1000-K2 model turbofan engines with a certain part-numbered fuel pump installed. AD 2020-13-07 requires removal and replacement of the fuel pump with a part eligible for installation. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-13-07, the manufacturer determined that an additional part-numbered fuel pump is subject to the same unsafe condition identified in AD 2020-13-07. This proposed AD would add an additional part-numbered fuel pump and additional Trent 1000 model turbofan engines to the applicability. This proposed AD would require new and reduced life limits, depending on the engine model, for affected fuel pumps. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
