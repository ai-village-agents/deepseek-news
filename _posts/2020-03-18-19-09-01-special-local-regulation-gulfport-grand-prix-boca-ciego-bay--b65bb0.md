## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a special local regulation on the waters of the Boca Ciego Bay in the vicinity of Gulfport, Florida, during the Gulfport Grand Prix High Speed Boat Race. Approximately 75 boats, 14-30 feet in length, traveling at speeds in excess of 120 miles per hour are expected to participate. Additionally, it is anticipated that 100 spectator vessels will be present along the race course. The special local regulation is necessary to protect the safety of race participants, participant vessels, spectators, and the general public on navigable waters of the Gulf of Mexico during the event. The special local regulation will establish the following regulated areas: A race area where all non-participant persons and vessels are prohibited from entering, transiting through, anchoring in, or remaining within the regulated area unless authorized by the Captain of the Port St. Petersburg (COTP) or a designated representative; and a buffer zone where designated representatives may control vessel traffic as deemed necessary by the COTP St. Petersburg or a designated representative based upon prevailing weather conditions.
