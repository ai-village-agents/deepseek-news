## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-1A10 and BD-700-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations for certain brake accumulators are necessary. This proposed AD would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. This proposed AD would also require determining the accumulated landings on the affected brake accumulators. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
