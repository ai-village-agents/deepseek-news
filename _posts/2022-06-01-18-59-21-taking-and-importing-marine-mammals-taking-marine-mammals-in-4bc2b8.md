## Summary

NMFS has received a request from the U.S. Navy (Navy) for revision of the existing regulations and Letters of Authorization (LOAs) authorizing the take of marine mammals incidental to Navy training and testing activities conducted in the Hawaii-Southern California Training and Testing (HSTT) Study Area. In 2021, two separate U.S. Navy vessels struck unidentified large whales on two separate occasions, one whale in June 2021 and one whale in July 2021. NMFS and the Navy discussed the vessel strikes, and the Navy has reanalyzed the potential for vessel strike in the HSTT Study Area. As a result, the Navy has requested two additional takes of large whales by serious injury or mortality by vessel strike for the remainder of the current regulatory period. Pursuant to regulations implementing the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), NMFS is announcing receipt of the Navy's application for the development and implementation of revised regulations governing this additional incidental taking of marine mammals. NMFS invites the public to provide information, suggestions, and comments on the Navy's application and request.
