## Summary

As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) announces that the Commission has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request for extension of approval of a collection of information from persons who may voluntarily participate in consumer focus groups. CPSC has also requested a revision of that collection. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) previously approved the collection of information under Control Number 3041-0136. OMB's most recent extension of approval will expire on March 31, 2024. On November 28, 2023, CPSC published a notice in the Federal Register to announce the agency's intention to seek extension of approval of the collection of information. The Commission received no comments. Therefore, by publication of this notice, the Commission announces that CPSC has submitted to the OMB a request for extension of approval of that collection of information.
