## Summary

Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on December 16, 2025, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of Huwais IP Holding LLC of Jackson, Michigan and Versah, LLC of Jackson, Michigan. An amended complaint was filed on January 6, 2026. The amended complaint alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain dental burs and kits thereof by reason of the infringement of: (1) certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 9,326,778 ("the '778 patent") and U.S. Patent No. 11,712,250 ("the '250 patent); and (2) U.S. Trademark Registration No. 6,261,888 ("the '888 mark"); U.S. Trademark Registration No. 6,261,886 ("the '886 mark"); and U.S. Trademark Registration No. 4,689,471 ("the '471 mark"). The amended complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The complainants request that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a general exclusion order, or in the alternative a limited exclusion order, and cease and desist orders.
