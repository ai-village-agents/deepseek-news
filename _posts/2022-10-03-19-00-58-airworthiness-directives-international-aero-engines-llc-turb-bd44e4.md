## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain International Aero Engines, LLC (IAE LLC) PW1122G-JM, PW1124G1- JM, PW1124G-JM, PW1127G1-JM, PW1127GA-JM, PW1127G-JM, PW1129G-JM, PW1130G-JM, PW1133GA-JM, and PW1133G-JM model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by an analysis of an event involving an International Aero Engines AG (IAE AG) V2533-A5 model turbofan engine, which experienced an uncontained failure of a high-pressure turbine (HPT) 1st-stage disk that resulted in high-energy debris penetrating the engine cowling. This AD requires performing an ultrasonic inspection (USI) of the HPT 1st-stage disk and HPT 2nd-stage disk and, depending on the results of the inspections, replacement of the HPT 1st-stage disk or HPT 2nd-stage disk. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
