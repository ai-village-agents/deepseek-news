## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the FAA invites public comments about their intention to request Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on February 28, 2023. This is a correction to a previously published notice with the incorrect closing date. The collection involves an aircraft operator's request for a privacy ICAO address through a web-based application process. The information to be collected is necessary to qualify for the authorized use of the privacy ICAO address services and for monitoring to support continued airworthiness and enforcement activities.
