## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG Trent 1000-A, Trent 1000- A2, Trent 1000-AE, Trent 1000-AE2, Trent 1000-C, Trent 1000-C2, Trent 1000-CE, Trent 1000-CE2, Trent 1000-D, Trent 1000-D2, Trent 1000-E, Trent 1000-E2, Trent 1000-G, Trent 1000-G2, Trent 1000-H, Trent 1000- H2, Trent 1000-J2, Trent 1000-K2, and Trent 1000-L2 model turbofan engines. This proposed AD was prompted by the manufacturer identifying 38 low-pressure compressor (LPC) front cases that have non-optimal properties that could inhibit their ability to contain certain engine failures. This proposed AD would require removing the LPC front case from service and replacing it with a part eligible for installation. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
