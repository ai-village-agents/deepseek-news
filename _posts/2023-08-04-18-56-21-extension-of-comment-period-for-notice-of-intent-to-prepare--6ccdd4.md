## Summary

The Galveston District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) intends to prepare a Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) for the Matagorda Ship Channel Improvement Project consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). While a Record of Decision (ROD) for this project was signed on April 22, 2020, during the pre-construction engineering and design (PED) phase, USACE identified a discrepancy between its current calculations on the quantity of material to be dredged from the Matagorda Ship Channel and the quantity reflected in the ROD. Due to the discrepancy, USACE will prepare a SEIS to document and disclose the impacts of substantial changes to the proposed action and new information that are relevant to environmental concerns. By publication of this NOI, USACE is extending the scoping period and accepting comments due to a previously published incorrect email address.
