## Summary

In the Energy Act of 2020, the Secretary of Energy is charged with establishing and carrying out, through the Office of Nuclear Energy, a program to support the availability of uranium enriched to greater than 5 and less than 20 weight percent uranium-235 (U-235) (i.e., high-assay low-enriched uranium [HALEU]), for civilian domestic research, development, demonstration, and commercial use. Consistent with the objectives of, and direction in the Energy Act of 2020, the Department of Energy (DOE) proposes to take actions to establish a temporary domestic demand for HALEU to stimulate a diverse, domestic commercial HALEU supply that could ultimately lead to a competitive HALEU market and a more certain domestic HALEU demand. To this end, DOE intends to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and its implementing regulations that will analyze the impacts of DOE's Proposed Action to facilitate the domestic commercialization of HALEU production and to acquire HALEU for ultimate commercial use or demonstration projects.
