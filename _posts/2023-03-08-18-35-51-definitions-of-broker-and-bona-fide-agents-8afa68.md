## Summary

FMCSA is reopening the comment period for its interim guidance, Definitions of Broker and Bona Fide Agents. The interim guidance informs the public and regulated entities about FMCSA's interpretation of the definitions of broker and bona fide agents as it relates to all brokers of transportation by commercial motor vehicle. FMCSA is taking this action to better define the terms in response to a mandate in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). After consideration of public comments received, FMCSA provided clarification on its interpretation of the definitions of broker and bona fide agents, in addition to meeting other criteria required by the IIJA. While the interim guidance was effective immediately upon publication, FMCSA sought comments to the interim guidance and will issue final guidance by June 16, 2023. FMCSA is reopening the comment period in anticipation of hosting a public listening session allowing comments on this topic. FMCSA will host the session at 10 a.m. on March 31, 2023, in Louisville, KY, and concurrently with the Mid America Trucking Show (MATS). Anyone wishing to attend can register at: https:// www.eventbrite.com/e/fmcsa-session-2-broker-regulatory-session-tickets- 549535173497. In addition, a transcript of the public listening session will be placed in the guidance docket.
