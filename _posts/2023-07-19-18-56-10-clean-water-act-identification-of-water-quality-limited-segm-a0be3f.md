# Clean Water Act: Identification of Water Quality-Limited Segments To Be Added to West Virginia's Section 303(d) List

## Summary

The Clean Water Act (CWA) requires that states periodically submit, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approve or disapprove, lists of waters (called "Section 303(d) lists") for which existing technology-based pollution controls are not stringent enough to attain or maintain State water quality standards and for which total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) must be prepared. Waters identified on Section 303(d) lists are called "water quality-limited segments." This notice announces the EPA's identification of certain additional water quality-limited segments for West Virginia's Combined 2018-2020- 2022 Section 303(d) list and requests public comment on those additions.
