## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry (GFI) #264 entitled "Standardized Medicated Feed Assay Limits." This draft guidance recommends a standardized set of assay limits for medicated feeds. Standardized medicated feed assay limits allow predictability in the review process as sponsors can determine early in the drug development process what assay limits they should expect to meet for medicated feeds used in Target Animal Safety, Effectiveness, Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls, Bioequivalence, and Human Food Safety residue chemistry studies.
