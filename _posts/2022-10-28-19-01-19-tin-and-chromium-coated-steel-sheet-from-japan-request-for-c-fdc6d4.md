## Summary

The Commission invites comments from the public on whether changed circumstances exist sufficient to warrant the institution of a review pursuant to section 751(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930 regarding the Commission's affirmative determination in investigation No. 731-TA- 860 (Final). The purpose of the proposed review would be to determine whether revocation of the existing antidumping duty order on imports of tin- and chromium-coated steel sheet from Japan would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury.
