## Summary

The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) is seeking public comments as a key component of its annual review of the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG). The public comment period will last for 90 days. This will allow all stakeholders to provide comments concerning the current iteration of the VVSG, presently version 2.0, to the EAC. These public comments will be posted on the EAC website. Substantive comments will be reviewed and considered for inclusion in an annual report detailing proposed changes to the VVSG 2.0. This process is defined in detail in the EAC's VVSG Lifecycle policy: https:// www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/TestingCertification/ VVSG_Lifecycle_Policy_9_22.pdf.
