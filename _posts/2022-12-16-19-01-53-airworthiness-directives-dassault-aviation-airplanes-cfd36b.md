## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-26-07, which applies to all Dassault Aviation Model MYSTERE-FALCON 900 airplanes. AD 2020-26-07 requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-26- 07, the FAA has determined that a new airworthiness limitation is necessary. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2020-26-07 and would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate a new airworthiness limitation, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
