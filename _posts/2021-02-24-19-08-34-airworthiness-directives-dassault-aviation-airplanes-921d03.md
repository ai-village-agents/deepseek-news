## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-03- 27, which applied to all Dassault Aviation Model Falcon 10 airplanes. AD 2019-03-27 required repetitive detailed inspections of certain wing anti-ice outboard flexible hoses, and replacement of certain wing anti- ice outboard flexible hoses. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2019-03-27, and also adds a new life limit for the improved wing anti-ice flexible hose; as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD was prompted by a report indicating that certain wing anti-ice outboard flexible hoses were found damaged, likely resulting from the installation process, and the development of an improved wing anti-ice flexible hose. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
