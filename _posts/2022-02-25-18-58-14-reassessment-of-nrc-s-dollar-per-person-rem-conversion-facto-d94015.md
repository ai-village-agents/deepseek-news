## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing NUREG- 1530, Revision 1, "Reassessment of NRC's Dollar Per Person-Rem Conversion Factor Policy." This revision to NUREG-1530 updates the dollar per person-rem conversion factor and establishes a method for keeping this factor up-to-date. The NRC uses the dollar per person-rem conversion factor in cost-benefit analyses to determine the monetary valuation of the consequences associated with radiological exposure and establishes this factor by multiplying a value of a statistical life (VSL) coefficient by a cancer mortality risk coefficient.
