## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Pratt & Whitney Canada Corp. (P&WC) PT6E-67XP model turboprop engines with serial number HP0194 and earlier. This AD is prompted by multiple reports of engines failing to achieve required power (torque) during high power applications due to internal leaks in the bleed-off valves (BOVs). This AD requires replacement of the compressor BOV assembly, replacement of the BOV orifice feed air tube assembly, and installation of a redesigned P3 probe snorkel, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is incorporated by reference (IBR). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
