## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Helicopters Model SA330J helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a review of Model EC225LP helicopter data that revealed potential tightening torque loss of the attachment screws of the upper deck fittings of the three main gearbox (MGB) suspension bars. Due to design similarities, the MGB right-hand (RH) rear fittings and MGB RH rear fitting attachment screws on Model SA330J helicopters could also be affected. Additional analysis confirmed that the service life limit (life limit) (SLL) for these affected MGB RH rear fittings needs to be reduced for helicopters on which these affected parts were operated concurrently with metallic main rotor blades installed. This proposed AD would require determining the damage value and SLL of each affected MGB RH rear fitting, replacing each affected MGB RH rear fitting with a new part, and replacing the MGB RH rear fitting attachment screws, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
