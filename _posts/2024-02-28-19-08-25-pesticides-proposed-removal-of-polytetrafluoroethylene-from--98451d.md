## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to remove polytetrafluoroethylene (CAS No. 9002-84-0) from the current list of inert ingredients approved for use in food use and nonfood use pesticide products because this inert ingredient has been identified as a per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) that is no longer used in any registered pesticide product.
