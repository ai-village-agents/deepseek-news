## Summary

The Coast Guard is removing an existing regulated navigation area in Sparkman Channel, located in Tampa, FL. The regulated navigation area is no longer needed to protect vessels navigating in the area. This action removes the existing regulations related to restricting vessel draft in the channel due to an underwater pipeline that is no longer a navigational concern.
