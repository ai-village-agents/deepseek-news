## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving revisions to the Yakima Regional Clean Air Agency (YRCAA) regulations designed to control particulate matter from residential wood heaters, such as woodstoves and fireplaces. The updated YRCAA regulations set fine particulate matter trigger levels for impaired air quality burn bans, consistent with statutory changes enacted by the Washington State Legislature. The submission also contains updates to improve the clarity of the language and align with the statewide solid fuel burning device regulations already applicable in YRCAA's jurisdiction. We are approving these changes because they meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and strengthen the Washington State Implementation Plan (SIP).
