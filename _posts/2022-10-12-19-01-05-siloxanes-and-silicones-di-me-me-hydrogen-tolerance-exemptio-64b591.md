## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of siloxanes and silicones, di-Me, Me hydrogen, reaction products with vinyl group-terminated di-Me siloxanes (CAS Reg. No. 156065-02-0), when used as an inert ingredient in a pesticide chemical formulation. The Dow Chemical Company submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of siloxanes and silicones, di-Me, Me hydrogen, reaction products with vinyl group-terminated di-Me siloxanes on food or feed commodities.
