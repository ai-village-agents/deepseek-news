## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation Model GVII-G600 airplanes. This AD was prompted by an addition of a life limit in the Airworthiness Limitations Section (ALS) for GVII-G600 flap yokes. The life limit for the GVII-G600 flap yokes was informed by a GVII-G500 flap yoke failure that occurred during flight testing and, ultimately, resulted in additional test and analysis to establish more accurate life limits reflective of each model's design features and stress levels. The FAA is issuing this AD to require revising the existing ALS to prevent the GVII-G600 inboard flap yoke from remaining in service beyond its life limit. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
