## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve revisions to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) and Operating Permits Program and the 112(l) plan submitted by the State of Kansas on February 20, 2023. The revised Kansas rules update the Class I emission fee and emissions inventory regulations, establish a Class II fee schedule and ensure that Kansas's Operating Permits Program is adequately funded. Approval of these revisions ensures consistency between the State and federally-approved rules and does not impact air quality.
