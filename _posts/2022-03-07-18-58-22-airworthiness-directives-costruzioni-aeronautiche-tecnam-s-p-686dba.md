## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Costruzioni Aeronautiche Tecnam S.P.A. Model P2012 Traveller airplanes. This proposed AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI describes the unsafe condition as free play in the trim tab actuator and trim tab surface. This proposed AD would require repetitively inspecting the trim tab trailing edge to determine if free play exists and taking corrective actions as needed. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
