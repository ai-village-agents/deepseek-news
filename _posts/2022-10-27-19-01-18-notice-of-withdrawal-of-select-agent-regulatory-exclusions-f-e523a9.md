## Summary

We are advising the public that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has withdrawn the select agent regulatory exclusions for two African swine fever virus strains, ASFV-G-[Delta]MGF and ASFV-G-[Delta]9GL/[Delta]MGF. Possession, use, and transfer of these strains must now comply with APHIS' select agent and toxin regulations. APHIS withdrew the select agent regulatory exclusions for these strains because it has evaluated new information and determined that they have the potential to pose a severe threat to animal health or animal products.
