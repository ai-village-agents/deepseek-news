## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of cellulose, ethyl 2-hydroxyethyl ether (CAS Reg. No. 9004-58-4), when used as an inert ingredient in a pesticide chemical formulation. Spring Regulatory Sciences, on behalf of Nouryon Chemicals LLC USA, submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of cellulose, ethyl 2-hydroxyethyl ether, on food or feed commodities.
