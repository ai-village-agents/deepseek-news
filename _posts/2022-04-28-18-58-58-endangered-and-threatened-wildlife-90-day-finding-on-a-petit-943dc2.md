## Summary

We, NMFS, announce a 90-day finding on a petition under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to list the tope shark (Galeorhinus galeus) as a threatened or endangered species and to designate critical habitat concurrent with the listing. We find that the petition presents substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted. Therefore, we are commencing a review of the status of the tope shark to determine whether listing under the ESA is warranted. To support a comprehensive status review, we are soliciting scientific and commercial data regarding this species.
