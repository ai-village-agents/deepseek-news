## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2024-06-06 for all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Model Trent7000-72 and Trent7000-72C engines. AD 2024-06-06 required revising the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the operator's existing approved engine maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive tasks and limitations and associated thresholds and intervals for life-limited parts. Since the FAA issued AD 2024-06-06, the manufacturer has revised the engine time limits manual (TLM) to introduce new or more restrictive tasks and limitations and associated thresholds and intervals for life-limited parts, which prompted this AD. This AD requires revising the ALS of the existing approved engine maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive tasks and limitations and associated thresholds and intervals for life-limited parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
