## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Helicopters Model AS332C, AS332C1, AS332L, AS332L1, and AS332L2 helicopters. This AD was prompted by reports of a crack in the front upper hoist attachment fitting. This AD requires inspecting each affected hoist attachment fitting (fitting) and depending on the results, removing any cracked fitting from service and reporting information. This AD also prohibits installing an affected fitting unless the required actions are accomplished, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
