## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-700, -800, -900, and -900ER series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of a runway excursion caused by loss of braking. An inspection found that the right main landing gear (MLG) hydraulic hoses for the brakes were incorrectly installed at the flow limiters, and the left MLG wheel speed transducer wires were also interchanged. This AD requires a general visual inspection (GVI) of the left and right MLG brake hydraulic hoses for any crossed installation, antiskid valve and transducer operational tests, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
