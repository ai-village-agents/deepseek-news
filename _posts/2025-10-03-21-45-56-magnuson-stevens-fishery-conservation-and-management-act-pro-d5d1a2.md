## Summary

This rule extends the emergency measures to revise portions of the fishing year 2025 provisions in the Northeast multispecies fishery. This action is necessary to address an emergency presented by an absence of approved specifications and other measures for fishing year 2025. This action is intended to mitigate economic harm to the Northeast multispecies fishery participants by establishing fish stock quotas and related measures that allow the fishery to operate while preventing overfishing.
