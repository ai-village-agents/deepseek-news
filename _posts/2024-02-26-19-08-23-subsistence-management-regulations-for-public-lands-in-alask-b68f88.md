## Summary

This proposed rule would revise the regulations concerning the composition of the Federal Subsistence Board (Board) by adding three public members nominated or recommended by federally recognized Tribal governments, requiring that those nominees have personal knowledge of and direct experience with subsistence uses in rural Alaska including Alaska Native subsistence uses, defining requirements used for the selection of the Board Chair, affirming the Secretaries' authority to replace members from the Board, and affirming the Secretaries' responsibility and oversight regarding Board decisions while incorporating a ratification requirement. In January 2022, the Department of the Interior (DOI) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) held joint consultations with federally recognized Tribes of Alaska and various Tribal Consortia. Later during October-November 2022, DOI leadership and the Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, held joint consultations with various Alaska Tribes regarding fisheries. Approximately 445 individual subsistence users and representatives from Alaska Native Tribes, Tribal consortia, Alaska Native organizations, and Native corporations participated in the consultations, and a majority of the commenters specifically requested increasing the number of public members to five and adding more voting members who represent Alaska Native Villages and have local knowledge and direct subsistence experience.
