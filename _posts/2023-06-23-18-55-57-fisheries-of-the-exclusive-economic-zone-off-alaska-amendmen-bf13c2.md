## Summary

This action corrects an inadvertent drafting error in final regulations published in the Federal Register on February 27, 2023, and effective on February 27, 2023. NMFS is correcting regulations to revise the date after which only an eligible community resident of Adak, Alaska may receive by transfer any individual fishing quota (IFQ) held by a community quota entity (CQE) in the Aleutian Islands subarea. In the final rule published on February 27, 2023, NMFS intended to extend by five years the date after which only an eligible community resident of Adak, AK may use or receive by transfer CQE IFQ. This action completes the removal of the Adak CQE residency requirement for a period of five years.
