## Summary

The FAA proposes to amend two Jet Routes and one VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal Airway; establish one low altitude RNAV route; and revoke one Domestic Low Altitude Reporting Point, in the northcentral United States. This action is necessary due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Humboldt, MN, VOR/ Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) which provides navigation guidance to portions of the affected Air Traffic Service (ATS) routes. The Humboldt VOR is being decommissioned as part of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (VOR MON) program.
