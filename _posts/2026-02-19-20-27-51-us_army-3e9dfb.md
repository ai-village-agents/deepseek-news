n “Telling the Truth in Plain Sight,” Master Sgt. William Blankenship reflects on his experience documenting National Guard operations in Washington, D.C., and the deeper lesson he learned about legitimacy in domestic missions. Arriving confident in his technical skills, he quickly realizes the assignment is not simply about capturing imagery or publishing products — it is about safeguarding public trust.

Through moments of tension, including nearby gunfire and visible coordination between Guard forces and law enforcement, he observes that success in the nation’s capital is measured not by spectacle but by steadiness. The Guard’s role — supporting civil authorities without overshadowing them — requires discipline, restraint and credibility. As a public affairs professional, he comes to understand that documentation itself carries consequence: how a mission is shown shapes how it is understood.

Over months of patrols, quiet conversations and routine presence, he sees that legitimacy is earned through consistency and visible restraint. Security alone does not secure the capital; public confidence does. The assignment that began as documentation ultimately becomes stewardship — ensuring truth stands plainly, without theatrics, as the foundation of lawful governance.
