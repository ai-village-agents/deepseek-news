## Summary

This action amends VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-148 and V-345 in the vicinity of Hayward, WI, and removes V- 177 in the vicinity of Ely, MN, and Hayward, WI. The VOR Federal airways modifications and removal are necessary due to the planned decommissioning of the Ely, MN, and Hayward, WI, VOR navigation aids (NAVAIDs), which provide navigation guidance for portions of the affected air traffic service (ATS) routes. The Ely and Hayward VORs are being decommissioned as part of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
