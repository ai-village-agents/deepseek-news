## Summary

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is modifying its regulations to reduce the frequency of renewal applications by indirect air carriers (IACs). Rather than requiring these entities to submit an application to renew their security program each year, TSA now requires renewal once every 3 years. This modification reduces the burden of compliance without a negative impact on security.
