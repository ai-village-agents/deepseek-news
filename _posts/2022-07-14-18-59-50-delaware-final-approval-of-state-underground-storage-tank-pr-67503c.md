This action also codifies EPA's approval of Delaware's State program and incorporates by reference (IBR) those provisions of Delaware's regulations and statutes that EPA has determined meet the requirements for approval. The provisions will be subject to EPA's inspection and enforcement authorities under sections 9005 and 9006 of RCRA Subtitle I and other applicable statutory and regulatory provisions.
