## Summary

The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) and the Rural Business- Cooperative Service (RBCS or the Agency) published a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) in the Federal Register of August 23, 2022, entitled Higher Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program (HBIIP) to announce that it was accepting applications for fiscal year 2022 (FY 22) and the availability of approximately $100 million in competitive grants. In addition, the FOA defined requirements that are determined at the time a funding announcement is published, as outlined in the regulation. The FOA omitted clarifying information regarding eligible applicants for the funding. The Eligible Applicants section is being updated to clarify that hybrid applications, or those including transportation fueling facility implementation activities and fuel distribution facilities implementation activities, are ineligible. This Notice clarifies that applicants can only apply for one of the two applicant types and those successful applicants will only receive the funding associated with one applicant type.
