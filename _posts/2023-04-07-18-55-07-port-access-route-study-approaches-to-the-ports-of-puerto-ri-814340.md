## Summary

The Coast Guard is conducting a Port Access Route Study to evaluate safe access routes for the movement of vessel traffic proceeding to or from the ports or places in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and to determine whether shipping safety fairways and/or routing measures should be established, adjusted, or modified. The Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands Port Access Route Study considers whether such measures are necessary to improve navigation safety due to factors such as planned or potential offshore development, current port capabilities and planned improvements, increased vessel traffic, existing and potential anchorage areas, changing vessel traffic patterns, effects of weather, or navigational difficulty. Vessel routing measures, which include traffic separation schemes, two-way routes, recommended tracks, deep-water routes, precautionary areas, and areas to be avoided, are implemented to reduce the risk of marine casualties. To assist us in conducting the Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands Port Access Route Study, we invite your responses to the questions in the INFORMATION REQUESTED section. The recommendations of the study may subsequently be implemented through rulemakings or in accordance with international agreements.
