## Summary

GSA is issuing a final rule that makes technical amendments to the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) regarding gender neutrality. These technical amendments result in more inclusive language by replacing gender-specific pronouns (e.g., he, she, his, her) with non-gendered pronouns. These changes are grammatical and technical in nature and do not result in added costs or associated policy changes.
