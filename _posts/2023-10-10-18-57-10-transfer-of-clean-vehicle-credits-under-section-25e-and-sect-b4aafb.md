## Summary

This document contains proposed regulations that would provide guidance regarding certain clean vehicle credits as established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The proposed regulations would provide guidance for taxpayers who purchase qualifying previously-owned clean vehicles or purchase qualifying new clean vehicles and intend to transfer the amount of any previously-owned clean vehicle credit or new clean vehicle credit to dealers who are entities eligible to receive advance payments of either credit. The proposed regulations also would provide guidance for dealers to become eligible entities to receive advance payments of previously-owned clean vehicle credits or new clean vehicle credits, and rules regarding recapture of the credits. The proposed regulations would affect taxpayers intending to transfer previously-owned clean vehicle or new clean vehicle credits and eligible entities to whom the credits are transferred, as well as taxpayers who purchased previously-owned clean vehicles or new clean vehicles in the event the vehicles cease being eligible for the credits. The proposed regulations also provide guidance on the meaning of three new definitions added to the exclusive list of "mathematical or clerical errors" relating to certain assessments of tax without a notice of deficiency.
