## Summary

In this final rule, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) makes changes to the Syria export control measures under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), consistent with Executive Order (E.O.) 14312, Providing for the Revocation of Syria Sanctions, which directed the removal of sanctions on Syria. This final rule relaxes the EAR's existing restrictions on exports and reexports to Syria of items subject to the EAR by making the following changes: revising certain restrictive license application review policies that had applied to most items subject to the EAR to be more favorable; expanding existing license exceptions to apply to Syria; and adding new license exceptions for Syria, including for EAR99 items.
