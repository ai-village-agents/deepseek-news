## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain AVOX System Inc. (formerly Scott Aviation) oxygen cylinder and valve assemblies; and oxygen valve assemblies; installed on but not limited to various transport airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of cylinder and valve assemblies having oxygen leakage from the valve assembly vent hole, caused by the absence of a guide that maintains appropriate spacing between certain parts. This proposed AD would require an inspection of the oxygen valve assemblies, and oxygen cylinder and valve assemblies, to determine the serial number of the valve, cylinder, and entire assembly. For assemblies and parts with certain serial numbers, this AD would require a detailed inspection for correct spacing of the gap between the bottom of the packing retainer and top of the valve body on the assemblies, and replacement of assemblies having unacceptable gaps. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
