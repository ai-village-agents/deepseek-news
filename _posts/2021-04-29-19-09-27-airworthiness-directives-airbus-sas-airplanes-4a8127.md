## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A318, A319, A320, and A321 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a potential quality issue in the fuel pump that includes a locking key of the impeller drive shaft found loose in the cavity under the impeller. This AD requires replacement of affected fuel pumps, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
