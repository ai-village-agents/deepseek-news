## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce a 12-month finding on a petition to list the Suwannee alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys suwanniensis), a freshwater turtle species from the Suwannee River basin in Georgia and Florida, as a threatened species. After a review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that listing the species is warranted. Accordingly, we propose to list the Suwannee alligator snapping turtle as a threatened species with a rule issued under section 4(d) of the Act ("4(d) rule"). If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would add the species to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and extend the Act's protections to the species.
