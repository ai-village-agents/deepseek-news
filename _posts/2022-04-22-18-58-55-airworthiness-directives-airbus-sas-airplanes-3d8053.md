## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-13-08 which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2018-13-08 requires repetitive inspections for cracking of the radius of the front spar vertical stringers and the horizontal floor beam on frame (FR) 36, repetitive inspections for cracking of the fastener holes of the front spar vertical stringers on FR 36, and repair if necessary, and, for certain airplanes, a potential terminating action modification of the center wing box area. Since the FAA issued AD 2018-13-08, Airbus has determined that additional airplanes are subject to the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would revise the applicability by adding airplanes and retain the requirements of AD 2018-13-08, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
