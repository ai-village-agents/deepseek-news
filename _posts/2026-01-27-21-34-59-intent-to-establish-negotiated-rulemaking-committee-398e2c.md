## Summary

We announce our intention to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to prepare proposed regulations amending the regulations for the Secretary's recognition of accrediting agencies and related institutional eligibility regulations for the programs authorized under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA) (title IV, HEA programs). The committee will include representatives of organizations or groups with interests that are significantly affected by the subject matter of the proposed regulations. We request nominations for individual negotiators who represent key stakeholder constituencies for the issues to be negotiated to serve on the committee, and we set a schedule for committee meetings.
