# Energy Conservation Program: Test Procedure for Water-Source Heat Pumps

## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is amending its test procedure for water-source heat pumps to expand the scope of applicability of the test procedure, incorporate by reference a new industry consensus test standard for water-source heat pumps, adopt a seasonal cooling efficiency metric, and specify more representative test conditions used for measuring heating performance. DOE has determined that the amended test procedure will produce results that are more representative of an average use cycle and be more consistent with current industry practice without being unduly burdensome to conduct. Additionally, DOE is adopting provisions governing public representations of efficiency for this equipment.
