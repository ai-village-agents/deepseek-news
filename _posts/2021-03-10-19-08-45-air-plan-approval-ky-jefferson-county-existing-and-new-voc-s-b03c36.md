## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving revisions to the Jefferson County portion of the Kentucky State Implementation Plan (SIP), submitted by the Commonwealth of Kentucky, through the Energy and Environment Cabinet (Cabinet), on September 5, 2019. The revisions were submitted by the Cabinet on behalf of the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District (District or APCD) and make changes to the regulations for existing and new storage vessels for volatile organic compounds (VOCs). EPA is approving the revisions that regulate existing and new storage vessels for VOCs because the changes are consistent with the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act).
