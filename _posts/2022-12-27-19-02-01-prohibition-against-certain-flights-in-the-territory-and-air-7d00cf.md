## Summary

This action amends and extends the prohibition against certain flight operations in the territory and airspace of Somalia at altitudes below Flight Level 260 (FL260) by all: U.S. air carriers; U.S. commercial operators; persons exercising the privileges of an airman certificate issued by the FAA, except when such persons are operating U.S.-registered aircraft for a foreign air carrier; and operators of U.S.-registered civil aircraft, except when the operator of such aircraft is a foreign air carrier. The FAA is amending the flight prohibition to permit overwater operations in the territory and airspace of Somalia at altitudes below FL260 to the extent necessary for climb-outs from, and descents into, Djibouti Ambouli International Airport (HDAM) in the Addis Ababa Flight Information Region (FIR) (HAAA), subject to the approval of, and in accordance with the conditions established by, the appropriate authorities of Djibouti and consistent with air traffic control instructions. Operators climbing out of or descending into Djibouti Ambouli International Airport (HDAM) must remain overwater while operating in the territorial airspace of Somalia at altitudes below FL260 and must operate either on a published instrument procedure or under the direction of air traffic control. The FAA determined the risk to the safety of such operations is low. However, due to increasing safety-of-flight risks to U.S. civil aviation in the rest of the territory and airspace of Somalia at altitudes below FL260 from extremist and militant activity, the FAA also extends the expiration date of this rule from January 7, 2023, until January 7, 2027. The FAA also republishes the approval process and exemption information for this Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR), consistent with other recently published flight prohibition SFARs.
