## Summary

Pursuant to the Pork Promotion, Research, and Consumer Information Act of 1985 (Act) and the Pork Promotion, Research, and Consumer Information Order (Order) thereunder, this rulemaking decreases the current rate of assessment of 0.40 percent of the market value of live porcine animals to 0.35 percent and decreases the amount of assessment per pound due on imported pork and pork products (one- to three-hundredths of a cent per pound). These reductions in assessment rates are made in response to the approximately 47 percent increase in 2021 in the average prices of live hogs above its 3-year average from 2018-2020 and reflect the National Pork Producers Delegate Body's (Delegate Body) desire to lessen the assessment burden on producers and make such funds available to pork producers and the industry. The adjustment in importer assessments also brings the equivalent market value of live animals from which imported pork and pork products are derived in line with the market value of domestic porcine animals. This action also updates the Harmonized Tariff Schedule number for prepared or preserved pork in the regulation.
