## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission or CFTC) is proposing to amend its derivatives clearing organization (DCO) risk management regulations adopted under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) to permit futures commission merchants (FCMs) that are clearing members (clearing FCMs) to treat the separate accounts of a single customer as accounts of separate entities for purposes of certain Commission regulations. The proposed amendments would establish the conditions under which a DCO may permit such separate account treatment.
