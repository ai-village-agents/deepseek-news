## Summary

The FAA is revising an earlier proposal for Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (Airbus Helicopters) Model MBB-BK 117A-3, MBB-BK 117A- 4, MBB-BK 117B-1, MBB-BK 117B-2, and MBB-BK 117C-1 helicopters. This action revises the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) by expanding the applicability and proposing to add requirements to replace certain seals with newly certified seals and revise the Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) for your helicopter. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive (AD) to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over those in the NPRM, the FAA is reopening the comment period to allow the public the chance to comment on these changes.
