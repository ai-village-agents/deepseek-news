## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-1A10 and BD-700-1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that easy removal of the portable oxygen bottle from its support bracket may not always be possible on certain installations. This AD requires installation of a modified top bracket and new middle bracket on all affected portable oxygen bottle installations. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
