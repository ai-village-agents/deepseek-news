## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action, finding that the State of Alabama failed to submit a complete infrastructure State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision to satisfy certain interstate transport requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) with respect to the 2015 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). Specifically, these requirements pertain to prohibiting significant contribution to nonattainment, or interference with maintenance, of the 2015 8-hour ozone NAAQS in other states. This finding of failure to submit a complete revision establishes a 2-year deadline for EPA to promulgate a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) to address these interstate transport requirements for Alabama unless, prior to EPA promulgating a FIP, Alabama submits, and EPA approves, a SIP that meets these requirements.
