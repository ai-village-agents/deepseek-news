## Summary

The Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) submitted to NMFS three fishery management plan (FMP) amendments: Amendment 19 to the FMP for Coastal Pelagic Species (CPS FMP), Amendment 7 to the FMP for the West Coast Highly Migratory Species (HMS FMP), and Amendment 22 to the FMP for Pacific Coast Salmon Fisheries (Salmon FMP) (collectively Amendments). If approved by the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary), these Amendments would add to or modify language in the CPS, HMS, and Salmon FMPs to more clearly describe and align the FMPs with the way bycatch is currently reported in the fisheries managed by the Council. These Amendments are intended to promote the goals and objectives of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act); the CPS, HMS, and Salmon FMPs; and other applicable laws.
