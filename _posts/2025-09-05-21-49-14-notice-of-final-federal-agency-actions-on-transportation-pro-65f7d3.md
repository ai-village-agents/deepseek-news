## Summary

This notice announces actions taken by the FHWA, on behalf of the Lincoln/Lancaster County Railroad Transportation Safety District (RTSD), that are final. The action(s) relate to the North 33rd and Cornhusker Project (also known as the 33rd/Cornhusker Viaduct, Lincoln Project), located in the City of Lincoln, Lancaster County, Nebraska. Those actions grant licenses, permits, and approvals for the project. The project closes the at-grade railroad crossings at N. 33rd Street and Adams Street by improving the roadway network in this area and constructing a grade separation across the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) Railway tracks at approximately N. 31st Street, south of Cornhusker Highway. The existing at-grade crossing at N. 44th Street will remain open to vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic and will be improved. Cornhusker Highway will be expanded to six lanes with turn lanes from Deadmans Run to 35th Street. The FHWA's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) provides details on the Selected Alternative for the proposed improvements.
