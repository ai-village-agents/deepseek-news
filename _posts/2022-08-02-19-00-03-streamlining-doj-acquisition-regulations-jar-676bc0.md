## Summary

The Department of Justice is revising the Justice Acquisition Regulations (JAR) in its entirety in order to update and streamline agency procurement actions consistent with the Federal Acquisition Reform Act, and the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act. The JAR supplements the executive branch-wide Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) to address matters specific to the Department of Justice relating to its procurement of goods and services. It covers mostly internal policies and procedures, but also includes some rules governing private entities doing business with the Department.
