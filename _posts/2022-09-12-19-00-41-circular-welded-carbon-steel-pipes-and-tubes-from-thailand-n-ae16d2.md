## Summary

On August 25, 2022, the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) issued its final judgment in Saha Steel Pipe Public Company, Ltd v. United States, Court No. 20-00133, Slip Op. 22-99 (Saha Steel), sustaining the Department of Commerce (Commerce)'s final results of redetermination pertaining to the scope ruling for the antidumping duty (AD) order on circular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes (CWP) from Thailand. In the redetermination, Commerce found that dual-stenciled standard pipe and line pipe are outside the scope of the order, pursuant to the CIT's remand order in Saha Thai Steel Pipe Public Company Ltd v. United States, 547 F. Supp. 3d 1278 (CIT Oct. 6, 2021) (Remand Order). Commerce is notifying the public that the CIT's final judgment is not in harmony with Commerce's final scope ruling, and that Commerce is amending the scope ruling to find that dual-stenciled standard pipe and line pipe are outside the scope of the order.
