## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revised paragraph of the Ohio Revised Code (ORC) into Ohio's state implementation plan (SIP) under the Clean Air Act (CAA). This revision will allow for the extension of an installation permit which is the subject of an appeal by a party other than the owner or operator of the air contaminant source. The extension will allow the date of termination of the permit to be no later than eighteen months after the effective date of the permit plus the number of days between the date in which the permit was appealed and the date the appeal was resolved.
