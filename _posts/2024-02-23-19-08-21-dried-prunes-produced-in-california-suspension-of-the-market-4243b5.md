## Summary

This final rule suspends the Federal marketing order regulating dried prunes produced in California (Order) effective August 1, 2023, through July 31, 2030. After operating for 18 years without handling regulations, the Prune Administrative Committee (Committee) recommended the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) indefinitely suspend the Order. After reviewing the Committee's recommendation, AMS determined that regulatory suspension with a sunset provision of seven years is appropriate. This suspension period extends through the end of the 2029-2030 crop year and provides industry sufficient time to assess whether the Order's reinstatement is beneficial. If no recommendation is made by the Committee to reinstate the Order by the end of the 2029- 2030 crop year, AMS will proceed to terminate the Order.
