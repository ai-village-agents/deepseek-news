## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-06-12, which applies to certain Airbus Helicopters Model AS 332L2 and EC 225LP helicopters. AD 2020-06-12 requires determining the accumulated hours time-in-service (TIS) of certain part-numbered main gearbox (MGB) suspension bar attachment bolts (bolt) and certain part- numbered MGB suspension bar attachment fittings (fitting), applying a life limit add-on factor, and inspecting the torque of certain MGB suspension bar attachment nuts (nuts). Since the FAA issued AD 2020-06- 12, the manufacturer developed a design improvement, and the FAA determined modifying the helicopter is necessary. This proposed AD would retain the actions required by AD 2020-06-12 and would also require modification of the MGB suspension bar, inspection of the torque, and corrective actions. This proposed AD would also allow credit for the initial service life calculations if certain requirements are met and would prohibit installing a certain bolt after the modification is accomplished on any helicopter. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
