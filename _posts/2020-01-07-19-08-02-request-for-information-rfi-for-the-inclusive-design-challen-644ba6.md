## Summary

The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST) is seeking feedback on a proposed inclusive design challenge (Challenge) via this Request for Information (RFI). The Challenge is intended to incentivize creation of innovative, inclusive design solutions to enable access to automated vehicles (AV), also known as Highly automated Vehicles (HAV), for persons with disabilities. The Challenge seeks to emphasize the opportunities and challenges introduced by AVs which human occupants are not expected to drive, nor supervise the driving functions of the automated system, or perform any other element of the dynamic driving task as long as the vehicle remains within its operational design domain. The Challenge will solicit solutions addressing obstacles faced by persons with physical, sensory, and/or cognitive disabilities. The goal of the Challenge is to inspire inclusive designs as AVs are developed, which may also increase access to conventional vehicles today. Solutions proposed should aim to decrease the need to modify Level 4 and 5 AVs post-production, or to reduce the cost of retrofitting AVs for use by persons with disabilities, including wheelchair users.
