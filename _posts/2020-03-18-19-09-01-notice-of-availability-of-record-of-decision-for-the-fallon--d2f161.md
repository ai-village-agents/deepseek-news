## Summary

The United States (U.S.) Department of the Navy (Navy), after carefully weighing the strategic, operational, and environmental consequences of the Proposed Action, announces its decision to select Alternative 3 (Preferred Alternative) from the Fallon Range Training Complex (FRTC) Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) Environmental), dated January 2020. This alternative will support the Navy's request for a legislative proposal in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 for Congressional action and Presidential approval for renewal of the current federal land withdrawal and withdrawal of additional federal land to expand the range. It also includes the acquisition of non-federal land. While making this decision, the Navy carefully weighed its strategic and operational needs; potential impacts on the human, natural, and cultural environment; and comments from government officials and agencies, tribal governments, and the public on the proposal and environmental analysis. The Navy selected Alternative 3 because it best meets the purpose of and need for modernization while minimizing impacts on public access and land use. The Navy will implement management practices, monitoring, and mitigation measures to reduce potential impacts of the FRTC modernization.
