## Summary

Through this notice, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announces that the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) is terminating the designation of Syria for Temporary Protected Status. The designation of Syria is set to expire on September 30, 2025. After reviewing country conditions and consulting with appropriate U.S. Government agencies, the Secretary determined that Syria no longer continues to meet the conditions for the designation for Temporary Protected Status. The Secretary, therefore, is terminating the Temporary Protected Status designation of Syria as required by statute. This termination is effective November 21, 2025. After November 21, 2025, nationals of Syria (and aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in Syria) who have been granted Temporary Protected Status under Syria's designation will no longer have Temporary Protected Status.
