Chief Warrant Officer 3 Robert Riedel, assigned to the 1-214th General Support Aviation Battalion, 12th Combat Aviation Brigade, sits in the left seat of a CH‑47F Chinook conducting pre‑flight checks before takeoff at Katterbach Army Airfield, Germany, Feb. 4, 2026. The flight provided proficiency training for multiple pilots, a flight engineer, and a crew chief as they refined aircrew coordination, practiced aircraft handling in winter conditions, and reinforced the crew’s collective readiness for flight operations as part of routine training for all members.
