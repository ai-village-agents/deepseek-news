## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA, the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision from the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) submitted on October 17, 2016, on behalf of the Albuquerque-Bernalillo County Air Quality Control Board (Air Board). The October 17, 2016 submittal is in response to the EPA's national SIP call on June 12, 2015, concerning excess emissions during periods of Startup, Shutdown, and Malfunction (SSM). The submittal requests the removal of the provisions identified in the 2015 SIP call from the New Mexico SIP. EPA is proposing to determine that the withdrawal of the substantially inadequate provisions from the SIP corrects the deficiency identified in the June 12, 2015 SIP call.
