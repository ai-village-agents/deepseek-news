## Summary

We, NMFS, designate and authorize the release of a nonessential experimental population (NEP or experimental population) of Central Valley (CV) spring-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the upper Yuba River and its tributaries upstream of Englebright Dam, California, and under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), establish a limited set of take exceptions for the experimental population. Successful reintroduction of a population within the species' historical range would contribute to its viability and further its conservation. The issuance of limited protective regulations for the conservation of the species would provide assurances to the people of the upper Yuba River watershed. This document also announces the availability of a final environmental assessment (EA) that analyzed the environmental impacts of promulgating the experimental population rule and associated take exceptions.
