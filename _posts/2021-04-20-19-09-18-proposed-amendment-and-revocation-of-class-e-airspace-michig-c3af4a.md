## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace area extending upward from 1,200 feet above the surface over the State of Michigan and remove overlapping and redundant enroute domestic airspace areas within these boundaries. The FAA is proposing this action to correct, simplify, and close gaps in the Class E airspace extending upward from 1,200 feet above the surface over the State of Michigan; provide transitional airspace to support instrument flight rule (IFR) operations to and from the terminal and enroute environments within the state; and improve air traffic control services over the state.
