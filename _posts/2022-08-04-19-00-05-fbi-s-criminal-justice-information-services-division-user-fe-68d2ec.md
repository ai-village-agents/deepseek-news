## Summary

The FBI is authorized to establish and collect fees for providing fingerprint-based and name-based criminal history record information (CHRI) checks submitted by authorized users for noncriminal justice purposes including employment and licensing. A portion of the fee is intended to reimburse the FBI for the cost of providing fingerprint-based and name-based CHRI checks ("cost reimbursement portion" of the fee). The FBI is also authorized to charge an additional amount to defray expenses for the automation of fingerprint identification and criminal justice information services and associated costs ("automation portion" of the fee). Although the fee study determined that the allocation of costs changed, the overall fees for fingerprint-based and name-based CHRI checks will remain the same as the current user fees.
