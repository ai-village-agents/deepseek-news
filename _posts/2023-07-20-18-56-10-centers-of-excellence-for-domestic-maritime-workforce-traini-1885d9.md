# Centers of Excellence for Domestic Maritime Workforce Training and Education; Designation Policy Update and Notice of Opportunity To Apply for Designation for 2023

## Summary

This notice updates the Centers of Excellence for Domestic Maritime Workforce Training and Education (CoE) designation policy and invites eligible and qualified training entities to apply to the Maritime Administration (MARAD) for designation as a 2023 CoE. CoE designations serve to assist the maritime industry in obtaining and maintaining the highest quality workforce. On December 23, 2022, Congress passed the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (FY 2023 NDAA), which changed the eligibility criteria for CoE designations by amending the definition of "covered training entity" (see Key Terms). As a result, MARAD has terminated action on all 2022 applications which were based on eligibility criteria no longer valid under the new law.
