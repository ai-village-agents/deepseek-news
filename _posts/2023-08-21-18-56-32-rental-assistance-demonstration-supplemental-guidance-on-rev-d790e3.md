## Summary

The Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) provides the opportunity to test the conversion of assistance of public housing properties and other HUD-assisted properties to long-term, project- based Section 8 rental assistance. This document announces the posting of a supplement to the most current notice (Revised RAD Notice Revision 4, H-2019-09/PIH-2019-23 (HA)). As provided by the RAD Statute, this document addresses the requirement that RAD may proceed after publication of notice of its terms in the Federal Register. This document summarizes the key changes made to the H-2019-09/PIH-2019-23 (HA) through the RAD Supplemental Notice 4B, H-2023-08/PIH-2023-19 (HA). This document also meets the RAD statutory requirement to publish waivers and alternative requirements at least 10 days before effect, while this does not prevent the demonstration, as modified, from proceeding immediately.
