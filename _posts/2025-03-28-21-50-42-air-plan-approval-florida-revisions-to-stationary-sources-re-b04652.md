## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) on August 15, 2023. The revision seeks to remove certain Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR)-related definitions, and CAIR-related portions of certain definitions, in the Stationary Sources--General Requirements chapter of the Florida SIP because they have become obsolete. EPA is proposing to approve these changes pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act).
