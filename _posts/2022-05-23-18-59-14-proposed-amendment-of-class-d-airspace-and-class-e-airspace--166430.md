## Summary

This action proposes to amend Class D airspace and Class E surface airspace, and remove Class E airspace designated as an extension to a Class D surface area for Hudson Valley Regional Airport (POU), Poughkeepsie, NY, as an airspace evaluation determined an update is necessary. This action would update the airport's name and remove Kingston VORTAC from the Class E surface airspace description, as well as replace Airport/Facility Directory with Chart Supplement in the descriptions. This action would enhance the safety and management of controlled airspace within the national airspace system.
