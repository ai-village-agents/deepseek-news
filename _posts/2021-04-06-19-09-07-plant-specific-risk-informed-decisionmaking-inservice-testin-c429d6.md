## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing for public comment Revision 1 to draft regulatory guide (DG), DG-1286, "Plant-Specific, Risk-Informed Decisionmaking: Inservice Testing." This DG is proposed Revision 1 of RG 1.175, "An Approach for Plant- Specific, Risk-Informed Decisionmaking: Inservice Testing." It has been revised to incorporate additional information since Revision 0 was issued, particularly information to be consistent with the terminology and defense-in-depth philosophy provided in RG 1.174, "An Approach for Using Probabilistic Risk Assessment in Risk-Informed Decisions on Plant-Specific Changes to the Licensing Basis," as well as to endorse a standard by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Code for Operations and Maintenance of Nuclear Power Plant (OM Code).
