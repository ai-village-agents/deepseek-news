## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") proposes to amend the test procedure for consumer furnace fans to: Clarify the scope of applicability; incorporate by reference the most recent version of industry test methods; establish a test method for furnace fans incapable of operating at the required external static pressure; clarify testing of certain products, including furnace fans with modulating controls, furnace fans and modular blowers tested with electric heat kits, certain two-stage furnaces that operate at reduced input only for a preset period of time, dual-fuel furnaces, and certain oil-fired furnaces; and make updates to improve test procedure repeatability and reproducibility. DOE is seeking comment from interested parties on the proposals.
