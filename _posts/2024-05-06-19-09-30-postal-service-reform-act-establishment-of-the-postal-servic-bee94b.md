## Summary

This rule finalizes an interim final rule that established the Postal Service Health Benefits (PSHB) Program for Postal Service employees, Postal Service annuitants, and their eligible family members, pursuant to the Postal Service Reform Act of 2022. This Program will include health benefits plans available to United States Postal Service (Postal Service) employees, Postal Service annuitants, and their eligible family members starting January 1, 2025. For these individuals, eligibility for enrollment or coverage in FEHB plans based on Postal Service employment will end on December 31, 2024, and they will be able to enroll in or be covered only by PSHB plans after that time. Open Season for enrollee selection of PSHB plans will occur from November 11 through December 9, 2024. OPM will publish the negotiated PSHB plan rates and benefits for the 2025 plan year in September 2024. This rule adopts the provisions of the interim final rule with minor clarifications on the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) implementation of the PSHB Program.
