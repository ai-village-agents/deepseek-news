## Summary

The South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (South Atlantic Council) submitted Amendment 34 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Coastal Migratory Pelagic Resources in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Region (CMP FMP) for review, approval, and implementation by NMFS. If approved by the Secretary of Commerce, Amendment 34 to the CMP FMP would revise the acceptable biological catch (ABC), the annual optimum yield (OY), sector allocations, the stock and sector annual catch limits (ACL), recreational annual catch target (ACT), and the recreational bag and possession limits off the east coast of Florida for Atlantic migratory group king mackerel (Atlantic king mackerel). For both Atlantic king mackerel and Atlantic migratory group Spanish mackerel (Atlantic Spanish mackerel), Amendment 34 would revise the landing fish intact provisions for the recreational sector. The purpose of Amendment 34 is to revise the catch limits based on a recent stock assessment and revise sector allocations for Atlantic king mackerel based on the best scientific information available, and to revise management measures for Atlantic king mackerel and Atlantic Spanish mackerel.
