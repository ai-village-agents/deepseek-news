## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is proposing to amend the Veteran Readiness and Employment and Education regulations to implement the provisions of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Improvements Act of 2010, which modified the manner in which payments of educational assistance are determined and expanded the types of programs students may pursue under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. VA is also proposing to implement section 1002 of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009, which authorized the "Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship," and a select number of provisions of the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017. This proposed rule would include the rules necessary to implement provisions of other legislative enactments that affect the provision of educational assistance to veterans and their eligible dependents and beneficiaries.
