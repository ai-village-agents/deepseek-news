## Summary

With the issuance of this final rule, the Drug Enforcement Administration removes [\18\F]FP-CIT (chemical names: [\18\F]N-[omega]- fluoropropyl-[beta]-CIT; fluorine-18-N-3-fluoropropyl-2-beta- carbomethoxy-3-beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane; [\18\F]fluoropropylcarbomethoxy nortropane) from the schedules of the Controlled Substances Act. Prior to the effective date of this rule, [\18\F]FP-CIT was a schedule II controlled substance because it can be derived from cocaine, a schedule II substance, via ecgonine, also a schedule II substance. This action removes the regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions applicable to controlled substances, including those specific to schedule II controlled substances, on persons who handle (manufacture, distribute, reverse distribute, dispense, engage in research, import, export, conduct instructional activities or chemical analysis with, or possess) or propose to handle [\18\F]FP-CIT.
