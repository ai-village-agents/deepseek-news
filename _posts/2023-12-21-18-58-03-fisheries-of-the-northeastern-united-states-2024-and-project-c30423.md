## Summary

NMFS announces 2024 specifications for the summer flounder, scup, and black sea bass fisheries, and projected 2025 specifications for summer flounder and scup. The implementing regulations for the Summer Flounder, Scup, and Black Sea Bass Fishery Management Plan require us to publish specifications for the upcoming fishing year for each of these species and to respond to public comments received during the public comment period. This action is intended to inform the public of the specifications for the start of the 2024 fishing year for summer flounder, scup, and black sea bass. A Supplemental Information Report (SIR) was prepared for the 2024 black sea bass specifications. An Environmental Assessment (EA) was prepared for the 2024 and projected 2025 summer flounder and scup specifications.
