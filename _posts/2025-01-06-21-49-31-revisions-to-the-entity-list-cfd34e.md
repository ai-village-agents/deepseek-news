## Summary

In this rule, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by adding 13 entities under 13 entries to the Entity List. These entries are listed on the Entity List under the destinations of Burma (1), China, People's Republic of (China) (11), and Pakistan (1). These entities have been determined by the U.S. Government to be acting contrary to the national security and/ or foreign policy interests of the United States. This rule also amends the EAR by making certain editorial corrections and clarifications. BIS is making the corrections and clarifications in order to minimize confusion and not impede the free flow of commerce.
