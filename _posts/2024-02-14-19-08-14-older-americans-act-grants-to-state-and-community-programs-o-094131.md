## Summary

ACL is issuing this final rule to modernize the implementing regulations of the Older Americans Act of 1965 ("the Act" or OAA). These changes advance the policy goals of the Act as articulated by Congress, including equity in service delivery, accountability for funds expended, and clarity of administration for ACL and its grantees. This final rule ultimately facilitates improved service delivery and enhanced benefits for OAA participants, particularly those in greatest economic need and greatest social need consistent with the statute.
