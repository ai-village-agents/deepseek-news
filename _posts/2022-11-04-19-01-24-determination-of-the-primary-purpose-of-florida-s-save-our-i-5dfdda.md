## Summary

USDA is providing public notice that the Secretary of Agriculture has determined that cost share payments made by the Florida's SOIRL Program are primarily for the purpose of conserving soil and water resources or protecting and restoring the environment. NRCS was assigned technical and administrative responsibility for reviewing Florida's SOIRL Program and for making appropriate recommendations for the Secretary's determination of primary purpose. The Secretary's determination permits recipients of cost share payments to exclude such payments from gross income to the extent allowed by the Internal Revenue Service.
