## Summary

The United States has long been at the forefront of artificial intelligence (AI) innovation. Maintaining that leadership is a key national and economic security priority. AI infrastructure including data centers is a critical component of the modern economy, enabling AI training and inference, scientific research, and a wide range of other essential services. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is exploring opportunities to leverage its land assets to support the growing demand for AI infrastructure. This aligns with the policy laid out in the executive order signed January 23, 2025, titled "Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence," to sustain and enhance America's global AI dominance in order to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security.
