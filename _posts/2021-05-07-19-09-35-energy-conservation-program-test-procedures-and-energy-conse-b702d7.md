## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE" or "the Department") is restarting rulemaking activities to consider potential test procedures and energy conservation standards for circulator pumps and small vertical in-line pumps. Consensus recommendations for test procedures and energy conservation standards were negotiated in 2016 by a stakeholder working group of the Appliance Standards Rulemaking Federal Advisory Committee ("ASRAC"). Through this request for information ("RFI"), DOE seeks data and information regarding development and evaluation of new test procedures that would be reasonably designed to produce test results which reflect energy use during a representative average use cycle for the equipment without being unduly burdensome to conduct. Additionally, this RFI solicits information regarding the development and evaluation of potential new energy conservation standards for circulator pumps and small vertical in-line pumps, and whether such standards would result in significant energy savings and be technologically feasible and economically justified. DOE also welcomes written comments from the public on any subject within the scope of this document (including those topics not specifically raised), as well as the submission of data and other relevant information.
