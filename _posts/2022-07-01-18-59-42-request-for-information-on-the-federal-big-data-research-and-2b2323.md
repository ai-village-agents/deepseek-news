## Summary

The NITRD NCO and NSF, as part of the NITRD Big Data interagency working group (BD IWG), request input from all interested parties as the IWG prepares updates to the Federal Big Data Research and Development Strategic Plan. Through this RFI, the NITRD NCO seeks input from the public, including academia, government, business, and industry groups of all sizes; those directly performing Big Data research and development (R&D); and those directly affected by such R&D, on ways in which the strategic plan should be revised and improved. The public input provided in response to this RFI will assist the NITRD BD IWG in updating the Federal Big Data Research and Development Strategic Plan.
