## Summary

In response to a request for a changed circumstances review (CCR), the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is initiating a CCR of the antidumping duty (AD) order on finished carbon steel flanges (flanges) from India. We preliminarily determine that BFN Forgings Private Limited (BFN) is the successor-in-interest to Bebitz Flanges Works Private Limited (Bebitz). Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.
