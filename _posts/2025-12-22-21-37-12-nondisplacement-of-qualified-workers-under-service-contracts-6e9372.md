## Summary

On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued an Executive order rescinding certain Executive orders and actions, which revoked an Executive order concerning nondisplacement of qualified workers under Federal service contracts and directed the heads of each agency to take immediate steps to effectuate the revocations listed. In accordance with this directive, the Department of Labor is issuing a final rule to rescind the regulations on nondisplacement of qualified workers under service contracts, which were promulgated solely pursuant to the authority provided by the revoked Executive order.
