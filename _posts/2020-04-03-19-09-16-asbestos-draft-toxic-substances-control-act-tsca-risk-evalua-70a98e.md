## Summary

EPA is announcing the availability of and soliciting public comment on the draft Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) risk evaluation of asbestos. EPA is also submitting the same document to the TSCA Science Advisory Committee on Chemicals (SACC) for peer review and is announcing that there will be two virtual public meetings of the TSCA SACC, with participation by phone and webcast only, and no in- person gathering. The first virtual public meeting will be a preparatory meeting for the SACC to consider the scope and clarity of the draft charge questions for the peer review. This will be followed by the peer review virtual public meeting for the SACC to consider and review the draft risk evaluation. The purpose of conducting risk evaluations under TSCA is to determine whether a chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment under the conditions of use, including an unreasonable risk to a relevant potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation.
