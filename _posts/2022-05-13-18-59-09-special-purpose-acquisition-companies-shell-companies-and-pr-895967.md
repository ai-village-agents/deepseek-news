## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") is proposing rules intended to enhance investor protections in initial public offerings by special purpose acquisition companies ("SPACs") and in subsequent business combination transactions between SPACs and private operating companies. Specifically, we are proposing specialized disclosure requirements with respect to, among other things, compensation paid to sponsors, conflicts of interest, dilution, and the fairness of these business combination transactions. The proposed new rules and amendments to certain rules and forms under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 would address the application of disclosure, underwriter liability, and other provisions in the context of, and specifically address concerns associated with, business combination transactions involving SPACs as well as the scope of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Further, we are proposing a rule that would deem any business combination transaction involving a reporting shell company, including a SPAC, to involve a sale of securities to the reporting shell company's shareholders and are proposing to amend a number of financial statement requirements applicable to transactions involving shell companies. In addition, we are proposing to update our guidance regarding the use of projections in Commission filings as well as to require additional disclosure regarding projections when used in connection with business combination transactions involving SPACs. Finally, we are proposing a new safe harbor under the Investment Company Act of 1940 that would provide that a SPAC that satisfies the conditions of the proposed rule would not be an investment company and therefore would not be subject to regulation under that Act.
