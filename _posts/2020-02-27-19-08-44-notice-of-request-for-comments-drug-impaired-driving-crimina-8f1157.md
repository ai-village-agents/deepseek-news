## Summary

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is engaged in numerous activities to reduce drug-impaired driving, including conducting research and developing tools, resources, and promising practices to assist States and local communities. To aid in evaluating efforts to address drug-impaired driving, NHTSA has developed the Drug-Impaired Driving Criminal Justice Evaluation Tool. The tool is designed to assist with identifying program strengths and opportunities for improvements. After asking two organizations to test the model to explore weaknesses and identify areas for refinement, NHTSA now wishes to learn from other practitioners about any improvements and refinements that could add value to the tool. This notice requests comment on the completeness and usability of the tool.
