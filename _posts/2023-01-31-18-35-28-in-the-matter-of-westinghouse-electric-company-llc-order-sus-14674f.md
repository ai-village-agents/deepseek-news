## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing an Order to Westinghouse Electric Company LLC suspending NRC license XCOM1252, which authorizes the export of fuel assembly components to Sweden for fabrication of fuel assemblies and subsequent shipment of the completed fuel assemblies to the Republic of South Africa (RSA) for use in Koeberg Nuclear Power Station Units 1 and 2. The suspension is required because the license was issued, in part, based on assurances from the RSA that the components would be made subject to the terms of the Agreement for Cooperation in Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy (123 Agreement) between the United States (U.S.) and the Government of South Africa. However, the U.S.-RSA 123 Agreement expired on December 4, 2022, and therefore the assurances that supported issuance of the license are no longer valid.
