## Summary

As a result of the determinations by the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) orders on sodium nitrite from the Federal Republic of Germany (Germany) and the People's Republic of China (China) would likely lead to the continuation or recurrence of dumping, and material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation of these AD orders.
