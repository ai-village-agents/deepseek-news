## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for certain waters of the Potomac River. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters at the old Governor Harry W. Nice/Senator Thomas "Mac" Middleton Memorial (US- 301) Bridge during demolition operations from February 1, 2023 through February 14, 2023. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port, Maryland-National Capital Region or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
