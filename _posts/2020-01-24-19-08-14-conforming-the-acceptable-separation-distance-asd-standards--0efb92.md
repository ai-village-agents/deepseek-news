## Summary

This final rule reduces regulatory and cost burden on communities that may be restricted in their ability to site HUD- assisted projects, by allowing HUD-assisted projects near stationary aboveground propane storage tanks with a capacity of 1,000 gallons or less if the storage tanks comply with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 58 (2017). Based on consideration of public comments, HUD is adopting this 1,000-gallon limit in lieu of the 250- gallon limit contemplated in the proposed rule. This final rule incorporates by reference NFPA 58 (2017), a voluntary consensus standard for public safety that establishes safety standards used by the propane industry and operators regarding storage, handling, transportation, and use of propane.
