## Summary

FSIS is amending its regulations to expand the circumstances under which it will generically approve the labels of meat, poultry, and egg products. Also, as of the effective date of this final rule, FSIS will no longer evaluate generically approved labels that establishments and egg products plants voluntarily submit for FSIS review. FSIS is also announcing the availability of revised guidelines on the types of labels that must be submitted to FSIS for approval.
