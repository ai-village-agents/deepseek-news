## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Leonardo S.p.A. Model A119 and AW119 MKII helicopters. This AD was prompted by reports of trapped residue in the rear pneumatic line due to a non-optimal cleaning procedure. This AD requires accomplishing repetitive engine acceleration checks and, depending on the results, replacing the rear pneumatic line and inspecting the fuel control unit (FCU), and accomplishing any necessary corrective actions. This AD also requires replacing certain parts if the engine acceleration check exceeds the maximum limit, which terminates the repetitive acceleration checks. If the limits do not exceed the maximum limit, this AD would allow this replacement as an optional terminating action. Additionally, this AD prohibits installing an affected engine or FCU on a helicopter unless certain requirements are met. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
