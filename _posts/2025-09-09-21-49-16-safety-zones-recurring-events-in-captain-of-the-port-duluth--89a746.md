## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to revise existing regulations for recurring safety zones in the Captain of the Port Duluth Zone. The proposed amendments would update the table of annually recurring marine events, add definitions, and clarify how and when the COTP may enforce listed zones. These changes are intended to improve the timeliness and clarity of public notification, enhance mariner situational awareness, and promote the safety of life on the navigable waters of the western Great Lakes during recurring near-shore events. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
