## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC or Commission) proposes to update its regulations regarding exemptions for certain systems of records from one or more provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (Privacy Act). The Commission proposes to revise these regulations to specifically identify the systems of records currently included in the regulation that the Commission is exempting, additional systems of records that the Commission intends to exempt, and the sections of the Privacy Act from which the Commission is exempting each system of records, and the reasons therefor, in order to better conform to the requirements of the Privacy Act and the guidance contained in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-108, Federal Agency Responsibilities for Review, Reporting, and Publication Under the Privacy Act (OMB A-108). The Commission also proposes to reorganize the regulations for ease of reference.
