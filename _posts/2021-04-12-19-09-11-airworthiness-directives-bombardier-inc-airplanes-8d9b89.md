## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-1A10 and BD-700-1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of one or both roll control input modules (RCIMs) being incorrectly installed. This AD requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate certain aircraft maintenance manual (AMM) tasks. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
