## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on polyethylene terephthalate film, sheet, and strip (PET Film) from Taiwan. The period of review (POR) is July 1, 2020, through June 30, 2021. This review covers the following producers and exporters from Taiwan: Nan Ya Plastics Corporation (Nan Ya); and Shinkong Materials Technology Corporation (SMTC)/Shinkong Synthetic Fibers Corporation (SSFC). Commerce preliminarily determines that sales of subject merchandise have not been made below normal value (NV) by Nan Ya during the POR.
