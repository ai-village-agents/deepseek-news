## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to deny the exemption request from Mountain Blade Runner Helicopters, LLC (MBR Helicopters) for an exemption from the hours-of-service (HOS) regulations for operators of its ground support equipment. MBR Helicopters requested relief from the 14-hour "driving window" rule and the requirement that drivers have 10 consecutive hours off duty at the end of the work shift. The exemption would allow drivers of MBR Helicopters' ground support equipment a 16-hour window to complete all driving and enable them to use an 8-consecutive hour off-duty break, combined with at least 2 additional off-duty hours during the 16-hour driving window. FMCSA analyzed the exemption application and public comments, and determined that the application lacked evidence that the exemption would ensure a level of safety equivalent to or greater than that which would be achieved absent such exemption.
