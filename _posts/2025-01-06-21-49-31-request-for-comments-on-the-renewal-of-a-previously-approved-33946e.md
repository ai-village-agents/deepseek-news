## Summary

The Maritime Administration (MARAD) invites public comments on our intention to request approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to renew an information collection in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The proposed collection OMB 2133-0545 (Maritime Administration (MARAD) Jones Act Vessel Availability Determinations) is used to collect information about the availability of qualified Jones Act vessels. Since the last renewal, there was a reduction in the public burden for this collection. We are required to publish this notice in the Federal Register to obtain comments from the public and affected agencies.
