## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing exemptions from NRC regulations and associated license amendment related to requests from Westinghouse Electric Company, LLC (WEC) and US Ecology, Inc. (USEI). WEC requested NRC approval for an alternate disposal and related exemptions for specified low-activity radioactive waste from the Columbia Fuel Fabrication Facility (CFFF) in Hopkins, South Carolina containing byproduct material and special nuclear material (SNM) under License Number SNM-1107. Additionally, the NRC is approving exemptions requested by USEI from the applicable licensing requirements to allow USEI to receive and dispose of the material from CFFF without an NRC license. The USEI disposal facility, located near Grand View, Idaho, is a Subtitle C Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous waste disposal facility permitted by the State of Idaho to receive low-level radioactive waste. Approval of the alternate disposal request from WEC and the exemptions and license amendment requested by WEC, and associated exemptions requested by USEI would allow WEC to transfer the specific waste from CFFF to USEI for disposal.
