## Summary

This proposed rule would revise the Department of Commerce (Department) regulations under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Privacy Act. The revisions would clarify and update the language of procedural requirements pertaining to the inclusion of Social Security account numbers (SSNs) on documents that the Department sends by mail. These revisions are necessary to implement the Social Security Number Fraud Prevention Act of 2017, which restricts the inclusion of Social Security Numbers (SSNs) on documents sent by mail by the Federal Government.
