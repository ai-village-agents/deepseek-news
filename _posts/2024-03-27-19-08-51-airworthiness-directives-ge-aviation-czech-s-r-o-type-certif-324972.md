## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all GE Aviation Czech s.r.o. (GEAC) (type certificate previously held by WALTER Engines a.s., Walter a.s., and MOTORLET a.s.) Model M601D-11, M601E-11, M601E-11A, M601E-11AS, M601E-11S, and M601F engines. This AD was prompted by a report of a crack on the centrifugal compressor case mount pad weld area, caused by a non-conforming welding (lack of welding penetration). This AD requires a one-time detailed visual inspection of the compressor case pad welds for any crack, and replacement of the compressor case if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference (IBR). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
