## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is considering terminating a class waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule (NMR) for irradiation apparatus manufacturing, computerized axial tomography (CT/ CAT) scanners manufacturing; CT/CAT (computerized axial tomography) scanners manufacturing; fluoroscopes manufacturing; fluoroscopic X-ray apparatus and tubes manufacturing; generators, X-ray, manufacturing; irradiation equipment manufacturing; X-ray generators manufacturing; and X-ray irradiation equipment manufacturing under manufacturing categorized under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334517 and Product Service Code (PSC) 6525. An awardee of a Federal small business set-aside contract valued over $250,000.00, service-disabled veteran-owned small business contract, HUBZone contract, women-owned small business contract, or 8(a) contract must provide its own product or that of a small business manufacturer unless a waiver is in place. If the above-identified class waiver is terminated, small businesses will no longer be authorized to provide the product of any manufacturer regardless of size on the identified items, unless a Federal contracting officer obtains an individual waiver to the NMR.
