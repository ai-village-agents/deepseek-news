## Summary

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is amending its regulations governing deposit insurance coverage. The amendments simplify the deposit insurance regulations by establishing a "trust accounts" category that governs coverage of deposits of both revocable trusts and irrevocable trusts using a common calculation, and provide consistent deposit insurance treatment for all mortgage servicing account balances held to satisfy principal and interest obligations to a lender.
