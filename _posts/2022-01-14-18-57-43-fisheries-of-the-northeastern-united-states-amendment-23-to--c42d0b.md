## Summary

NMFS announces that the New England Fishery Management Council has transmitted Amendment 23 to the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan, incorporating the Environmental Impact Statement and the Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, for review by the Secretary of Commerce, and is requesting comments from the public. This action would adjust the existing industry-funded at-sea monitoring program for groundfish sectors to improve the accuracy of collected catch data (landings and discards) and catch accounting in order to better determine total catch and effort and achieve coverage levels sufficient to minimize effects of potential monitoring bias. The measures recommended by the New England Fishery Management Council in Amendment 23 are intended to ensure there is a precise and accurate representation of catch to set catch limits at levels that prevent overfishing and to determine when catch limits are exceeded.
