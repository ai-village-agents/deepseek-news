## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on November 26, 2021. The collection involves FAA Form 8400- 3, Application for an Airman Certificate and/or Rating, (for flight engineer and flight navigator) and applications for approval of related training courses that are submitted to FAA for evaluation. The information collection is necessary to determine applicant eligibility for flight engineer or flight navigator certificates. This collection is also necessary to determine training course acceptability for those schools training flight engineers or navigators.
