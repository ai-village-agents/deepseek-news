## Summary

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, invites the general public to take this opportunity to comment on a revision of a currently approved information collection. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice seeks comments concerning the charge to FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to meet FEMA strategic priorities, and FEMA's program management to improve the public's knowledge and actions for preparedness and resilience. Information from this collection will be used to track changes in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to preparedness in the general public. The Individual and Community Preparedness Division analyzes and uses data collected in FEMA Form 008-0-15, National Disaster Preparedness Survey to identify progress and gaps in individual and community preparedness to better understand the motivators and barriers to preparedness in general and about specific hazards. The survey measures the public's knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors relative to preparing for a wide range of hazards.
