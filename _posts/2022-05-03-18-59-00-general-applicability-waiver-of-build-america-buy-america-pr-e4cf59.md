## Summary

In accordance with the Build America, Buy America Act, this notice advises that HUD is proposing a general applicability waiver for one year to the Buy America Domestic Content Procurement Preference ("Buy America Preference," or "BAP") as applied to Federal Financial Assistance provided to Tribes, Tribally Designated Housing Entities (TDHEs), and other Tribal Entities. In accordance with the Act, HUD has found that this general applicability waiver is in the public interest, as it provides the Department with the opportunity to first engage in consultation as described in HUD's Tribal Government- to-Government Consultation Policy, consistent with President Biden's "Tribal Consultation and Strengthening Nation-to-Nation Relationships" Memorandum regarding the potential application of BAP to such entities.
