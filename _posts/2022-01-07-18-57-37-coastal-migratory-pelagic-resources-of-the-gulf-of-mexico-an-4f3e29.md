## Summary

NMFS corrects the temporary rule that published in the Federal Register on January 3, 2022, which announced the incorrect effective date of January 3, 2022, for the closure of the Atlantic southern zone to commercial harvest of Spanish mackerel. The correct effective date for the closure is January 5, 2022. NMFS identified several errors with references to incorrect dates, so the purpose of this correction is to fix those errors.
