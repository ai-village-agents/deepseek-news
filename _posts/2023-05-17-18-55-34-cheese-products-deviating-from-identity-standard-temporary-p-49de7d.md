## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is announcing the extension of a temporary permit issued to Bongards Creameries (the applicant) to market test several pasteurized standardized cheeses that deviate from the U.S. standards of identity for cheese products. The extension allows the applicant to continue to evaluate commercial viability of the products and to collect data on consumer acceptance of the products, in support of a petition to amend the standard of identity for cheese products. We also invite other interested parties to participate in the market test.
