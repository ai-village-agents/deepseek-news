## Summary

This action extends the comment period for the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), Drug and Alcohol Testing of Certificated Repair Station Employees Located Outside of the United States. On December 7, 2023, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published this proposed rule. The NPRM would require certificated repair stations located outside the territory of the United States whose employees perform safety-sensitive maintenance functions on certain air carrier aircraft to obtain and implement a drug and alcohol testing program in accordance with the requirements of the Drug and Alcohol Testing Program published by the FAA and the Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs published by the Department of Transportation. The FAA is extending the comment period for this NPRM to allow commenters additional time to analyze the proposed rule and prepare a response.
