## Summary

This notification announces receipt of and publishes a petition for waiver and interim waiver from Johnson Controls Inc. ("JCI"), which seeks a waiver for specified basic models of central air conditioners ("CACs") and central air conditioning heat pumps ("HPs") (collectively, "CAC/HPs") from the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") test procedure used for determining the efficiency of CAC/HPs. According to JCI, testing its CAC/HP basic models that use variable-speed, oil-injected scroll compressors with only a 20-hour break-in period produces results unrepresentative of their true energy consumption characteristics, and would provide materially inaccurate comparative data. JCI requested that in lieu of the 20-hour break-in limit, it be permitted to test the specified CAC/HP basic models with a 72-hour break-in period. DOE also gives notification of an Interim Waiver Order that requires JCI to test and rate the specified CAC/HP basic models in accordance with the alternate test procedure set forth in the Interim Waiver Order. DOE solicits comments, data, and information concerning JCI's petition and its suggested alternate test procedure so as to inform DOE's final decision on JCI's waiver request.
