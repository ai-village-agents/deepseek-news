## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are listing the prostrate milkweed (Asclepias prostrata), a plant species from Texas, as an endangered species and designating critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). We are designating approximately 661.0 acres (267.5 hectares) in Starr and Zapata Counties, Texas, as critical habitat for the prostrate milkweed under the Act. This rule adds this species to the List of Endangered and Threatened Plants and extends the Act's protections to the species and its designated critical habitat.
