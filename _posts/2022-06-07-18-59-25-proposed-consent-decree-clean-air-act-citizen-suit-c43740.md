## Summary

In accordance with the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA or the Act), notice is given of two proposed consent decrees: one would resolve all claims in Concerned Citizens of St. John, et al. v Regan, No. 21-cv-03063-TNM (D.D.C.) ("CCSJ Matter"), as well as the same claims brought in Environmental Integrity Project, et al. v. Regan, No. 20-cv-03119-TNM (D.D.C.) ("EIP Matter"), and the second proposed consent decree would resolve all other claims in the EIP Matter. The two cases are now consolidated, and the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA" or "the Agency") is providing notice of these two proposed consent decrees that would resolve all claims in both cases by establishing deadlines for EPA to take proposed and final actions on, in the first consent decree, the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants ("NESHAP") for the Group I Polymers & Resins ("P&R I") source category, and in the second, certain New Source Performance Standards ("NSPS") and NESHAP specified in that decree.
