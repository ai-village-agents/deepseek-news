## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model MD-11 and MD-11F airplanes. This AD was prompted by an accident where the left-hand engine and pylon detached from the airplane during takeoff. This AD prohibits further flight until the airplane is inspected and all applicable corrective actions are performed using a method approved by the FAA. The FAA previously sent an emergency AD to all known U.S. owners and operators of these airplanes. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
