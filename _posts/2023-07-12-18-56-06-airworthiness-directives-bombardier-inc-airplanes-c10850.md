## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-03- 06, which applied to all Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-1A10 and BD- 700-1A11 airplanes. AD 2023-03-06 required revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to incorporate limitations to mitigate identified hazards when in the presence of interference from wireless broadband operations in the 3.7-3.98 GHz frequency band (5G C-Band) as identified by Notices to Air Missions (NOTAMs). Since the FAA issued AD 2023-03-06, the FAA determined that additional limitations are needed due to the continued deployment of new 5G C-Band stations whose signals are expected to cover most of the contiguous United States at transmission frequencies between 3.7-3.98 GHz. This AD requires revising the limitations section of the existing AFM to incorporate limitations prohibiting dispatch under a certain master minimum equipment list (MMEL) item. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
