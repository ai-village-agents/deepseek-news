The U.S. Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute (AISI), housed within NIST at the Department of Commerce, requests comments on an updated draft document responsive to Section 4.1(a)(ii) and Section 4.1(a)(ii)(A) of Executive Order 14110 on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) issued on October 30, 2023 (E.O. 14110). This draft document, NIST AI 800-1, Managing Misuse Risk for Dual-Use Foundation Models, can be found at https:// nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.800-1.ipd2.pdf. This document is an update to an initial public draft and includes changes based on the previous round of public comment, as well as two new appendices that apply these guidelines to (1) chemical and biological misuse risk and (2) cyber misuse risk.
