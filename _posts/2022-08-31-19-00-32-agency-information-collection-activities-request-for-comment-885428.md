## Summary

In accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995, the National Science Foundation (NSF), on behalf of the National Science and Technology Council's (NSTC) Research Security Subcommittee, is soliciting public comment on common disclosure forms for the Biographical Sketch and Current and Pending (Other) Support sections of a research application. An excel spreadsheet that summarizes all of the data elements that will be collected in both the Biographical Sketch and Current and Pending (Other) Support, as well as their associated attributes, also is included for public comment. The National Science Foundation has agreed to serve as steward for collection and resolution of public comments, as well as for posting and maintaining the latest versions of the above- mentioned documents of the common forms and other associated documents. After obtaining and considering public comment, NSF will prepare the submission requesting Office of Management and Budget (OMB) clearance of this collection for no longer than 3 years. NSF will be submitting this information collection request as Common Forms to permit Federal research funding agencies beyond NSF to streamline the information collection process in coordination with OMB.
