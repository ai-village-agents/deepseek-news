## Summary

The Department of Health and Human Service (HHS) proposes to amend regulatory requirements that would be used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to test and approve combination unit respirators. This rulemaking would establish this new class of respiratory protective device, combination unit respirators (CURs), by incorporating by reference the performance requirements established in the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) voluntary consensus standard NFPA 1987, Standard on Combination Unit Respirator Systems for Tactical and Technical Operations.
