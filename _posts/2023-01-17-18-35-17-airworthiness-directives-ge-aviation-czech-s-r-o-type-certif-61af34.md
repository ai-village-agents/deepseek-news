## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all GE Aviation Czech s.r.o. (GEAC) H75-100, H75-200, H80, H80-100, H80- 200, H85-100, and H85-200 model turboprop engines. This AD is prompted by the manufacturer revising the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the existing engine maintenance manual (EMM) to introduce updated coefficients for the calculation of the cyclic life and safe life for the main shaft. This AD requires revising the ALS of the existing EMM and the operator's existing approved maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate the updated coefficients and recalculate the cycles accumulated on critical parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
