## Summary

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is revising the OMB Guidance for Grants and Agreements, which is now called the OMB Guidance for Federal Financial Assistance. The final guidance reflects public comments received in response to the OMB Notification of Proposed Guidance published in October 2023 and comments received from Federal agencies. In response to comments, OMB is revising and updating the guidance to incorporate recent OMB policy priorities related to Federal financial assistance and to reduce agency and recipient burden. OMB is also incorporating certain statutory requirements and clarifying certain sections of the prior version of the guidance that recipients or agencies have interpreted in different ways. OMB is also making revisions to use plain language, improve flow, and address inconsistent use of terms within the guidance text. Finally, OMB is making revisions to improve Federal financial assistance management, transparency, and oversight through more accessible and readily comprehensible guidance.
