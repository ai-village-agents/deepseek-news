## Summary

The Department of Labor (Department) proposes to remove parts located in Title 29, Chapter V, Subchapter B of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) that were not originally issued, or subsequently amended, through notice-and-comment rulemaking. Because these parts consist of interpretive rules and policy statements regarding the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) which do not carry the force and effect of law, the Department believes that these parts, to the extent that they have not benefitted from public comment, should be repurposed as sub- regulatory guidance. The Department seeks comment on what provisions in Subchapter B should be retained in the CFR, as well as what kind of sub-regulatory guidance the Department should use to preserve interpretive rules and policy statements that are removed from the CFR. This summary can be found at https://www.regulations.gov by searching by the RIN: 1235-AA52.
