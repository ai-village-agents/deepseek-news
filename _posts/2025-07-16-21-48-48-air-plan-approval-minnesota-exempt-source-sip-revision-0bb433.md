## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the Minnesota State Implementation Plan (SIP) which updates Minnesota's air program rules. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) submitted the request to EPA on October 1, 2021. The revision to Minnesota's air quality rules will reflect changes that have occurred to the State air quality rules since July 2020. EPA is proposing to approve MPCA's submittal, which will result in consistent requirements of rules at both the State and Federal level.
