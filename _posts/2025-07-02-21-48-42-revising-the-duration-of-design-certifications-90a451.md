## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its regulations to revise the duration of design certifications (DCs). Specifically, this proposed rule would replace the 15-year duration for DCs with a 40-year duration period, both for existing DCs currently in effect and generically for future DCs, including renewals. This proposed rule would not change the date of issuance or renewal for existing DCs (i.e., the start date by which an existing DC may be referenced would remain unchanged). The proposed rule would also incorporate a minor editorial correction.
