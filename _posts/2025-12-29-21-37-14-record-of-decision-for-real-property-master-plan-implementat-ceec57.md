## Summary

The Department of the Army (Army) announces the availability of a Record of Decision (ROD) regarding the proposed implementation of real property actions at Military Ocean Terminal Sunny Point (MOTSU), North Carolina. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the ROD identifies the Army's selected alternative, the basis for its selection, the environmentally preferred alternative, and the mitigation and protective measures the Army commits to implement with the selected alternative. The ROD is based on the results of the Army's Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which analyzed the potential effects of the implementation of various projects needed for the safety and mission of the facility and provides an analysis of the effects of implementing real property maintenance, repair, upgrade, and development actions. The proposed action is needed to address improvements to real property related to explosive safety, waterfront maintenance, security, and linear infrastructure. The projects and programs address compliance with federal, state, DoD, and Army standards vital to safety, security, and other mission needs. The EIS includes a final Finding of No Practicable Alternative (FONPA) prepared because portions of the proposed action occur in floodplains or involve construction in wetlands, or both.
