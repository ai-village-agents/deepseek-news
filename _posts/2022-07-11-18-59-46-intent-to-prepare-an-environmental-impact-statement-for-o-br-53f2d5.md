## Summary

The DoD announces its intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to assess the potential effects associated with proposed access and infrastructure upgrades at the National Security Agency's (NSA) campus on Fort George G. Meade, Maryland (hereafter referred to as Fort Meade). The purpose of the proposed project is to increase efficiencies and capacity for required security processing of deliveries and traffic entering the NSA campus. Additionally, major construction projects have generated changes in Fort Meade traffic distribution, resulting in extensive delays for inspection and access. Publication of this notice begins a scoping process that identifies and determines the scope of environmental issues to be addressed in the EIS. This notice requests public participation in the scoping process and provides information on how to participate.
