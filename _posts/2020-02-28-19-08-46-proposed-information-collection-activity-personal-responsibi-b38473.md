## Summary

A goal of the Performance Measures and Adulthood Preparation Subjects (PMAPS) studies is to collect, analyze, and report on performance measure data for the Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP) programs. The Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation (OPRE) and the Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB) in the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) request a revision to a currently approved information collection (OMB No. 0970-0497; expiration date: 04/30/2020). The purpose of the request is to make adaptions to the participant entry and exit surveys, and continue the ongoing data collection of the performance measures from PREP grantees.
