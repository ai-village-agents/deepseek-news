## Summary

The Office for Victims of Crime ("OVC") is promulgating this final rule for its International Terrorism Victim Expense Reimbursement Program ("ITVERP"), in order to finalize the interim final rule published on April 11, 2011, which removed a regulatory limitation on the discretion of the Director of OVC to accept claims filed more than three years after the date that an incident is designated as an incident of international terrorism. This final rule also makes non- substantive technical corrections to update citations to reflect the current location of the cited provisions.
