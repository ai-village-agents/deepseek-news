## Summary

The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) will convene a virtual listening session on the drivers and consequences of excessive screen use in schools, including the growing reliance on individual devices and educational technology services and applications. The discussion will also examine how federal law, broadband funding, and other federal programs may influence school- based device and digital platform use. This session will gather input from stakeholders and subject matter experts to inform NTIA's future planning, policy development, and programming related to federal broadband and communications policy and its relationship to children's technology usage. Insights from this discussion will inform NTIA research assessing the impacts of excessive screen use in schools, the role of federal rules and federal funding in shaping device and platform markets, and the practices surrounding the collection and use of children's data by education technology platforms.
