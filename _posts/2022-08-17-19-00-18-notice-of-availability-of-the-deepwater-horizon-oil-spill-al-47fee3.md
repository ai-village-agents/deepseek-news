## Summary

This Alabama Trustee Implementation Group (TIG) Alabama Swift Tract Living Shoreline Project: Final Supplemental Environmental Assessment (Final Supplemental EA) describes, and in conjunction with the associated Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI), selects the preferred restoration alternative, which consists of the removal of rocks from the Bon Secour Bay bottom near the original Swift Tract Living Shoreline Project's action area and the placement of the removed rocks on a nearby breakwater. The proposed action falls within the general scope of the purpose and need for the original Swift Tract Living Shoreline Project, which was identified and evaluated in the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Programmatic and Phase III Early Restoration Plan and Early Restoration Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (Phase III ERP/PEIS). The proposed action is also consistent with the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Final Programmatic Damage Assessment and Restoration Plan and Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PDARP/PEIS), as it focuses on the restoration of injuries to Alabama's natural resources and services--in particular to Restoration Type: "Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats," using funds made available in early restoration and through the DWH Consent Decree. The Federal Trustees of the Alabama TIG have determined that the implementation of the Final Supplemental EA is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment within the context of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Therefore, they have concluded a FONSI is appropriate, and, therefore, an Environmental Impact Statement will not be prepared.
