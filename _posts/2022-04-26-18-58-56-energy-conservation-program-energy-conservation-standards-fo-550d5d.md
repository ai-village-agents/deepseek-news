# Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Commercial Warm Air Furnaces

## Summary

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended ("EPCA"), prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment, including commercial warm air furnaces ("CWAFs"). EPCA also requires the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") to periodically review standards. In this notification of proposed determination ("NOPD"), DOE has initially determined that it lacks clear and convincing evidence that amended energy conservation standards for CWAFs would be economically justified. DOE requests comment on this proposed determination.
