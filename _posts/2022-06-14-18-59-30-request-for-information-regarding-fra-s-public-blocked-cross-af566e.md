## Summary

Section 22404 of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), requires FRA to maintain a blocked crossing portal to receive information from the public regarding blocked highway-rail grade crossings. Section 22404 of BIL also requires FRA to submit a report that describes the nature of blocked highway-rail grade crossings, FRA's process for reviewing and using information received through the blocked crossing portal, FRA's engagement with affected parties, and whether the blocked crossing portal continues to be an effective method to collect blocked crossing information and what changes could improve its effectiveness. This RFI is soliciting comments on how FRA's engagement with affected parties and changes to the portal and related operations can improve the effectiveness of the portal.
