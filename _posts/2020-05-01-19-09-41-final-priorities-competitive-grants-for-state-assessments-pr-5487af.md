## Summary

The Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education announces priorities under the Competitive Grants for State Assessments (CGSA) program, Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) number 84.368A. The Assistant Secretary may use these priorities for a competition in fiscal year (FY) 2020 and in later years. We take this action to focus Federal financial assistance related to student assessments on innovative assessments. We intend the priorities to increase the number of States requesting and, then, using flexibility under the Innovative Assessment Demonstration Authority (IADA) and to support high-quality work among those States that do so. Given the national emergency related to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), flexible approaches to education, including innovative, formative, and competency-based assessments such as those that these priorities will support, are essential for students, parents, and educators.
