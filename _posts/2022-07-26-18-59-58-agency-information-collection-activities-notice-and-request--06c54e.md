## Summary

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) invites public comments about our intention to request approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for an extension of a currently approved information collection. Before a Federal agency can collect certain information from the public, it must receive approval from OMB. Under procedures established by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, before seeking OMB approval, Federal agencies must solicit public comment on proposed collections of information, including extensions and reinstatement of previously approved collections. This document describes a collection of information for which NHTSA intends to seek OMB approval and solicits public comments on continuation of the requirements for the collection of information entitled "Consolidated Child Restraint System Registration for Defect Notifications and Labeling" (OMB Control Number: 2127-0576) and the accuracy of the agency's revised estimates of the burden of the information collections.
