## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A330-200, A330-200 Freighter, A330-300, A330- 800, and A330-900 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by an incorrect shot peening application being implemented in production starting from 2008. This AD requires repetitive detailed inspections (DET) of certain splice fittings and, depending on findings, repair. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
