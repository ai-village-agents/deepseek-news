## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R), gives notice of a proposed revision of an existing Privacy Act system of records. The system of records is being updated in support of a follow-up information collection with the participants of the Homeless Families Impact Study (now called the Family Options Study). The overall goal of the Family Options Study is to determine which housing and service intervention works best to promote housing stability, family preservation, and family well-being, and self-sufficiency for homeless families with children. The new information collected will be added to the existing Homeless Families Impact Study Data Files. The Department proposes to expand the data collected under the previous study to capture additional data to determine the effects that housing and service interventions have had on the young children who are part of the sample. Refer to the "Categories of Records" section to identify new record types. Additionally, this Notice updates the routine uses of the data collected. This notice supersedes the previously published notice (February 26, 2014; FR-5763-N-02).
