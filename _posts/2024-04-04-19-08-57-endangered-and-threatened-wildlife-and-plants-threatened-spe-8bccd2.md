## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are reopening the public comment period on our October 3, 2023, proposed rule to list the northwestern pond turtle (Actinemys marmorata), a species from Washington, Oregon, Nevada, and northern and central California, and the southwestern pond turtle (Actinemys pallida), a species from central and southern California and Baja California, Mexico, as threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). We are taking this action to allow all interested parties an additional opportunity to comment on the proposed listing of the two species and the proposed rule issued under section 4(d) of the Act ("4(d) rule") for the species. Comments previously submitted need not be resubmitted and will be fully considered in our final determinations.
