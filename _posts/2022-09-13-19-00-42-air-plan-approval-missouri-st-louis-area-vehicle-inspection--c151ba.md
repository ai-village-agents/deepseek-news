## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve, through parallel processing, revisions to the Missouri State Implementation Plan (SIP) relating to the St. Louis area's vehicle Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) Program received on November 12, 2019, March 2, 2022, and May 24, 2022. In the submissions, Missouri requests the EPA's approval of revisions to a regulation and related plan that implement the St. Louis area's Inspection and Maintenance program called, Gateway Vehicle Inspection Program (GVIP). We are approving Missouri's removal of vehicles registered in Franklin County, unless the vehicle is primarily operated in the rest of the area, from the Gateway Vehicle Inspection Program. The revisions to this rule include amending the rule exemption section for vehicles subject to the rule, removing unnecessary words, amending definitions specific to the rule, updates due to technology changes, and other minor edits. These revisions do not interfere with attainment or maintenance of any National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), reasonable further progress, or other Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements. Approval of these revisions will ensure consistency between state and federally approved rules.
