## Summary

Pursuant to its authority under title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is modifying its regulations governing procedures related to administrative protective orders (APO) and service of documents submitted in antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) proceedings. Specifically, Commerce is making certain changes to its procedures governing the filing of documents (including public documents, business proprietary documents, and public versions of business proprietary documents), as well as service of documents. Commerce is also making additional clarifications and corrections to other procedural aspects of its AD/CVD regulations, including updates to the scope, circumvention, and covered merchandise referral regulations. Lastly, Commerce is deleting from its regulations two provisions that have been invalidated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit).
