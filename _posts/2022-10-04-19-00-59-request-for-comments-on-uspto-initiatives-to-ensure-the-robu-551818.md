## Summary

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO or Office) seeks initial public comments on proposed initiatives directed at bolstering the robustness and reliability of patents to incentivize and protect new and nonobvious inventions while facilitating the broader dissemination of public knowledge to promote innovation and competition. This request for comments (RFC) addresses a variety of topics, including prior art searching, support for claimed subject matter, request for continued examination (RCE) practice, and restriction practice, and certain initiatives related to these topics that are outlined in the USPTO's July 6, 2022, letter to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This RFC also seeks comments on the questions set forth in a June 8, 2022, letter to the USPTO from six United States Senators. The USPTO is studying additional topics and initiatives to bolster the robustness and reliability of U.S. patents and will seek public comments on those separately.
