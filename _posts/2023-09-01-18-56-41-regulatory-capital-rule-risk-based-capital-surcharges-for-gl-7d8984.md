## Summary

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) is inviting public comment on a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the Board's rule that identifies and establishes risk-based capital surcharges for global systemically important bank holding companies (GSIBs). The proposal would also amend the Systemic Risk Report (FR Y- 15), which is the source of inputs to the implementation of the GSIB framework under the capital rule. The changes set forth in the proposal would improve the precision of the GSIB surcharge and better measure systemic risk under the framework. For certain systemic indicators currently measured only as of a single date, the proposal would change to reporting of the average of daily or monthly values to reduce the effects of temporary changes to indicator values around measurement dates. To improve risk capture, the proposal would also make improvements to the measurement of some systemic indicators used in the GSIB surcharge framework and the framework for determining prudential standards for large banking organizations. In addition, the proposal would reduce cliff effects and enhance the sensitivity of the surcharge to changes in the method 2 score by calculating surcharges based on narrower score band ranges. Finally, the proposal would make several amendments to the FR Y-15 to improve the consistency of data reporting and systemic indicator measurement.
