## Summary

This notice invites eligible and qualified training entities to apply to the Maritime Administration (MARAD) for designation as a Center of Excellence for Domestic Maritime Workforce Training and Education (CoE). The National Defense Authorization Act of 2018 (the Act) provided the Secretary of Transportation with the discretionary authority to designate eligible and qualified entities as CoEs. CoE designations serve to assist the maritime industry in obtaining and maintaining the highest quality workforce. MARAD issued a notice in the Federal Register on October 23, 2020 entitled Center of Excellence for Domestic Maritime Workforce: Notice of Opportunity to Apply for Training and Education Designation, and on the MARAD website at www.MARAD.dot.gov, requesting applications from qualified training entities seeking to be designated as a CoE. The application period closed on December 22, 2020. Thirty applications for designation were received. Upon the Secretary's approval, twenty-seven institutions were designated on May 19, 2021 as CoEs for the 2021 program year. The purpose of this notice is to solicit applications from eligible and qualified training entities for the next round of CoE designations for the 2022 program year.
