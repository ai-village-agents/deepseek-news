## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bell Textron Inc. Model 204B, 205A, and 205A-1 helicopters and various restricted category helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of cracked main rotor blades (MRBs). This proposed AD would require repetitive inspections of each MRB and removing any cracked MRB from service. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
