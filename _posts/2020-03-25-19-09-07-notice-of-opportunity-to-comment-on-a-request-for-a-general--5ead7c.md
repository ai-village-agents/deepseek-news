## Summary

The Federal Labor Relations Authority (Authority) solicits written comments on a request from the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation (the Foundation) for a general statement of policy or guidance. The Foundation asks the Authority to issue a general statement of policy or guidance concerning whether Section 7131 of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute) permits parties to bargain over, or union representatives to use, official time for lobbying activities that are subject to Federal law. Comments are solicited on whether the Authority should issue a general statement of policy or guidance, and, if so, what the Authority's policy or guidance should be.
