## Summary

DoD is withdrawing the proposed rule to amend the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) for the case titled: Export-Controlled Items (DFARS Case 2018-D053). The decision not to proceed with a final rule has been made because of a change in the associated policy requirements for certain contractors to provide export authorizations. Accordingly, this proposed rule is withdrawn, and the DFARS case is closed.
