## Summary

FMCSA announces that Navistar, Inc. (Navistar) has requested a 5-year exemption from the Federal requirement to hold a U.S. commercial driver's license (CDL) for Mr. Anders Bj[ouml]rkman, an engineer with Scania's Powertrain Control systems group in Sweden. Navistar and Scania are both subsidiaries of Germany's TRATON Group. Mr. Bj[ouml]rkman holds a valid Swedish commercial license and needs to test drive Navistar CMVs on U.S. roads to better understand product requirements in "real world" environments and to verify results.
