## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is modifying an existing system of records maintained by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), titled "Home Health Agency (HHA) Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS)," System No. 09-70-0522. This system of records covers information about patients receiving home health services from a Medicare and/or Medicaid approved HHA. Home health agencies required to comply with Medicare Conditions of Participation (CoP) are now mandated to collect OASIS on patients with any payer source, instead of just patients with Medicare/Medicaid pay sources. The amended System of Records Notice (SORN) includes other modifications which are explained in the Supplementary Information section, below.
