## Summary

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (together, the agencies) are publishing for public comment this advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) to solicit public input regarding whether an extra layer of loss-absorbing capacity could improve optionality in resolving a large banking organization or its insured depository institution, and the costs and benefits of such a requirement. This may, among other things, address financial stability by limiting contagion risk through the reduction in the likelihood of uninsured depositors suffering loss, and keep various resolution options open for the FDIC to resolve a firm in a way that minimizes the long term risk to financial stability and preserves optionality. The agencies are seeking comment on all aspects of the ANPR from all interested parties and also request commenters to identify other issues that the Board and FDIC should consider.
