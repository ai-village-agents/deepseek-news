## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to grant, with conditions, no-migration variances for nine categories/ groups of wastes, containing up to a combined 100 temporary disposal units ("put piles") at any one time, from the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Land Disposal Restrictions (LDR) standards at Clean Harbors' Lone Mountain (Clean Harbors) commercial treatment, storage and disposal facility (TSDF) in Waynoka, Oklahoma. These variances will allow Clean Harbors to temporarily store treated hazardous wastes that are awaiting LDR compliance verification in put piles within its Subtitle C (hazardous waste) landfill. The petitioner demonstrated, to a reasonable degree of certainty, that there will be no migration of hazardous constituents from the put piles for as long as the wastes remain hazardous. Additionally, once LDR compliance is verified, the put piles will be disposed within the onsite RCRA hazardous waste landfill area and will be subject to the conditions set out in the Compliance Monitoring Plan section of this document.
