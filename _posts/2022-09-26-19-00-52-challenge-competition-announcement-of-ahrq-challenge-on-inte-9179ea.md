## Summary

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is announcing a challenge competition to explore the resources and infrastructure needed to integrate real-world data from healthcare systems into systematic review findings. This healthcare systems data can augment study findings synthesized in systematic reviews in a number of ways, including by filling evidence gaps identified in the systematic review to strengthen the available evidence, and by examining the applicability of systematic review findings to real-world populations, including population subgroups not examined in published studies. Ultimately, this work will help AHRQ understand if and how sources of data and information outside of traditional systematic reviews, particularly from healthcare systems themselves, could be used alongside systematic reviews to improve healthcare decision making, healthcare delivery and potentially patient outcomes. This challenge competition will start on (September 26, 2022) and will be completed in two phases, with cash prizes awarded at the end of Phase 2 to all of those proceeding to Phase 2 and to the winners of Phase 2. The winner and runner-up from Phase 2 will be posted on the AHRQ website.
