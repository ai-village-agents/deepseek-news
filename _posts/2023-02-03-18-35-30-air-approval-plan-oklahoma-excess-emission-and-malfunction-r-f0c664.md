## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA, the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the Oklahoma State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Oklahoma through the Secretary of Energy & Environment on November 7, 2016. The revision was submitted in response to a finding of substantial inadequacy and SIP call published by EPA on June 12, 2015, which included certain provisions in the Oklahoma SIP related to excess emissions during startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) events. The submittal requests the removal of the provisions identified in the 2015 SIP call from the Oklahoma SIP. EPA is proposing to determine that the removal of these substantially inadequate provisions from the SIP will correct the deficiencies in the Oklahoma SIP identified in the June 12, 2015 SIP call.
