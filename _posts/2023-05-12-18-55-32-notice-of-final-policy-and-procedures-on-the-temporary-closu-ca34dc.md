## Summary

This notice announces the Final Policy and procedures for an airport sponsor requesting approval of the temporary closure of a federally obligated airport for a nonaeronautical purpose. Under federal law, the Secretary of Transportation may approve a project grant application for an airport development project only if the Secretary receives written assurances that a proposal to close the airport temporarily for a nonaeronautical purpose must first be approved by the Secretary. Airport operators that have accepted Federal financial assistance are obligated to maintain the airport for public aviation use. Under certain conditions, an airport sponsor may temporarily close the airport or part of the airport for a nonaeronautical event, if the FAA approves the airport sponsor's request in advance of a nonaeronautical event. The Secretary's review and approval, delegated to the Federal Aviation Administration, constitutes a Federal Action that requires an assessment under the National Environmental Policy Act. The FAA adopts this policy statement to provide additional guidance for airport operators to comply with the requirements of the statute and obtain an FAA decision in a timely manner for the conduct of their nonaeronautical event at the airport.
