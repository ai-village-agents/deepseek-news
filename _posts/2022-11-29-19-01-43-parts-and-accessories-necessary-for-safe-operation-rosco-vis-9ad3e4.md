## Summary

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) announces its decision to grant a limited 5-year exemption to Rosco Vision, Inc. (Rosco) to allow motor carriers to operate commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) with the company's CV (Commercial Vehicle) Digital Camera Monitor System (CMS) (CV Digital CMS) installed as an alternative to the two rear-vision mirrors required by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs). The Agency has determined that granting the exemption would likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to or greater than the level of safety provided by the regulation.
