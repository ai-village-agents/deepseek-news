## Summary

This notice announces a virtual public meeting of the Medicare Evidence Development & Coverage Advisory Committee (MEDCAC) ("Committee") will be held on Tuesday, May 21, 2024. The MEDCAC panel will consider which health outcomes in studies of devices for self- management of Type 1 and insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes should be of interest to CMS. Given the increased emphasis on new and innovative medical products for difficult to manage conditions, some studies of new medical technologies have focused on short-term data with greater reliance on intermediate outcomes and surrogate endpoints. As a result, assessments of new medical technologies have more frequent evidence gaps with respect to clinically meaningful health outcomes for CMS beneficiaries. The MEDCAC panel will examine the growing challenges associated with the decreased level of evidence of certain new and innovative technologies. By voting on specific questions, and by their discussions, MEDCAC panel members will advise CMS about the ideal health outcomes in research studies of devices for diabetes self-management, appropriate measurement instruments and adequate follow-up durations to help to provide clarity and transparency in future National Coverage Analyses (NCAs). This meeting is open to the public in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App. 2, section 10(a)).
