## Summary

This document contains an Interpretive Bulletin (IB) setting forth guidelines for determining when a qualified public accountant is independent for purposes of auditing and rendering an opinion on the financial statements required to be included in the annual report filed with the Department of Labor (Department) under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). Under ERISA, a plan administrator is generally required to retain, on behalf of all plan participants, an "independent qualified public accountant" to conduct an annual examination of the plan's financial statements and to render an opinion as to whether the financial statements are presented fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and whether the schedules required to be included in the plan's annual report present fairly, and in all material respects the information contained therein when considered in conjunction with the financial statements taken as a whole. The purpose of this document is to revise and restate an IB the Department issued in 1975 on accountant independence in order to remove certain outdated and unnecessarily restrictive provisions and reorganize its provisions for clarity while continuing to ensure that the Department's interpretations foster proper auditor independence and access of employee benefit plan to highly qualified auditors and audit firms.
