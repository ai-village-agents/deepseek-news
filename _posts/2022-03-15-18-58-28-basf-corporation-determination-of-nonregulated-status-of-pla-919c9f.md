## Summary

We are advising the public of our determination that soybean designated as event GMB151, which has been developed using genetic engineering for resistance to the plant-parasitic nematode, soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines), and for tolerance to 4- hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD-4) inhibitor herbicides, is no longer considered regulated. Our determination is based on our evaluation of data submitted by BASF Corporation in its petition for a determination of nonregulated status, our analysis of available scientific data, and public comments received in response to our previous notices announcing the availability of the petition for nonregulated status and its associated draft environmental assessment and draft plant pest risk assessment. This notice also announces the availability of our final environmental assessment, final plant pest risk assessment, written determination, and finding of no significant impact.
