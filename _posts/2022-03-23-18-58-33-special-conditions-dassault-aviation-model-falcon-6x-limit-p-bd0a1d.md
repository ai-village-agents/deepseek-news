This airplane is equipped with an electronic flight-control system that includes pilot controls through a side stick instead of through a conventional wheel or control stick. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
