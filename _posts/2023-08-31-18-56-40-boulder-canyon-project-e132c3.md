# Boulder Canyon Project

## Summary

The Deputy Secretary confirms, approves, and places into effect on a final basis the Boulder Canyon Project base charge and rates for fiscal year 2024 under Rate Schedule BCP-F11. The base charge increased 11.3 percent from $66.8 million in FY 2023 to $74.3 million in FY 2024. The change is primarily the result of an increase in the Bureau of Reclamation's (Reclamation) replacement costs, an increase in WAPA's operations and maintenance (O&M) expenses and replacement costs, and a decrease in prior year carryover funds from FY 2023.
