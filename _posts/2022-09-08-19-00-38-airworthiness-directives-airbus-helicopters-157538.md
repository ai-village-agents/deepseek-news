## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model AS332C, AS332C1, AS332L, and AS332L1 helicopters. This AD was prompted by review of maintenance instructions that showed conflicting methods of recording torque cycles for certain parts. This AD requires recalculating the torque cycles of certain parts and updating log cards; removing certain other parts from service; and applying an operational restriction on certain parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also requires incorporating the re-calculated life limits into existing maintenance records. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
