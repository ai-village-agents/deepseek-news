## Summary

Under this re-established matching program, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will disclose return information, relating to unearned income, to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), for the Disclosure of Information to Federal, State and Local Agencies (DIFSLA). The purpose of this matching program is to make available to VBA certain return information needed to determine eligibility for, and amount of benefits for, VBA applicants and beneficiaries of needs-based benefits, and to adjust income-dependent benefit payments, as prescribed by law. Currently, the most cost-effective and efficient way to verify the annual income of applicants and recipients of these benefits is through a computer match.
