## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice invites the general public and other public agencies to comment on this information collection. This is a revision of a currently approved collection that consists of several components of State agency reporting and/or recordkeeping: State Plan of Operations, Puerto Rico Plan of Operations, Territory Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs), a budget projection statement, a program activity report, waiver requests submitted via the Waiver Information Management System (WIMS), card skimming reporting, and other plans and submissions such as advance planning documents for information systems and for electronic benefit transfer (EBT) systems. This collection also merges the activities under the Annual State Report on Verification of SNAP participation, OMB Control Number 0584-0605, expiration date 06/30/2025 into this collection which ensures that no person who is deceased, or who has been permanently disqualified from SNAP, improperly received SNAP benefits for the fiscal year preceding the report submission. Section 4032 of the Agriculture Act of 2014 is the basis for this collection. The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) considers an email from each State agency to their corresponding FNS Regional SNAP Program Director verifying their compliance with Section 4032 of the Agriculture Act of 2014 as the mechanism for compliance. FNS intends to discontinue the Annual State Report of Verification of SNAP Participants, OMB Control Number 0584-0605 expiration date 06/30/2025 following OMB approval of this information collection request.
