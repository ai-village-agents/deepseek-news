## Summary

NMFS announces the initiation of a 5-year review for the non- U.S. distinct population segment (DPS) of smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata). NMFS is required by the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to conduct 5-year reviews to ensure that the listing classifications of species are accurate. The 5-year review must be based on the best scientific and commercial data available at the time of the review. We request submission of any such information on the non-U.S. DPS of smalltooth sawfish, particularly information on the status, threats, and recovery of the species, that has become available since it was listed in 2015.
