## Summary

In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), this notice announces that the Information Collection Request (ICR) abstracted below will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected burden. This document describes a new collection of information for which NHTSA intends to seek OMB approval. The Survey on Driver Awareness of Motorcycles is a one-time voluntary survey regarding motorists' knowledge, attitudes, and awareness of safe-driving behaviors towards motorcycles. A Federal Register notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting public comments on the following information collection was published on April 7, 2022. NHTSA received seven comments. The National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies submitted a letter of support for the proposed information collection, as did two individuals. The other four comments were either neutral, implicitly supportive, or not directly relevant to the proposed information collection, as described below.
