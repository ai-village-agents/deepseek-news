## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain ATR--GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42-500 and ATR72-212A airplanes. This AD was prompted by a finding that dispatch with a failed main hydraulic pump under the provisions of a certain master minimum equipment list (MMEL) item, combined with failure of the DC EMER BUS, could lead to failure of multiple system losses. This AD requires revising the existing minimum equipment list (MEL) to incorporate new provisions to ensure appropriate actions are taken when the airplane is dispatched with one inoperative main hydraulic pump. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
