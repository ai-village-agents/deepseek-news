## Summary

This rule adopts as final, without change, interim amendments to title 8 and title 19 of the Code of Federal Regulations published in the Federal Register on December 28, 2021, that require commercial vessel operators to electronically submit the data elements of Form I- 418 to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in lieu of submitting a paper form. This electronic submission streamlines vessel arrival and departure processes by eliminating redundant data submissions, simplifying vessel inspections, and automating recordkeeping.
