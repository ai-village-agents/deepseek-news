## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is proposing two Clean Air Act (CAA) actions related to the attainment date for the Uinta Basin (Basin), Utah Marginal nonattainment area under the 2015 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). First, the Agency is proposing to grant a second 1-year extension of the attainment date for the area. This action would extend the Marginal area attainment date for this area from August 3, 2022, to August 3, 2023. Second, the Agency is proposing to determine that the area attained the standard by the extended attainment date of August 3, 2023, based on certified ozone monitoring data from 2020-2022. This action, if finalized, will fulfill the EPA's statutory obligation to determine whether the Uinta Basin Marginal ozone nonattainment area attained the NAAQS by the attainment date through publication in the Federal Register.
