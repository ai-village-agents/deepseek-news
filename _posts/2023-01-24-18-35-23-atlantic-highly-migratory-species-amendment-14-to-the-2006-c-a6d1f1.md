## Summary

NMFS announces the approval of Amendment 14 to the 2006 Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species (HMS) Fishery Management Plan (FMP). Amendment 14 revises the mechanism or "framework" used in establishing quotas and related management measures for Atlantic shark fisheries. The revised framework will modify the procedures followed in establishing the acceptable biological catch (ABC) and annual catch limits (ACLs) for Atlantic sharks and the process used to account for carryover or underharvests of quotas. It will also allow the option to phase-in ABC control rules and to adopt multi-year overfishing status determination criteria in some circumstances. Amendment 14 does not make changes to the current quotas or other management measures. Any operational changes to fishery management measures as a result of Amendment 14 would be considered in future rulemakings, as appropriate.
