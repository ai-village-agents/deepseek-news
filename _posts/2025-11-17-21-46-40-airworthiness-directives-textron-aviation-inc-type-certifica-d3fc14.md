## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Textron Aviation Inc. Model 182Q and 182R airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of damaged intercooler inlet and outlet hoses. This AD requires repetitive visual inspections of the intercooler inlet and outlet hoses for cracks and, at a certain compliance time or if any cracks are found, replacement of the intercooler inlet and outlet hoses. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
