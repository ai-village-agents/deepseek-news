## Summary

The Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, is initiating the Land Management Plan (Plan) revision process, pursuant to the 2012 Planning Rule and as directed by the National Forest Management Act, for the Lolo National Forest located in western Montana. This process will result in a revised Land Management Plan which will guide all resource management activities on the Lolo National Forest for approximately 15 years. This notice announces the initiation of the assessment phase, the beginning of plan development, and the preliminary stages of the plan revision process. The assessment will identify and consider relevant and readily accessible material about ecological, social, and economic conditions and trends in the planning area, including best available scientific information. Trends and conditions identified in the assessment will then help describe a need to change the existing plan and inform the revision of the Plan.
