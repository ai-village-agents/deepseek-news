## Summary

In this action, the EPA is proposing new and revised standards of performance for electric arc furnaces (EAF) and argon-oxygen decarburization (AOD) vessels in the steel industry. The EPA is proposing that EAF facilities that begin construction, reconstruction or modification after May 16, 2022 would need to comply with a particulate matter (PM) standard in the format of facility-wide PM emitted per amount of steel produced and a melt shop opacity limit of zero. The proposal would limit emissions of PM and opacity from new, modified, or reconstructed EAF and AOD vessels. In addition, we are proposing that all emission limits apply at all times; periodic compliance testing at least once every 5 years; and electronic reporting. In this action, the EPA also is proposing amendments for certain provisions in the current new source performance standards (NSPS) that apply to EAF constructed after October 21, 1974, and on or before August 17, 1983, and EAF and AOD vessels constructed after August 17, 1983, and before May 16, 2022 to clarify and refine the current provisions.
