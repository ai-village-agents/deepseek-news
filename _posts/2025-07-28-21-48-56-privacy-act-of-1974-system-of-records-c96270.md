## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (as amended), the Department of the Army is modifying and reissuing a current system of records titled, "Army Family Advocacy Program Files," A0608-18 DASG. The system of records name is changing from "Army Family Advocacy Program Files" to "Army Family Advocacy Program Records." This system of records was originally established to maintain records that identify, monitor, track and provide treatment to alleged offenders, eligible victims and their families of substantiated spouse/child abuse, and neglect. The system is being updated to expand coverage to intimate partners of service members and the intimate partner's children as it pertains to allegations of domestic abuse and child abuse/neglect. Additionally, Army is updating the routine use section to add the DoD standard routine uses (routine uses A through J). The Army is also modifying various other sections within the system of records notice (SORN) to improve clarity or update information that has changed.
