## Summary

The U.S. Department of Labor publishes this final rule to modify procedures and standards the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs ("OFCCP" or "the agency") uses when issuing pre-enforcement notices and securing compliance through conciliation. This final rule strengthens OFCCP's enforcement by rescinding the evidentiary standards and definitions codified in 2020 ("the 2020 rule"), which hindered the agency's ability to pursue meritorious cases. OFCCP is instituting a streamlined, effective, and flexible pre- enforcement and conciliation process that promotes greater consistency with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VII").
