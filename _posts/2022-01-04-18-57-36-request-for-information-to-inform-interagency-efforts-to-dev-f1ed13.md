## Summary

The Department of the Interior (Department), on behalf of an interagency working group co-led with the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), Department of Agriculture (USDA), and Department of Commerce (DOC) through National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), is soliciting comments to inform how the American Conservation and Stewardship Atlas (Atlas) can best serve as a useful tool for the public and how it should reflect a continuum of conservation actions in the America the Beautiful initiative, recognizing that many uses of lands and waters can be consistent with the long-term health of natural systems and contribute to addressing climate change and environmental injustices. The input received will be used to develop the Atlas.
