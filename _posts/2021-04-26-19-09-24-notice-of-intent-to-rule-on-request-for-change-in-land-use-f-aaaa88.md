## Summary

Notice is being given that the FAA is considering a request from the Town of Pittsfield, MA to change 16.2 acres of land from aeronautical to non-aeronautical use for non-aeronautical revenue generation at Pittsfield Municipal Airport, Pittsfield, MA. The airport has two projects. The fire project is the installation of a solar farm and the second is a municipal water tank that will service the airport. The solar facility will be built on three on airport sites, totaling 15.5 acres, and will produce 6 mW of energy. The power produced will go into the electrical grid, however, the airport will have a long term land lease with the solar utility, generating a long term revenue stream for the airport. The lease revenue will be placed in the airport's operating and maintenance fund. The municipal water tank will serve the community as well as the airport, significantly enhancing the existing airport water system and serve future development on the airport as well. The tank and access road requires approximately .73 acres and will not interfere with future development of the airport.
