## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A318, A319, A320, and A321 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by unclear and incomplete placard instructions for the doghouse door lock. This AD requires installing improved handling instruction placards on affected doghouses and re-identifying the doghouses, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also prohibits the installation of affected doghouses under certain conditions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
