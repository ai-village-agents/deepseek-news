## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500-1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of multiple in-service failures of engine feed check valves, which have resulted in fuel imbalance conditions in flight. This AD requires repetitive replacement of the left-and right-side engine feed check valves with new engine feed check valves and prohibits flight dispatch under certain conditions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
