## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is requesting public comment on the minimum property requirements (MPRs) for VA-guaranteed and direct loans. VA will consider information received in response to this advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) in implementing the Improving Access to the VA Home Loan Benefit Act of 2022 (the Act). The Act requires VA to consider making changes to MPRs in prescribing updated regulatory requirements regarding appraisals. This ANPRM seeks public input to better understand areas for improvement in MPRs, including whether VA should consider adopting an approach that aligns with other industry-wide property standards already in existence.
