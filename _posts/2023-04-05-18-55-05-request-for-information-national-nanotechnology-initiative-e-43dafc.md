## Summary

The National Nanotechnology Coordination Office (NNCO), on behalf of the Nanoscale Science, Engineering, and Technology (NSET) Subcommittee of the Committee on Technology, National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), seeks public input in updating the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) Research Strategy. The NNI's current strategy was prepared in 2011, with substantial public engagement. Federal agencies participating in NSET's Nanotechnology Environmental and Health Implications (NEHI) Working Group have begun to review the 2011 NNI EHS Research Strategy and request input to help inform a revised and updated EHS strategy.
