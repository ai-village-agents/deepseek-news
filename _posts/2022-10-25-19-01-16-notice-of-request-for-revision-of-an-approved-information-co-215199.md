## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations, the FSIS is announcing its intention to request a revision of the approved information for an exploratory Web-based survey of consumers to evaluate food safety education and communication activities and to inform the development of food safety communication products. The revision is requested because the survey content has been modified to collect additional information on consumer awareness and understanding of Safe Handling Instructions and the USDA mark of inspection, food safety knowledge, food safety risk perceptions, preferences for receiving food safety information from FSIS, and perceptions of USDA. The approval for this information collection will expire on October 31, 2023.
