## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of an uncommanded change to the mode control panel (MCP) selected altitude. This proposed AD would require replacing the existing MCP with an updated MCP and performing an installation test. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
