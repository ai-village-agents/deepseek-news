## Summary

These special conditions are issued for the Airbus Defense and Space (Airbus DS) C-295 series airplane. This airplane will have novel or unusual design features when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport category airplanes. This design feature is airplane electronic systems and networks that allow access from external sources (e.g., wireless devices, internet connectivity) to the airplane's previously isolated, internal electronic components. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
