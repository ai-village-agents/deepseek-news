## Summary

GSA, in furtherance of its authority to furnish space to federal agencies, hereby amends the Federal Management Regulation (FMR) to elaborate on the factors that are advantageous to the Government when planning for location decisions. In addition, the proposed revisions are necessary to bring the current regulation into compliance with updated terminology in statute and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) bulletins. The objective of these changes is to direct agencies to better integrate strategic, holistic analysis into planning for agency location decisions and to provide consistency in the application of these regulations across Federal agencies and regions.
