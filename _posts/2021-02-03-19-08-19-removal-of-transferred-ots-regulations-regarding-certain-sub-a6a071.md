## Summary

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is adopting a final rule to rescind and remove rules from the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) regulations titled Subordinate Organizations that were transferred to the FDIC from the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) on July 21, 2011, in connection with the implementation of Title III of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) regarding subordinate organizations of State savings associations because the FDIC has determined that the requirements for State savings association subordinate organizations included therein are substantially similar to the requirements for State savings associations and their subsidiaries set forth by certain sections of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) and its implementing regulations.
