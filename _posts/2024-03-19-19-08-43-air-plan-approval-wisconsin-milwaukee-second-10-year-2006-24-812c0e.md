## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve, under the Clean Air Act (CAA), the limited maintenance plan (LMP) submitted on April 8, 2022, by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) for the Milwaukee-Racine maintenance area including Milwaukee, Waukesha, and Racine counties. The plan addresses the second 10-year maintenance period for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 2.5 micrometers (PM<INF>2.5</INF>). EPA is proposing to approve Wisconsin's LMP submission for Milwaukee-Racine because it provides for the maintenance of the 2006 PM<INF>2.5</INF> national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) through the end of the second 10-year portion of the maintenance period. In addition, EPA is initiating the process to find the Milwaukee-Racine PM<INF>2.5</INF> LMP adequate for transportation conformity purposes.
