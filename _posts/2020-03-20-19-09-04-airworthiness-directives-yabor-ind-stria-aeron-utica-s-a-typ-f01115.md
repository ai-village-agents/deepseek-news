## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Yabor[atilde] Ind[uacute]stria Aeron[aacute]utica S.A. (Type Certificate Previously Held by Embraer S.A.) Model ERJ 170 airplanes and Model ERJ 190-100 STD, -100 LR, -100 ECJ, -100 IGW, -200 STD, -200 LR, and -200 IGW airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of cracks discovered on the engine pylon inboard lower link lugs. This proposed AD would require repetitive detailed inspections of the engine inboard and outboard engine pylon lower link lugs for cracking, and repair if necessary, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) Brazilian AD, which will be incorporated by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
