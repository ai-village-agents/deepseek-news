## Summary

The U.S. Army Installation Management Command (IMCOM) has completed a Programmatic Environmental Assessment (PEA) analyzing the impacts of developing, adopting, implementing, and updating Real Property Management Plans (RPMPs) and their component documents using a standardized process in accordance with Department of Defense (DoD) and Army guidance, and encouraging community partner participation in this process. The Army is making the PEA and a draft Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) available for public comment. The PEA identifies no significant environmental impacts from implementing the Proposed Action. The draft FONSI concludes that preparing an environmental impact statement is not required and, therefore, one will not be prepared.
