## Summary

Since Fiscal Year (FY) 2014, the Jobs Plus Pilot initiative program (commonly known as Jobs Plus or "JP") has provided competitive grants to partnerships between public housing authorities (PHAs), local workforce investment boards established under section 117 of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, and other agencies and organizations that provide support to help public housing residents obtain employment and increase earnings. On March 29, 2018, HUD published a Federal Register notice announcing waivers and alternative requirements for Jobs Plus. This notice establishes a new rent incentive structure in accordance with the Housing Opportunity Through Modernization Act of 2016 (HOTMA) (approved July 29, 2016), for FY 2025 and future Jobs Plus grants. This notice also states that Jobs Plus grants awarded for FY2023-2024 and prior FYs are subject to 24 CFR 960.255(e)(2) and must continue to implement the Jobs Plus rent incentive in accordance with the Jobs Plus Earned Income Disregard (JPEID) structure.
