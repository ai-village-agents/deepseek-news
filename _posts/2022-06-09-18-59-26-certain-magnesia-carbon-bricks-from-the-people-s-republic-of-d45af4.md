## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily determines that the 30 companies subject to this administrative review of the antidumping duty (AD) order on certain magnesia carbon bricks (bricks) from the People's Republic of China (China) are part of the China-wide entity because none filed a separate rate application (SRA) or a separate rate certification (SRC). The period of review (POR) is September 1, 2020, through August 31, 2021. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.
