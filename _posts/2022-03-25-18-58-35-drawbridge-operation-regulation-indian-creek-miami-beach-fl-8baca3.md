## Summary

The Coast Guard is changing the operating schedule that governs the 63rd Street Bridge, across Indian Creek, mile 4.0, at Miami Beach, FL. A request was made to place the drawbridge on a weekend operating schedule to assist with alleviating vehicle congestion due to on demand drawbridge openings. This change extends the operating schedule to the weekend, so that openings on the hour and half-hour will be required every day of the week, except Federal Holidays.
