## Summary

FMCSA announces that Motion Picture Compliance Solutions (MPCS) has applied for an exemption on behalf of its members that employ commercial driver's license (CDL) holders subject to drug and alcohol testing. Specifically, MPCS requests an exemption from the requirement that an employer must not employ a driver who is subject to drug and alcohol testing to perform safety-sensitive functions prior to conducting a full query of the Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse (Clearinghouse). Under the requested exemption, MPCS would conduct a limited query of the Clearinghouse before one of its member employers hires a driver for a project. If the limited query indicates that information about the driver exists in the Clearinghouse, the driver would not be permitted to perform safety-sensitive functions unless and until a full query subsequently shows that the driver is not prohibited from operating a commercial motor vehicle (CMV). FMCSA requests public comment on MPCS's application for an exemption.
