## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has granted the request of Constellation Energy Generation, LLC, to withdraw its application dated August 2, 2021, as supplemented by letter dated June 6, 2022, for proposed amendments to Renewed Facility Operating License Nos. NPF-72 and NPF-77, issued to the licensee for operation of the Braidwood Station, Units 1 and 2, located in Will County, Illinois. The proposed amendments would have revised Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.9, "Ultimate Heat Sink [UHS]" for an inoperable UHS due to the average water temperature to allow utilization of existing margin in the design analysis to offset the increase in the TS UHS temperature. The proposed amendments also would have revised TS 3.7.9 Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.7.9.2 to delete the temporary allowance for the UHS average water temperature of 102.8 degrees Fahrenheit ([deg]F) until September 30, 2021.
