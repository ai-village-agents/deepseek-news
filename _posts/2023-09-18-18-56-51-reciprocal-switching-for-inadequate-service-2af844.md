# Reciprocal Switching for Inadequate Service

## Summary

This decision proposes, in a new subdocket, a new set of regulations that would provide for the prescription of reciprocal switching agreements to address inadequate rail service, as determined using objective standards based on a carrier's original estimated time of arrival, transit time, and first-mile and last-mile service. To help implement the new regulations, the Surface Transportation Board (Board or STB) proposes to require Class I carriers to submit certain data, which would be publicly accessible and generalized; and to adopt a new requirement that, upon written request by a customer, a rail carrier must provide to that customer individualized, machine-readable service data.
