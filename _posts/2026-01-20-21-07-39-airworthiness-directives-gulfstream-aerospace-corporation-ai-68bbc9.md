## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation Model GVI airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that new and more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new and more restrictive airworthiness limitations. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
