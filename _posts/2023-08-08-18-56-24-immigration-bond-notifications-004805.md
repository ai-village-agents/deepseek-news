## Summary

DHS is revising its regulations governing service of bond notifications. Current regulations authorize ICE to serve documents in- person, or by certified, registered, or first-class (regular) mail. This IFR authorizes ICE to electronically serve bond-related notifications to obligors for immigration bonds. The ICE transition to electronic notifications for bond-related documents is part of an electronic bonds system ICE developed to simplify the posting of bonds.
