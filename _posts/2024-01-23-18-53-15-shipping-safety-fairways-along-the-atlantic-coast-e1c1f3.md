## Summary

The Coast Guard, as the lead agency, announces its intent to prepare a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement that will evaluate the potential environmental consequences of the Coast Guard's Proposed Action to establish shipping safety fairways and other routing measures along the Atlantic Coast of the United States. While vessels are not required to use them, fairways are designed to keep traditional navigation routes free from fixed structures that could impact navigation safety and impede other shared offshore activities. This Notice of Intent is intended to solicit feedback on preliminary alternatives to help the Coast Guard narrow the scope of the PEIS. The Coast Guard intends to host three in-person meetings and one virtual scoping public meeting to provide additional information to the public and to solicit input on potential issues, concerns, and reasonable alternatives that should be considered in the PEIS.
