## Summary

The President's 2026 Budget requested no new funding for the Denali Commission in 2026 and proposed to use all available resources to conduct an orderly closeout of the Commission. Congress has begun work on bills that do provide funding for the Commission's FY 2026 operations and the FY 2026 Work Plan represents the Commission's contingency plan if such a bill is enacted. The Denali Commission (Commission) is an independent Federal agency based on an innovative federal-state partnership designed to provide critical utilities, infrastructure and support for economic development and training in Alaska by delivering federal services in the most cost-effective manner possible. The Commission is required to develop an annual work plan for future spending which will be published in the Federal Register, providing an opportunity for a 30-day period of public review and written comment. This Federal Register notice serves to announce the 30-day opportunity for public comment on the Denali Commission Draft Work Plan for Federal Fiscal Year 2026 (FY 2026).
