## Summary

We, the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (hereafter, "Access Board" or "Board"), are issuing this direct final rule to extend, for three years, the sunset provisions in the Board's existing accessibility standards for medical diagnostic equipment related to the low-height specifications for transfer surfaces to provide additional time for research necessary to determine the appropriate, final specification for the low transfer height position. The Access Board is issuing these amendments directly as a final rule because we believe they are noncontroversial, unlikely to receive adverse comment, and will serve the public interest.
