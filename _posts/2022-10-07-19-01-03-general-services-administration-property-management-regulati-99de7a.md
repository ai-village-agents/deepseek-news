## Summary

The General Service Administration (GSA) is proposing to amend GSA's regulations under the Privacy Act. The revisions would clarify and update the language of procedural requirements pertaining to the inclusion of Social Security account numbers (SSNs) on documents that GSA sends by mail. These revisions are necessary to implement the Social Security Number Fraud Prevention Act of 2017, which restricts the inclusion of Social Security account Numbers (SSNs) on documents sent by mail by the Federal Government.
