## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain GE Aviation Czech s.r.o. (GEAC) M601E-11, M601E-11A, M601E- 11AS, M601E-11S, and M601F model turboprop engines. This AD was prompted by the exclusion of life limits for certain compressor cases and compressor drums from the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the engine maintenance manual (EMM). This AD was also prompted by certain compressor cases that, following rework, were improperly re- identified and the engine logbook entries were not completed. This AD requires recalculation of the consumed life for the affected compressor cases and compressor drums and, depending on the results of the recalculation, removal and replacement of the affected compressor case or compressor drum with a part eligible for installation. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
