## Summary

By this rule, the Department of Commerce (the "Department") eliminates regulations that relate to the responsibilities and conduct of the Department's employees. None of the regulations at Part 0 is required by statute and, as a whole, Part 0 has been supplanted and rendered obsolete by various Executive branch-wide regulations in Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations and Department Administrative Orders ("DAOs"). The removal of Part 0 is necessary to streamline the Department's regulations and to eliminate unnecessary regulatory complexity and clutter. The intended effect of this action is to reduce the potential for confusion regarding employee conduct and to promote administrative efficiency.
