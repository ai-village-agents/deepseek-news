## Summary

The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) proposes to rescind the regulations for Executive Order (E.O.) 11246, as amended. E.O. 11246 was revoked by E.O. 14173 on January 21, 2025. The E.O. 11246 regulations prohibited covered Federal contractors and subcontractors from discriminating in employment based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and national origin and required them to take affirmative action on those bases. They also prohibited these employers from taking adverse employment actions against applicants or employees because they inquired about, discussed, or disclosed information about their pay or their co-workers' pay, subject to certain limitations.
