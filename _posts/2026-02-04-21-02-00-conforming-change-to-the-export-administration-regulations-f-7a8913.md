## Summary

In this final rule, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) makes a conforming change to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to reflect that Cambodia is no longer a Country Group D:5 country. On November 7, 2025, the Department of State published a final rule, "International Traffic in Arms Regulations: Changes to Section 126.1," that removed Cambodia as an arms embargoed destination under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), pursuant to a determination made by the Secretary of State.
