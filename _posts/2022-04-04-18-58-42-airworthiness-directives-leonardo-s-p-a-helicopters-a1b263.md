## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-23- 07, which applied to certain Leonardo S.p.a. Model AB139 and AW139 helicopters. AD 2020-23-07 required removing certain life raft reservoirs (reservoirs) from service, inspecting the reservoirs and actuator cables, and depending on the inspection results, replacing the reservoir or adjusting the actuator cable. This AD was prompted by the inadvertent activation and deployment of an emergency life raft while the helicopter was in flight. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2020-23-07, and requires expanding the required actions to include additional serial-numbered reservoirs, and updates applicable service information. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
