## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of corrosion on one or more of the eight lower fitting assemblies and adjacent lavatory components on certain lavatories. This AD requires a detailed inspection of the lower fitting assemblies and the centerline partition threshold of the lavatories for corrosion, recording on the modification record placard, and applicable on-condition actions. This AD also requires revising the existing maintenance program to incorporate a detailed inspection of the lavatory vertical side forward fittings for corrosion or damage. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
