# Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that during regular pre-flight checks multiple door assist handles failed by pulling loose from their lower attachment point in the doorway support bracket. This proposed AD would require, depending on airplane configuration, doing an inspection of the forward and aft door assist handles for correct installation, installing a new retainer above the lower keyway of the support bracket assembly at certain locations, installing a placard on certain support bracket assemblies, reidentifying the support bracket assembly, and replacing the upper spring clip. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
