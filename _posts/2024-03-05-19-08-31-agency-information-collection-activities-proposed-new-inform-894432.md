## Summary

The FDIC, as part of its obligations under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), invites the general public and other Federal agencies to take this opportunity to comment on the Visitor Notification form, which the FDIC intends to use to collect biographical, passport (for foreign nationals), and employment information from certain visitors to the FDIC in order to assess the risk to FDIC facilities and personnel. The FDIC will require certain visitors to FDIC facilities to complete and submit the form. FDIC is seeking a new OMB Control Number for this information collection.
