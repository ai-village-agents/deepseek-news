# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Helicopters Model AS350B2, AS350B3, and EC130B4 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of broken cargo swing frames and the determination to change an existing repetitive inspection threshold. This proposed AD would require repetitively inspecting the cargo swing installation and frame and, depending on the results, corrective action, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
