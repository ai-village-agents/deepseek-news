## Summary

In this document, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (Bureau) of the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) extends the enforcement of the technical standard transition period for hearing aid compatibility by six months from June 5, 2023 to December 5, 2023. We take this step to ensure that handset manufacturers can continue to release the newest handset models capable of achieving hearing aid compatibility while we consider a pending waiver request filed by ATIS addressing the volume control requirements of the newest hearing aid compatibility technical standard.
