## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announces the vessel sanitation inspection fees instituted in fiscal year (FY) 2025 will continue in FY 2026 and remain in place until further notice or a modification is published. These inspections are conducted by HHS/CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program (VSP). VSP helps the cruise line industry fulfill its responsibility for developing and implementing comprehensive sanitation programs to minimize the risk for environmentally associated illnesses and hazards. Every vessel that has a foreign itinerary and carries 13 or more passengers is subject to twice-yearly unannounced operations inspections and, when necessary, reinspection.
