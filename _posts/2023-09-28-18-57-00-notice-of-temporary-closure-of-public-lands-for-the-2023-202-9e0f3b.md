## Summary

The Las Vegas Field Office announces the temporary closures of certain public lands under its administration for three annual off- highway vehicle (OHV) races that occur in Laughlin, Nevada. This area is used by OHV recreationists, and the temporary closures are needed to limit their access to the race area and to minimize the risk of potential collisions with spectators and racers.
