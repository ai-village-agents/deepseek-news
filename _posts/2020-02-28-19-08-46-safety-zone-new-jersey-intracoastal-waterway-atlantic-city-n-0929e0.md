## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for certain navigable waters of the New Jersey Intracoastal Waterway. The safety zone is needed to protect participants of the Stockton University-AC Double Duel Regatta on these navigable waters near Atlantic City, NJ, during the rowing competition on April 4, 2020, and April 5, 2020. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit non- participant persons and vessels from entering, transiting through, anchoring in, or remaining within the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port (COTP) Delaware Bay or a designated representative. We invite your comments on the proposed rulemaking.
