## Summary

The Board is instituting a proceeding to determine the railroad industry's cost of capital for 2021. The decision solicits comments on the following issues: The railroads' 2021 current cost of debt capital; the railroads' 2021 current cost of preferred equity capital (if any); the railroads' 2021 cost of common equity capital; the 2021 capital structure mix of the railroad industry on a market value basis; and the appropriate treatment of Kansas City Southern (KCS) in light of the merger transaction currently under consideration in Canadian Pacific Railway--Control--Kansas City Southern, Docket No. FD 36500. For example, there is not a full year of KCS stock price data available for 2021.
