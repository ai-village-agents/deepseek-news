## Summary

In accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), the OCC, the Board, and the FDIC (the agencies) may not conduct or sponsor, and the respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), of which the agencies are members, has approved the agencies' publication for public comment of a proposal to extend for three years, with revision, the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Report) (FFIEC 031, FFIEC 041, and FFIEC 051), the Regulatory Capital Reporting for Institutions Subject to the Advanced Capital Adequacy Framework (FFIEC 101), and the Market Risk Regulatory Report for Institutions Subject to the Market Risk Capital Rule (FFIEC 102), which are currently approved collections of information for each agency. The agencies are requesting comment on proposed revisions to these collections related to the agencies' regulatory capital rule proposal that was published on September 18, 2023 (proposed capital rule). The reporting revisions are proposed to be effective as of the September 30, 2025, report date. At the end of the comment period for this notice, the FFIEC and the agencies will review any comments received to determine whether to modify the proposal in response to such comments. As required by the PRA, the agencies will then publish a second Federal Register notice for a 30-day comment period and submit the final Call Report, FFIEC 101 and FFIEC 102 to OMB for review and approval.
