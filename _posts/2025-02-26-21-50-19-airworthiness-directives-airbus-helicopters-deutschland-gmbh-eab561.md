## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH Model MBB-BK 117 C-2 and MBB-BK 117 D-2 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of significant wear of the control rod assembly and pitch link assembly spherical bearings. This proposed AD would require measuring the radial play of certain control rod assembly and pitch link assembly spherical bearings, reporting the results, and depending on the results, taking corrective action. These actions are specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. This proposed AD would also prohibit installing certain control rod assemblies and pitch link assemblies unless certain requirements are met. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
