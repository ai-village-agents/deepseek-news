## Summary

On October 12, 2022, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a proposed rulemaking to revise the Federal Air Rules for Reservations (FARR), a collection of Federal Implementation Plans (FIPs) under the Clean Air Act for Indian reservations in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. In the preamble of that publication, the description of the proposed changes to one of the rules in the FARR, the general open burning rule, was inadvertently replaced with a duplicate of the description of the proposed changes to a different rule. We are publishing this document to supply the correct preamble description of the proposed changes to the general open burning rule to the public. We note that there are no corrections to the proposed amendments to the rule language.
