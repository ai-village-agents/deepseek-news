## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of loss of control of an outboard aileron surface due to hydraulic fluid contaminating an electronic card of the flight control remote module (FCRM). This AD requires replacing any affected elevator FCRM and prohibits installing aileron or spoiler FCRMs in place of elevator or rudder FCRMs. This AD also limits the installation of FCRMs under certain conditions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
