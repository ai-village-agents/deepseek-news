## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to deny the exemption application from SBL Truck Driving Academy, Inc. (SBL). SBL sought an exemption from the theory and behind-the-wheel (BTW) instructor requirements contained in the entry-level driver training (ELDT) regulations for two of its instructors. SBL specifically requested an exemption from the requirement that instructors have at least two years of experience driving a commercial motor vehicle (CMV) requiring a commercial driver's license (CDL) of the same or higher class and/or the same endorsement level for which training is to be provided. FMCSA analyzed the exemption application and public comments and determined that the application lacked evidence that would ensure an equivalent or greater level of safety than would be achieved absent such exemption.
