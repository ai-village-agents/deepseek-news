## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to modify the operating regulation that governs the Lehigh Valley Drawbridge across Newark Bay, mile 4.6, between the City of Newark and City of Bayonne, NJ. This proposed change in the regulation will not alter the operating schedule of the bridge but will allow the bridge to be remotely operated from the Conrail North Jersey Dispatch Center in Mount Laurel, NJ. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
