## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") amends its test procedure for consumer boilers established under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. This rulemaking fulfills DOE's obligation to review its test procedures for covered products at least once every seven years. The revisions include: incorporating by reference the latest versions of the industry standards currently referenced in the Federal test procedure; relocating the test procedure to a new appendix separate from the residential furnace test procedure; removing an extraneous definition from its regulatory definitions; and making clarifying corrections to calculations. These revisions will improve the representativeness of the test method and will not be unduly burdensome to conduct.
