## Summary

Rural Development (RD), a mission area within the Department of Agriculture consisting of RHS, RBCS, and RUS, is in the process of reviewing all regulations within its purview to reduce regulatory burdens and costs. Pursuant to this review, RD has identified the provisions in 7 CFR part 1930 as obsolete, unnecessary, and outdated due to lack of substantive material. RD is removing these provisions to streamline and clarify the dictates of title 7.
