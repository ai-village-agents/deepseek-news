## Summary

In this notice, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) requests input from the public to help inform the development of the Federal Evidence Agenda on LGBTQI+ Equity. Executive Order 14075 on Advancing Equality for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex Individuals (June 15, 2022) required the co-chairs of the Interagency Working Group on Equitable Data to establish a subcommittee on sexual orientation, gender identity, and variations in sex characteristics (SOGI) data. That body, now part of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Subcommittee on Equitable Data, is tasked with the development and release of a Federal Evidence Agenda on LGBTQI+ Equity, which will improve the Federal government's ability to make data-informed policy decisions that advance equity for the LGBTQI+ community.
