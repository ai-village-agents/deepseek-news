## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) and accompanying environmental assessment (EA) for a requested exemption from certain NRC requirements regarding the Controlled Area Boundary (CAB) for the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) located in San Diego County, California. Based on the analysis in the EA, the NRC staff has concluded that there will be no significant impacts to environmental resources from the requested exemption and, therefore, a FONSI is appropriate.
