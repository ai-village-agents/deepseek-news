## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency is approving an application from the state of Louisiana to revise the state's Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) section 1422 underground injection control (UIC) program to include Class VI injection well primary enforcement responsibility (primacy). This final rule allows the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources to issue UIC permits for geologic carbon sequestration facilities as Class VI wells and ensure compliance of Class VI wells under the UIC program within the state. The EPA will remain the permitting authority for all well classes in Indian lands within the state and will also oversee Louisiana's administration of the state's UIC Class VI program as authorized under SDWA.
