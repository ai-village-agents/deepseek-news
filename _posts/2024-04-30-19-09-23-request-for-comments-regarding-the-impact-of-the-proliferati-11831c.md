## Summary

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO or Office) seeks public comments regarding the impact of the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) on prior art, the knowledge of a person having ordinary skill in the art (PHOSITA), and determinations of patentability made in view of the foregoing. The increasing power and deployment of AI has the potential to provide tremendous societal and economic benefits and foster a new wave of innovation and creativity while also posing novel challenges and opportunities for intellectual property (IP) policy. Through the AI and Emerging Technologies Partnership (AI/ET Partnership), the USPTO has been actively engaging with the innovation community and AI experts on IP policy in view of AI. To build on these efforts, the USPTO is requesting written public comments on how the proliferation of AI could affect certain evaluations made by the Office, including what qualifies as prior art, the assessment of the level of skill of a PHOSITA, and determinations of patentability made in view of these evaluations. The USPTO expects that the responses received will help the Office evaluate the need for further guidance on these matters, aid in the development of any such guidance, and help inform the USPTO's work in the courts and in providing technical advice to Congress.
