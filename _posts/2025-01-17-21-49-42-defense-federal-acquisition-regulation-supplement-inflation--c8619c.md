## Summary

DoD is proposing to amend the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to further implement the statute that requires an adjustment every 5 years of statutory acquisition-related thresholds for inflation. The adjustment uses the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers and does not apply to the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute (Davis-Bacon Act), Service Contract Labor Standards statute, performance and payment bonds, and trade agreements thresholds. DoD is also proposing to use the same methodology to adjust some nonstatutory DFARS acquisition-related thresholds in 2025.
