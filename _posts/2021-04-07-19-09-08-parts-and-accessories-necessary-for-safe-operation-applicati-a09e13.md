## Summary

FMCSA requests public comment on an application for exemption from Loomis Armored US, LLC to allow the driver and passenger doors of the cab of its specialized armored vehicles to be welded shut. Loomis believes that welding shut the cab doors and adding two new doors behind the cab will maintain a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level of safety achieved without the exemption, while allowing secure armored car operations with reduced staff.
