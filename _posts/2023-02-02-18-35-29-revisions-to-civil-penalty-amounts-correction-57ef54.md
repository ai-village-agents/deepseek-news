## Summary

In accordance with the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015, DOT published a final rule on January 6, 2023, to provide the 2023 inflation adjustment to civil penalty amounts that may be imposed for violations of certain DOT regulations. This rule corrects errors in that rulemaking by making the statutorily required adjustment to an unadjusted FAA penalty and updating a table heading.
