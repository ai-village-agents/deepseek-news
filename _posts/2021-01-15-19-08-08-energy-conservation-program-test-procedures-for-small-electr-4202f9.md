## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") recently published a final rule amending the test procedures for small electric motors and electric motors. This correction republishes an amendment from that final rule that could not be incorporated into the Code of Federal Regulations ("CFR") due to an inaccurate amendatory instruction. Neither the error nor the correction in this document affect the substance of the rulemaking or any conclusions reached in support of the final rule.
