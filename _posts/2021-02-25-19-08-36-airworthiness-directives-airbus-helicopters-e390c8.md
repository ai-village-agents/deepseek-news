## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Airbus Helicopters Model AS350B3 helicopters. This AD requires modifying the electrical system of the throttle twist grip, inspecting the routing of a microswitch electrical harness, and correcting the electrical harness routing if it is incorrect. This AD was prompted by reports of the engine remaining in idle when the twist grip was turned from the "forced idle" position to the "flight" position. The actions of this AD are intended to address an unsafe condition on these products.
