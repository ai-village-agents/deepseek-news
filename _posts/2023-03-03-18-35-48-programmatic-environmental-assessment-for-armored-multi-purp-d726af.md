## Summary

The Department of the Army (Army) has completed a Programmatic Environmental Assessment (PEA) analyzing the impacts of fielding the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) at various Army installations in accordance with Department of Defense (DoD) and Army guidance. The Army is making the PEA and a draft Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) available for public comment. The PEA identifies no significant environmental impacts from implementing the proposed action. The draft FONSI concludes that preparing an environmental impact statement is not required and, therefore, one will not be prepared.
