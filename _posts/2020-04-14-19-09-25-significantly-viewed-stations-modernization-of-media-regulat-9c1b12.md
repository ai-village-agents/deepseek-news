# Significantly Viewed Stations; Modernization of Media Regulation Initiative

## Summary

In this document, the Commission seeks comment on modernizing its methodology for determining whether a television broadcast station is "significantly viewed" in a community outside of its local television market and therefore may be treated as a local station in that community, permitted under the Commission's rules to be carried by cable systems and satellite operators. An examination into whether the existing methodology has become outdated or overly burdensome, particularly for smaller entities, is warranted given changes in the marketplace in the nearly fifty years since its adoption.
