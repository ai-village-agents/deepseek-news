## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-08-19, which applies to all The Boeing Company Model 787-8, -9, and -10 airplanes. AD 2021-08-19 requires repetitive general visual inspections for disengaged or damaged decompression panels of the bilge barriers located in the forward and aft cargo compartments, reinstallation of disengaged but undamaged panels, and replacement of damaged panels. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-08-19, new procedures for changing or replacing the bilge barrier assembly in the forward cargo compartment have been developed. This proposed AD would retain the requirements of AD 2021-08-19 and require changing or replacing the bilge barrier assembly in the forward and aft cargo compartments, which would terminate the repetitive inspections. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
