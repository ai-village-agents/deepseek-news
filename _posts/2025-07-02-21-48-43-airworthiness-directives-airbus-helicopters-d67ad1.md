# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model EC 155B and EC155B1 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that the required forces to jettison the windows exceed the maximum jettisoning effort requirements and the development of a modification of the jettisonable windows. This proposed AD would require replacement of the jettisonable windows and seals on the sliding doors and fixed panels on the left-hand and right- hand sides. This proposed AD would also require the installation of new labels. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
