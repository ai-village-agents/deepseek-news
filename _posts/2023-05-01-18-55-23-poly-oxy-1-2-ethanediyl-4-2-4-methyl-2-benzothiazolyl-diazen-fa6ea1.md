## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of poly (oxy-1,2-ethanediyl), [alpha],[alpha]'-[[[4-[2-(4-methyl-2- benzothiazolyl)diazenyl]phenyl]imino]di-2,1-ethanediyl]bis[[omega]- hydroxy- (CAS Reg. No. 158172-12-4), herein referred to as polymeric red, when used as an inert ingredient (colorant) on growing crops and raw agricultural commodities pre- and post-harvest. Milliken Chemical submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of polymeric red, when used in accordance with the terms of the exemption.
