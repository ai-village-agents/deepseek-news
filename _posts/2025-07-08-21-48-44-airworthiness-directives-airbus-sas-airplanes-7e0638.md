## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2024-25-06, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A318-series airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, -133, - 151N, -153N, and -171N airplanes; Model A320-series airplanes; and Model A321-series airplanes. AD 2024-25-06 requires repetitive inspection of the main landing gear (MLG) doors, and, depending on findings, accomplishment of applicable corrective actions, and prohibits the installation of affected parts. The FAA has determined that replacing the MLG door is necessary to address the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2024-25-06 and would require replacing affected parts with serviceable parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
