## Summary

This document announces that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is reducing Hungary's Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) travel authorization validity period for travel by citizens or nationals of Hungary under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) to the United States from two years from the date of issuance to one year and also limiting the validity of an ESTA for citizens or nationals of Hungary to a single use for ESTA applications received after the date of publication of this document. DHS is making these changes based on the Government of Hungary's inability to satisfy a number of VWP requirements.
