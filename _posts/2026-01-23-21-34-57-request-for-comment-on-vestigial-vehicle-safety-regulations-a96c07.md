## Summary

In alignment with the Department's ongoing commitment to regulatory reform and the promotion of automotive innovation, NHTSA is seeking public comment to identify requirements and test procedures within the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) and regulations that no longer serve a functional safety purpose but continue to impose costs, stifle design creativity, or act as barriers to the deployment of new technologies. This request for comment specifically targets technical requirements that hinder the transition to technology-neutral, performance-based standards.
