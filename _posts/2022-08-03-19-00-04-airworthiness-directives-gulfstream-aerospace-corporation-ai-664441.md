## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation (Gulfstream) Model GV and GV-SP airplanes. This AD was prompted by corrosion of the horizontal stabilizer lower bonded skin assemblies. This AD requires inspecting the horizontal stabilizer lower skin and associated bonded doublers and bonded stringers, repairing any area with corrosion beyond allowable damage limits, and incorporating revisions to the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) in the existing aircraft maintenance manual (AMM) or progressive maintenance program. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
