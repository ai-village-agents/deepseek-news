This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters during an annual high-speed boat race. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from entering the regulated area unless authorized by the Captain of the Port, Sector Virginia or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
