## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve revisions to the Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District (MDAQMD) and the Placer County Air Pollution Control District (PCAPCD) portions of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from metal coating operations and general regulatory definitions. We are also finalizing the rescission of South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) Rule 1107, Coating of Metal Parts and Products, as it applies to the Riverside County portion of the MDAQMD. We are approving these revisions, including local rules and a rescission, under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act).
