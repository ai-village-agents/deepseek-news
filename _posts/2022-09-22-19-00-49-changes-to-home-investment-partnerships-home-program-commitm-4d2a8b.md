## Summary

This final rule follows HUD's interim final rule published on December 2, 2016. The interim rule changed the method by which HUD determines participating jurisdictions' compliance with the statutory 24-month commitment requirements on the use of HOME Investment Partnerships program (HOME) funds, including the set-aside for community housing development organizations, under the Cranston- Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 (NAHA). Specifically, it implemented a grant-specific method for determining compliance with such requirements. In addition, the interim rule revised the method of administering program income to prevent participating jurisdictions from losing allocated HOME funds when they expend program income. This rule finalizes the December 2, 2016, interim rule without change.
