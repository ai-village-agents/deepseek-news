## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering whether to issue a construction permit (CP) to Abilene Christian University (ACU) to authorize the construction of a proposed non-power molten salt research reactor (MSRR). The MSRR would be an up to 1 megawatt-thermal, graphite moderated, fluoride salt flowing fluid (fuel dissolved in the salt) research reactor that would be located in the existing Gayle and Max Dillard Science and Engineering Research Center (SERC) building on the ACU campus in Abilene, Texas. The NRC has prepared this environmental assessment (EA) and finding of no significant impact (FONSI) that considers the impacts associated with issuing the CP.
