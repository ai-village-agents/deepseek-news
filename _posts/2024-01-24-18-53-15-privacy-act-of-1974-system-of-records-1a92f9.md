## Summary

The National Science Foundation (NSF) is establishing a new system of records, "Student Loan Repayment Program Case Files, NSF- 82," in connection with the recruitment of highly qualified job candidates and retention of highly qualified employees by paying off their Federally insured student loans. The agency will use this system to maintain and retrieve applications from individuals seeking such student loan repayment benefits, service agreements signed by individuals receiving such benefits, lender information, loan balances and repayment history, and other related program information and documentation for such individuals. Information in this system of records will be collected through various sources, including directly from the individual to whom the information applies, and from NSF officials, official NSF documents, student loan lenders or other agencies or third parties.
