## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled "Labeling of Plant-Based Alternatives to Animal-Derived Foods." This draft guidance, when finalized, will provide our recommendations on best practices for naming and labeling of certain plant-based foods that are marketed and sold as alternatives for animal-derived foods (plant-based alternative foods), especially in the absence of a common or usual name for the product. This draft guidance does not address the naming and labeling of plant-based milk alternatives; FDA is providing recommendations regarding these products in a separate guidance document.
