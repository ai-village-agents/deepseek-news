## Summary

The Commission hereby gives notice of the scheduling of full reviews pursuant to the Tariff Act of 1930 ("the Act") to determine whether revocation of the antidumping duty and countervailing duty orders on softwood lumber products from Canada would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury within a reasonably foreseeable time. The Commission has determined to exercise its authority to extend the review period by up to 90 days.
