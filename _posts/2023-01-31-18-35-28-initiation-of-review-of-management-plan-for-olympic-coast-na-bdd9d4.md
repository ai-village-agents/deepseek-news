## Summary

In accordance with section 304(e) of the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, as amended (NMSA), NOAA is initiating a review of the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary (OCNMS or sanctuary) management plan, to evaluate substantive progress toward implementing the goals of the sanctuary, and to make revisions to the management plan as necessary to fulfill the purposes and policies of the NMSA. NOAA anticipates management plan changes will require preparation of an environmental analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NOAA will conduct public scoping meetings to gather information and other comments from individuals, organizations, tribes, and government agencies on the scope, types, and significance of issues related to the OCNMS management plan and the proper scope of environmental analysis for the management plan review. The scoping meetings are scheduled as detailed in the DATES section.
