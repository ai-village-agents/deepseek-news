## Summary

The Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBCS or Agency), an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), invites applications under the Intermediary Relending Program (IRP) for fiscal year (FY) 2024, subject to availability of funding. This Notice is being issued prior to passage of a FY 2024 Consolidated Appropriations Act in order to allow applicants enough time to leverage financing, prepare and submit their applications, and give the Agency time to process program applications within FY 2024. Based on FY 2023 appropriated funding, the Agency estimates that approximately $18,889,000 will be available for FY 2024. Successful applications will be selected by the Agency for funding and subsequently awarded to the extent that funding may ultimately be made available through appropriations. The Agency advises that all interested parties bear the financial burden of preparing and submitting an application in response to this Notice whether or not funding is appropriated for this program in FY 2024.
