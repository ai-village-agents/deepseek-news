## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve revisions to the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (VCAPCD) portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from surface cleaning and degreasing operations, and from batch loaded vapor degreasing operations. We are approving changes to SIP- approved local rules to regulate these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act).
