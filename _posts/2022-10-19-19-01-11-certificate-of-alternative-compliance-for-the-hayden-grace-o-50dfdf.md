## Summary

The Coast Guard announces that the Chief of Prevention, Eighth Coast Guard District has issued a certificate of alternative compliance from the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), for the HAYDEN GRACE, O.N. 1326783. We are issuing this notice because its publication is required by statute. Due to the construction and placement of mast lights, stern light, and sidelights, HAYDEN GRACE cannot fully comply with the light, shape, or sound signal provisions of the 72 COLREGS without interfering with the vessel's design and construction. This notification of issuance of a certificate of alternative compliance promotes the Coast Guard's marine safety mission.
