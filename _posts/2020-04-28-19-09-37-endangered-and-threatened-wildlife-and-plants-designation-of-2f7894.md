## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are revising our proposed designation of critical habitat for the northern Mexican gartersnake (Thamnophis eques megalops) and narrow-headed gartersnake (Thamnophis rufipunctatus) under the Endangered Species Act, as amended (Act). In total, approximately 27,784 acres (11,244 hectares) in La Paz, Mohave, Yavapai, Gila, Cochise, Santa Cruz, and Pima Counties in Arizona, and in Grant County in New Mexico, fall within the boundaries of the revised proposed critical habitat designation for the northern Mexican gartersnake; and 18,701 acres (7,568 hectares) in Greenlee, Graham, Apache, Yavapai, Gila, and Coconino Counties in Arizona, as well as in Grant, Hidalgo, and Catron Counties in New Mexico, fall within the boundaries of the revised proposed critical habitat designation for the narrow-headed gartersnake. We also announce the availability of a draft economic analysis of the revised proposed designation of critical habitat for northern Mexican and narrow-headed gartersnakes. We request comments from all interested parties on this revised proposed rule and the associated draft economic analysis. Comments submitted on our July 10, 2013, proposed rule need not be resubmitted as they will be fully considered in the preparation of the final rule. If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would extend the Act's protections to these species' critical habitat.
