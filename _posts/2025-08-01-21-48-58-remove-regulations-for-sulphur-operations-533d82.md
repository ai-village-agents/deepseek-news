## Summary

The Department of the Interior (DOI or Department), through the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), is rescinding the majority of the provisions in its sulphur operations subpart and revising the subpart by applying other available regulatory requirements for similar operations to sulphur operations in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The existing regulations are outdated, duplicative of, or inconsistent with, other Department regulations. This direct final rule provides consistency and clarity to industry regarding regulatory requirements for sulphur operations by aligning the requirements with the Department's other BSEE-administered regulations.
