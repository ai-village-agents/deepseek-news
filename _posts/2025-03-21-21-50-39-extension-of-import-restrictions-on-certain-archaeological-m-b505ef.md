## Summary

This document amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regulations to extend import restrictions on certain archaeological material from the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. The Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States Department of State, has made the requisite determinations for extending the import restrictions, which were originally imposed by CBP Decision 20-02. These import restrictions are being extended pursuant to an exchange of diplomatic notes. The CBP regulations are being amended to reflect this further extension through January 14, 2030.
