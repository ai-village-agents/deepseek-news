## Summary

In accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is altering an existing department wide system of records, "Records About Restricted Dataset Requesters," System Number 09-90-1401, to add records maintained by HHS' Administration for Children and Families (ACF) and to make other changes, including changing the system of records name to "Records About Requesters of Restricted Datasets." This system of records covers records about individuals within and outside HHS who request restricted datasets and software products from HHS (e.g., for health-related scientific research and study purposes), when HHS maintains the requester records in a system from which they are retrieved directly by an individual requester's name or other personal identifier.
