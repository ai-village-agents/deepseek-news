## Summary

PHMSA is issuing technical amendments to regulations promulgated in its April 29, 2024, final rule titled "Periodic Updates of Regulatory References to Technical Standards and Miscellaneous Amendments." These technical amendments address the incorporation by reference of an updated edition of industry standard, ASME B31.8S, into specific provisions that the final rule did not update due to then- pending litigation. These technical amendments also respond to a Petition for Reconsideration filed on May 29, 2024.
