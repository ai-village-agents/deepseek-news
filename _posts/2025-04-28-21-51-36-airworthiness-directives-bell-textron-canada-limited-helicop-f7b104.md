## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bell Textron Canada Limited (BTCL) Model 505 helicopters. This AD was prompted by reports of possible chafing in certain locations between the basic and supplemental helicopter wiring and the structure. This AD requires repetitively inspecting the wire harnesses at certain locations for damage, and if any wire damage is found, repairing the damaged wire/bundles, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
