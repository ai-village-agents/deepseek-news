Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on February 14, 2020, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of Neodron Ltd. of Ireland. Letters supplementing the complaint were filed on February 19 and 21 and March 2, 2020. The complaint alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain capacitive touch-controlled mobile devices, computers, and components thereof by reason of infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 7,821,425 ("the '425 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 7,903,092 ("the '092 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 8,749,251 ("the '251 patent"); and U.S. Patent No. 9,411,472 ("the '472 patent"). The complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The complainant requests that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a limited exclusion order and cease and desist orders.
