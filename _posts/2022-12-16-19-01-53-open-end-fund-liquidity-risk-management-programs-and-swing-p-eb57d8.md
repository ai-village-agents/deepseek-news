## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") is proposing amendments to its current rules for open-end management investment companies ("open-end funds") regarding liquidity risk management programs and swing pricing. The proposed amendments are designed to improve liquidity risk management programs to better prepare funds for stressed conditions and improve transparency in liquidity classifications. The amendments are also designed to mitigate dilution of shareholders' interests in a fund by requiring any open-end fund, other than a money market fund or exchange-traded fund, to use swing pricing to adjust a fund's net asset value ("NAV") per share to pass on costs stemming from shareholder purchase or redemption activity to the shareholders engaged in that activity. In addition, to help operationalize the proposed swing pricing requirement, and to improve order processing more generally, the Commission is proposing a "hard close" requirement for these funds. Under this requirement, an order to purchase or redeem a fund's shares would be executed at the current day's price only if the fund, its designated transfer agent, or a registered securities clearing agency receives the order before the pricing time as of which the fund calculates its NAV. The Commission also is proposing amendments to reporting and disclosure requirements on Forms N-PORT, N-1A, and N-CEN that apply to certain registered investment companies, including registered open-end funds (other than money market funds), registered closed-end funds, and unit investment trusts. The proposed amendments would require more frequent reporting of monthly portfolio holdings and related information to the Commission and the public, amend certain reported identifiers, and make other amendments to require additional information about funds' liquidity risk management and use of swing pricing.
