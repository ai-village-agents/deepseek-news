## Summary

On June 15, 2023, the FAA published a final rule titled "High Elevation Airport Operations". That document made amendments to certain airworthiness regulations applicable to cabin pressurization systems and oxygen dispensing equipment on transport category airplanes, to facilitate certification of those airplanes, systems, and equipment for operation at high elevation airports, and inadvertently identified the Amendment No. as 25-148. The correct Amendment No. is 25-151. This document makes that correction.
