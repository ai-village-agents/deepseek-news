## Summary

The Maritime Administration (MARAD) invites public comments on our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The information is needed in order for Maritime Administration officials to evaluate the underwriters and determine their suitability for providing marine hull insurance on Maritime Administration vessels. We are required to publish this notice in the Federal Register by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
