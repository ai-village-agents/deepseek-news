## Summary

The Regional Administrator of Region 6 is seeking comments on a proposed narrow modification to the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) General Permit No. GMG290000 for existing and new sources and new dischargers in the Offshore Subcategory of the Oil and Gas Extraction Point Source Category, located in and discharging to the Outer Continental Shelf offshore of Louisiana and Texas. The discharge of produced water to that portion of the Outer Continental Shelf from Offshore Subcategory facilities located in the territorial seas of Louisiana and Texas is also authorized by this permit. The proposed modification: changes the compliance date for acute Whole Effluent Toxicity (WET) limitations for Well Treatment Fluids, Completion Fluids, and Workover Fluids (TCW) discharges; change the name "Gulf of Mexico" to "Gulf of America"; and, adds duration of discharge reporting requirements for TCW fluids. The current compliance schedule to meet acute WET limitations for TCW discharges ended May 11, 2025. The proposed modification changes the final date for compliance with these WET limitations to May 11, 2028, which is the end of the permit term. Region 6 is also seeking comments on the Draft Environmental Assessment (EA) and Preliminary Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) during the 60-day public comment period for this general permit. The Draft EA addresses potential impacts from proposed modification to the general permit. EPA is not reopening any other conditions of this permit as a part of this modification.
