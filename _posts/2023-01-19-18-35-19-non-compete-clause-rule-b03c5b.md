## Summary

Pursuant to Sections 5 and 6(g) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Federal Trade Commission ("Commission") is proposing the Non-Compete Clause Rule. The proposed rule would, among other things, provide that it is an unfair method of competition for an employer to enter into or attempt to enter into a non-compete clause with a worker; to maintain with a worker a non-compete clause; or, under certain circumstances, to represent to a worker that the worker is subject to a non-compete clause.
