## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a revision to the Imperial County Air Pollution Control District (ICAPCD) portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). This revision concerns emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) from new and replacement residential-type natural gas-fired water heaters. We are approving a local rule that regulates these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act).
