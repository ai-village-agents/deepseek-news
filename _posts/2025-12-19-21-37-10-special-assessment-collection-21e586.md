## Summary

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has been collecting a special assessment to recover losses arising from the protection of uninsured depositors under the systemic risk exception, as required by statute. To ensure that the FDIC recovers the correct amount of losses while minimizing the risk of overcollecting or undercollecting in aggregate, the FDIC is adopting this interim final rule to reduce the rate at which the special assessment will be collected in the eighth collection quarter from 3.36 basis points to 2.97 basis points, and provide an offset to regular quarterly deposit insurance assessments for banks subject to the special assessment if the amount collected exceeds losses following the resolution of litigation between the FDIC and SVB Financial Trust (SVBFT) and again following the termination of the receiverships.
