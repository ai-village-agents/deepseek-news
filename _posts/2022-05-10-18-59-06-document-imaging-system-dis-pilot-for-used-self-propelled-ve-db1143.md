## Summary

This document announces that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) plans to conduct a pilot to promote paperless processing of export documentation for used self-propelled vehicles (USPVs). Generally, USPVs include any vehicle that can be driven on land but not rail. The CBP regulations require a person attempting to export a USPV to present original vehicle ownership documentation to CBP at the port of exportation. In an effort to expedite and modernize the document submission and review process, CBP will be operating a voluntary pilot in which participants will submit the required vehicle ownership documentation to CBP electronically via the Document Imaging System (DIS). This voluntary pilot will evaluate the feasibility of using the DIS for the purpose of obtaining and reviewing vehicle ownership documentation for USPVs. This notice includes a description of the pilot, the eligibility requirements for participation, and invites public comment on any aspect of the pilot.
