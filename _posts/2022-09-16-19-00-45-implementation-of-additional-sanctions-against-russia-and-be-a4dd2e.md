## Summary

In response to the Russian Federation's (Russia's) ongoing aggression against Ukraine, the Department of Commerce is expanding the existing sanctions against Russia and Belarus by imposing new export controls, including expanding the scope of the Russian industry sector sanctions to add lower-level items potentially useful for Russia's chemical and biological weapons production capabilities and items needed for advanced production and development capabilities to enable advanced manufacturing across a number of industries. This rule also adds Belarus to the scope of industry sector sanctions that currently apply solely to Russia. With respect to end users, this rule expands the `military end user' and `military-intelligence end user' controls and applies the Russian/Belarusian-Military End User Foreign Direct Product (FDP) rule to ten existing entries for six existing entities that have continued to supply Russian entities on the Entity List or are under sanction since Russia's further invasion of Ukraine. Labeling these six entities as Russian `military end users' and applying the Russia/Belarus-Military End User FDP rule to them will degrade Russia's war efforts in Ukraine, as these entities produce items needed by the Russian and Belarussian military and industrial sectors. Correspondingly, this rule clarifies requirements related to Burma, Cambodia, the People's Republic of China, and Venezuela). Finally, this rule refines existing controls on Russia and Belarus by adding additional dollar value exclusion thresholds for `luxury goods;' and makes twelve corrections and clarifications to existing controls on Russia and Belarus. The Department of Commerce is taking these actions to clarify and enhance the effectiveness of U.S. controls and to better align its controls on both Russia and Belarus with those implemented by U.S. allies.
