## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish temporary safety zones for certain waters of Lake Erie, Cleveland Harbor, and the Cuyahoga River. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters near Cleveland, Ohio during the 2024 Pan-American Masters Games (Aquatic Sporting Events) from July 12 through July 15, 2024. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from entering these safety zones unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Sector Eastern Great Lakes or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
