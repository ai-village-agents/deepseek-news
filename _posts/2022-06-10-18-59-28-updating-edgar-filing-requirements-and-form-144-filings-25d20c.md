## Summary

We are adopting rule and form amendments that mandate the electronic filing or submission of documents that are currently permitted electronic submissions, including the "glossy" annual report to security holders, notices of exempt solicitations and exempt preliminary roll-up communications, notices of sales of securities of certain issuers, filings of required reports by foreign private issuers and filings made by multilateral development banks on our Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval ("EDGAR") system. We are also adopting rules that will mandate the electronic submission of the "glossy" annual report to security holders, the electronic filing of the certification made pursuant to the Exchange Act and its rules that a security has been approved by an exchange for listing and registration, the use of Inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language ("Inline XBRL") for the filing of the financial statements and accompanying notes to the financial statements required in the annual reports of employee stock purchase, savings and similar plans, and that will allow for the electronic submission of certain foreign language documents.
