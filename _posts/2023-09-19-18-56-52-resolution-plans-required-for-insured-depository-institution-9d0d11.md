## Summary

The FDIC is seeking comment on a proposal to revise its current rule that requires the submission of resolution plans by insured depository institutions (IDIs) with $50 billion or more in total assets. The proposal would modify the current rule by revising the requirements regarding the content and timing of resolution submissions as well as interim supplements to those submissions provided to the FDIC by IDIs with $50 billion or more in total assets in order to support the FDIC's resolution readiness in the event of material distress and failure of these large IDIs. IDIs with $100 billion or more in total assets will submit full resolution plans, while IDIs with total assets between $50 and $100 billion will submit informational filings. The proposed rule would also enhance how the credibility of resolution submissions will be assessed, expand expectations regarding engagement and capabilities testing, and explain expectations regarding the FDIC's review and enforcement of IDIs' compliance with the rule.
