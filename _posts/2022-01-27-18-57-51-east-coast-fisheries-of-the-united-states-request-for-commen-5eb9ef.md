## Summary

Several fishery management bodies on the East Coast of the U.S. are convening three public webinars to continue work on an initiative called East Coast Climate Change Scenario Planning. This is a joint effort of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC), the New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC), the Mid- Atlantic Fishery Management Council (MAFMC), the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC), and NOAA Fisheries. The focus of the webinars will be to explore the key drivers of change that could shape East Coast fisheries over the next 20 years. There will be opportunity for questions and engagement from the public as well as a brief update on this multi-year initiative.
