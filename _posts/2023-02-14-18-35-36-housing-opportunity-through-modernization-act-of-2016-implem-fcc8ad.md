## Summary

This final rule revises HUD regulations to implement parts of the Housing Opportunity Through Modernization Act of 2016 (HOTMA). In addition to amending regulations for HUD's public housing and Section 8 programs, this final rule revises the program regulations for several other HUD programs. HUD did this in the interest of aligning its requirements across its programs or because the underlying program statute required HUD to make the revisions. These include the regulations for HUD's Community Development Block Grants, HOME Investment Partnerships, Housing Trust Fund, Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS, Supportive Housing for the Elderly (Section 202), and Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities (Section 811) programs. Since HUD and other Federal agencies may use the regulations revised as part of this rulemaking in the calculation of income for other programs or activities, the public should be aware that the effects of this rulemaking are not limited to the programs listed in this rule and preamble.
