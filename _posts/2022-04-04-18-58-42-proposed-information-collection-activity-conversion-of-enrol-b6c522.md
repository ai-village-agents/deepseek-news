## Summary

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is proposing a new information collection using qualitative case studies to examine how and why Head Start grant recipients convert enrollment slots from Head Start to Early Head Start and the facilitators and barriers to the implementation of high-quality Early Head Start services following conversion. This information collection aims to present an internally valid description of the experiences of up to six purposively selected cases, not to promote statistical generalization to different sites or service populations.
