## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and 900ER series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that some passenger service unit (PSU)-mounted video monitors became detached from the PSU rails during a hard landing. This proposed AD would require replacing PSU-mounted video monitors that do not have secondary retention lanyards. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
