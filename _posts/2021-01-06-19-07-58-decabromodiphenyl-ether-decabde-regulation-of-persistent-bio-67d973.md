## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing a rule under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to address its obligations under TSCA for decabromodiphenyl ether (decaBDE) (CASRN 1163-19-5), which EPA has determined meets the requirements for expedited action under of TSCA. This final rule prohibits all manufacture (including import), processing, and distribution in commerce of decaBDE, or decaBDE-containing products or articles, with some exclusions. These requirements will result in lower amounts of decaBDE being manufactured, processed, distributed in commerce, used and disposed, thus reducing the exposures to humans and the environment.
