## Summary

The Federal Maritime Commission (Commission) is updating its current user fees and amending the relevant regulations to reflect these updates. The direct final rule would increase some fees to reflect increases in salaries of employees assigned to certain fee-generating services. For one service, the rule would lower fees because less-senior employees are assigned to the fee-generating activity. No substantive changes to the underlying regulations are included in this rulemaking; only changes to the user fee amounts.
