## Summary

NHTSA is initiating a rulemaking process to implement changes to the Highway Safety Grant Program (the annual formula grants to States) in accordance with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. In order to ensure that the broadest possible cross-section of stakeholders is engaged from the onset of the process, NHTSA is publishing this RFC and announcing three public meetings to be held prior to issuing the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM).
