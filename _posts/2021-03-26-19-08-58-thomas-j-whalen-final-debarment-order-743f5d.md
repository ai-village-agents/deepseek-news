## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) debarring Thomas J. Whalen for a period of 10 years from importing or offering for import any drug into the United States. FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Whalen was convicted of multiple offenses; two of these are relevant to this debarment: One count of importation contrary of law-aiding and abetting and one count of healthcare fraud-aiding and abetting. The factual basis supporting Mr. Whalen's conviction is conduct relating to the importation into the United States of a drug or controlled substance. Mr. Whalen was given notice of the proposed debarment and was given an opportunity to request a hearing to show why he should not be debarred. As of January 13, 2021 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Mr. Whalen had not responded. Mr. Whalen's failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this matter.
