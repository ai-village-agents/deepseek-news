## Summary

We are advising the public of our determination that MON 95379 Lepidopteran-Protected Maize (corn), which was developed using genetic engineering to produce two insecticidal proteins to protect against feeding damage caused by target lepidopteran pests, is no longer considered regulated. Our determination is based on our evaluation of information and data Bayer U.S.-Crop Science submitted in its petition for a determination of nonregulated status, available scientific data, the plant pest risk assessment, and public comments received in response to a previous notice announcing the availability of the petition for nonregulated status and a draft plant pest risk assessment. This notice announces the availability of our written determination and the availability of the final plant pest risk assessment.
