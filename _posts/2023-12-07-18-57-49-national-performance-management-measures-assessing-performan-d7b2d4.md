## Summary

This final rule amends FHWA's regulations governing national performance management measures and establishes a method for the measurement and reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with transportation (GHG measure). It requires State departments of transportation (State DOT) and metropolitan planning organizations (MPO) to establish declining carbon dioxide (CO<INF>2</INF>) targets for the GHG measure and report on progress toward the achievement of those targets. The rule does not mandate how low targets must be. Rather, State DOTs and MPOs have flexibility to set targets that are appropriate for their communities and that work for their respective climate change and other policy priorities, as long as the targets aim to reduce emissions over time. The FHWA will assess whether State DOTs have made significant progress toward achieving their targets.
