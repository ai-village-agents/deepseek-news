## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for an information collection. The collection involves Regulated Entity (RE) users that create and submit Compliance and Enforcement Action (CE) activity and Voluntary Disclosure Report (VDR) submittals to the FAA. The FAA enters and processes this activity and submittals using the Aviation Safety Knowledge Management Environment Compliance and Enforcement Actions (ASKME CEA) application. The information to be collected will be used to support processing CE and VDR processing for ASKME CEA application users andis necessary because it automates the process by which REs may disclose to the FAA potential occurrence of noncompliance to requirements.
