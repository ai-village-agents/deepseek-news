## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation Model S-92A helicopters. This AD was prompted by a cracked main rotor stationary swashplate assembly (swashplate assembly). This AD requires visually inspecting the swashplate assembly at specified intervals and depending on the results, removing the swashplate assembly from service. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
