## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-100-1A10 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that certain airplanes have navigation units with outdated magnetic variation (MagVar) tables. This proposed AD would require revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) and applicable corresponding operational procedures to update the flight management system (FMS) limitations. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
