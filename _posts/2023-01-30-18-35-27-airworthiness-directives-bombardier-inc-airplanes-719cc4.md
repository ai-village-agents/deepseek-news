## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-2B16 (604 Variant) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of oxygen leaks caused by cracked, brittle, or broken oxygen hoses that were found during scheduled maintenance tests of the airplane oxygen system. This proposed AD would require replacing oxygen system hoses having any part number in the O2C20T1 and O2C20T14 series. This AD also would prohibit installation of affected oxygen hoses. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
