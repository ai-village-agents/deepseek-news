## Summary

An open meeting of the Taxpayer Advocacy Panel's Toll-Free Phone Lines Project Committee will be conducted. The Taxpayer Advocacy Panel is soliciting public comments, ideas, and suggestions on improving customer service at the Internal Revenue Service. Due to a delay in the approval process and a late start with our initial meetings, we are getting a late start to the TAP year. Because of this we will not be able to meet the 15 calendar-day notice requirement. We anticipate all future Federal Register notices to be timely moving forward. This meeting will be held via teleconference.
