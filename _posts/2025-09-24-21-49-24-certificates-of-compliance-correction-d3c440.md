## Summary

On January 8, 2025, in consultation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission or CPSC) issued a final rule to revise the agency's regulation for Certificates of Compliance (certificates). The final rule contained two "effective dates" for products subject to the final rule based on how products were manufactured or imported into the United States. CPSC is making a technical correction to the DATES section of the final rule because the Office of the Federal Register requires one "effective date." The corrected final rule will contain one "effective date" for the final rule and two "applicability dates" based on how products are manufactured or imported into the United States. This technical correction has no substantive effect on the dates by which products subject to the final rule must be in compliance.
