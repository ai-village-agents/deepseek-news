## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is amending its regulations to implement new provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Fiscal Year (FY) 2021. The final rule provides new methods for small business government contractors to obtain past performance ratings to be used with offers on prime contracts with the Federal Government. A small business contractor may use a past performance rating for work performed as a member of a joint venture or for work performed as a first-tier subcontractor. This final rule updates the requirements for small business subcontracting plans to add a requirement for prime contractors to provide past performance to a first-tier, small business subcontractor when requested by the small business.
