## Summary

The Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) is announcing publication of a preliminary program bulletin titled "DCMWC Self-Insurance Process Guidelines" describing the agency's updated process for evaluating self-insurance applications under the Black Lung Benefits Act (BLBA). The BLBA requires coal mine operators to secure the payment of benefits by either purchasing commercial insurance or obtaining the Department's authorization to self-insure those liabilities. Authorization to self-insure may be granted or denied at the Department's discretion. OWCP is making the programmatic changes and preliminary bulletin available for public comment pursuant to the Department of Labor's PRO Good Guidance Rule.
