## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve Washington State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted on August 10, 2022. The submitted revisions incorporate the most recent updates to Washington's Smoke Management Plan and reflect state legislative and regulatory changes. The revisions include earlier notification of burn decisions, revise the burn approval criteria to better align with state law, remove the prohibition against summer weekend burning; and allow previously prohibited burning in urban growth areas subject to an approval process that requires consideration of the impact of the approval on air quality. EPA is proposing to approve the revisions based our determination that the revisions are consistent with Clean Air Act requirements.
