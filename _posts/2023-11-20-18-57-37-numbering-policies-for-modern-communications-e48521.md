## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) adopts rules regarding direct access to numbers by providers of interconnected Voice over internet Protocol (VoIP) services. The Commission takes this action in furtherance of Congress' directive in the Pallone-Thune Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence (TRACED) Act to examine ways to reduce access to telephone numbers by potential perpetrators of illegal robocalls. These actions safeguard U.S. numbering resources and consumers, protect national security interests, promote public safety, and reduce opportunities for regulatory arbitrage.
