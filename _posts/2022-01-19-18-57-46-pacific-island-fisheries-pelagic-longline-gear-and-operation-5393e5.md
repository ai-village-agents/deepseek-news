## Summary

NMFS proposes to prohibit the use of wire leaders in the Hawaii deep-set longline fishery, and require the removal of fishing gear from any oceanic whitetip shark caught in all of the region's domestic longline fisheries. The proposed action is intended to increase post-hooking survival of oceanic whitetip sharks.
