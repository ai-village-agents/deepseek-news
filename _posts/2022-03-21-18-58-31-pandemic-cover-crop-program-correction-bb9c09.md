## Summary

Due to inadvertently having not included valid cover cropping practices because of the timing of acreage reporting, the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) is correcting a final rule that published in the Federal Register on February 11, 2022. The final rule announced the Pandemic Cover Crop Program (PCCP) that provides support for agricultural producers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic for the 2022 crop year. With a specific focus on strengthening outreach to underserved producers and communities and small and medium agricultural operations, USDA dedicated funding to reaching a broader set of producers than was reached in previous COVID-19 assistance programs. As a part of that initiative, the final rule established PCCP for 2022.
