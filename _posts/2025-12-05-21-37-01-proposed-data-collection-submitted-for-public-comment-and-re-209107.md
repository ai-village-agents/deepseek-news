## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Fellowship Management System (FMS). The Fellowship Management System is an information technology platform through which CDC invites and manages applications to CDC fellowship programs from potential fellows and host sites. FMS also is used by some programs to monitor fellows' progress.
