## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), have received two enhancement of survival permit (permit) applications pursuant to the Endangered Species Act (ESA). If granted, the requested permits would authorize incidental take of the fisher, should the species become federally listed in the future under the ESA. The permit applications are associated with a template candidate conservation agreement with assurances (CCAA) previously developed by the Service for the conservation of the fisher. The conservation measures in the CCAA are intended to provide a net conservation benefit to the fisher. We have also prepared draft environmental action statements (EASs) pursuant to the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 for each of these permit applications. We are making the permit application packages and draft EASs available for public review and comment.
