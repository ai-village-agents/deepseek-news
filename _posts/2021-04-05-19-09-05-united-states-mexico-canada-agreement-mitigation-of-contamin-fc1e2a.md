## Summary

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the proposed United States- Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) Mitigation of Contaminated Transboundary Flows project (the Project). The USMCA Project involves the planning, design, and construction of infrastructure to reduce transboundary flows of untreated wastewater (sewage), trash, and sediment that routinely enter the U.S. from Mexico via the Tijuana River, its tributaries, and across the maritime boundary along the San Diego County coast. These transboundary flows impact public health and the environment and have been linked to beach closures along the San Diego County coast. EPA intends to evaluate project options located in the Tijuana River area in southern San Diego County, California in the U.S. and in the Tijuana region in Mexico. This notice initiates the scoping process by inviting comments from federal, state, and local agencies; Native American tribes; interested stakeholders; and the public to help identify the environmental issues and project options to be examined in the EIS. EPA is also providing notice of the public scoping meeting that is open to all interested parties.
