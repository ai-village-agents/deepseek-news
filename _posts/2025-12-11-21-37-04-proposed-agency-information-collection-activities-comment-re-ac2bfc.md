## Summary

In accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), the OCC, the Board, and the FDIC (the agencies) may not conduct or sponsor, and the respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. On July 10, 2025, the agencies, under the auspices of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), requested public comment for 60 days on a proposal to revise and extend for three years the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Report) (FFIEC 031, FFIEC 041, and FFIEC 051), which are currently approved collections of information (Call Report proposal). The revisions described in the Call Report proposal related to proposed revisions to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standards applicable to global systemically important bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries under the agencies' regulatory capital rules. The comment period for the Call Report proposal ended on September 8, 2025. As described in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION of this document, the agencies are proceeding with the proposed revisions to the FFIEC 031 report form and instructions, but with certain modifications. These revisions to reporting requirements would take effect as of the June 30, 2026, report date. The agencies are giving notice they are sending the collections to OMB for review.
