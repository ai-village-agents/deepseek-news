## Summary

The Department of Education proposes priorities, requirements, definitions, and selection criteria for CSP SE Grants, CMO Grants, and Developer Grants, Assistance Listing Numbers (ALNs) 84.282A, 84.282B, 84.282E, and 84.282M. We may use one or more of these priorities, requirements, definitions, and selection criteria for grant competitions under these programs in fiscal year (FY) 2022 and later years. We take this action to create results-driven policies to help promote positive student outcomes, student and staff diversity, educator and community empowerment, promising practices, and accountability, including fiscal transparency and responsibility, in charter schools supported with CSP funds, which can serve as models for other charter schools.
