## Summary

The U.S. Department of Education (Department) is issuing this request for information (RFI) to receive specific feedback on necessary updates to the Accreditation Handbook. Similar to the update to the Accreditation Handbook undertaken in 2019, the Department seeks to improve this important handbook to communicate clear and concise information to users so that the process for the Department's recognition of an accrediting agency is transparent, efficient, and not unduly burdensome. This RFI may also inform the Department's potential reforms to the accreditation regulatory process and may be complimentary to the public comments already received under the Department's call for Public Feedback for the Development of Proposed Regulations and Establish Negotiated Rulemaking Committee published on April 4, 2025. Information relating to this RFI or the Accreditation Handbook may also be discussed at future Negotiated Rulemakings held by the Department over the next year.
