## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2024-01- 01, which applied to certain The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. AD 2024-01-01 required repetitive general visual inspections (GVIs) of the area under all lavatory washbasins for evidence of intermittent and active leaks at the faucet control module (FCM) and applicable on-condition actions. This AD was prompted by development of an FCM with an improved design that is not susceptible to leaking. This AD continues to require the actions of AD 2024-01-01 and requires replacement of the FCM as terminating action for the repetitive GVIs, a leak test, installation of moisture management devices, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
