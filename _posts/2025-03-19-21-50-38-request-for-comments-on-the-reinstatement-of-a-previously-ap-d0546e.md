## Summary

The Maritime Administration (MARAD) invites public comments on our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The proposed collection OMB 2133-0541 (United States Marine Highway Program) (the Program) will be used to evaluate and review applications being submitted for grant award consideration. The James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 made substantive changes to the Program, including eliminating the requirement for MARAD to designate projects before they are eligible to compete from grants. As a result, on August 28, 2023, MARAD discontinued this collection. The Maritime Administration intends to reinstate this collection to facilitate operation of the Program, which provides funding to develop, expand, or promote marine highway transportation or shipper use of marine highway transportation, this collection is being reinstated. We are required to publish this notice in the Federal Register to obtain comments from the public and affected agencies.
