## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of multiple nonconformances, including excessive gaps and pull-up, in the forward pressure bulkhead. This AD requires an internal and external detailed inspection (DET) of the forward pressure bulkhead (FPB) for any damage and performing applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
