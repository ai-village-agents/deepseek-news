## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to deny Flat Top Transport's request for an exemption from the hours-of-service (HOS) regulations. Flat Top Transport requested a four-month exemption for "immediate and emergency delivery of dry and bulk food grade products to locations that supply stores and distribution centers nationally." FMCSA analyzed the application and public comments and determined that the exemption would not achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent such exemption.
