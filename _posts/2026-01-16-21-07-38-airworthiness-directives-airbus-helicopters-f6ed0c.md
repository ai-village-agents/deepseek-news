## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2025-23- 52, which applied to all Airbus Helicopters Model EC130B4 and EC130T2 helicopters. AD 2025-23-52, required replacing the center shaft assembly with a serviceable center shaft assembly (either a shaft with another part number (P/N) or the same P/N with lower hours time-in- service (TIS)) and prohibited installing a center shaft assembly that is not a serviceable center shaft assembly on any helicopter. Since the FAA issued AD 2025-23-52, it was determined that for certain center shaft assemblies a repetitive inspection is adequate instead of replacement. This AD requires repetitively inspecting the center shaft assembly for cracks and replacing the center shaft assembly if it fails the inspection or exceeds a certain TIS. This AD also prohibits installing a center shaft assembly that is not a serviceable center shaft assembly on any helicopter. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
