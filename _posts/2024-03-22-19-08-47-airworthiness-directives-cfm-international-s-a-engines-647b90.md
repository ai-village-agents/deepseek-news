## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain CFM International, S.A. (CFM) Model CFM56-2, CFM56-3, CFM56-5, CFM56-5B, CFM56-5C, and CFM56-7B engines. This AD was prompted by a report of electrical arcing on certain life-limited critical parts. This AD requires replacing certain compressor discharge pressure (CDP) seals, high-pressure compressor (HPC) stage 3 disks, and high-pressure turbine (HPT) rear shafts. This AD also prohibits installation of certain CDP seals, HPC stage 3 disks, and HPT rear shafts on any engine, and prohibits installation of any engine with certain CDP seals, HPC stage 3 disks, and HPT rear shafts installed on any airplane. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
