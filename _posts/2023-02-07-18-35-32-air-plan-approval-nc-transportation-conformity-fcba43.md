The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of North Carolina, through the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), Division of Air Quality (DAQ) on September 24, 2021. The SIP revisions replace previously approved memoranda of agreement (MOAs) with thirteen updated MOAs outlining transportation conformity criteria and procedures related to interagency consultation, conflict resolution, public participation, and enforceability of certain transportation-related control and mitigation measures. EPA is proposing to determine that North Carolina's September 24, 2021, SIP revisions are consistent with the applicable provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act).
