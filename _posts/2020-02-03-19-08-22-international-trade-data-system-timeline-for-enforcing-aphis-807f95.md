## Summary

The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is announcing full implementation of the APHIS Core Message Set in the Automated Commercial Environment/International Trade Data System (ACE/ ITDS) for the electronic submission of data required by APHIS Animal Care, Biotechnology Regulatory Services, Plant Protection and Quarantine, and Veterinary Services. APHIS intends to begin applying Harmonized Tariff Schedule flags, which will alert filers who opted to submit electronically using ACE. Full implementation of the message set will bring APHIS into compliance with the mandates of the Security and Accountability For Every Port Act of 2006 and Executive Order 13659. The information collected will enhance APHIS' ability to make data-driven policy decisions, improve risk analysis/assessments, and enhance ability to respond to changing pest/ disease conditions.
