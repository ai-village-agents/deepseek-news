## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Lockheed Martin Corporation/Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company Model 382, 382B, 382E, 382F, and 382G airplanes, type certificated in any category; and Model C-130A, C-130B, C-130BL, C-130E, C-130H, C-130H-30, C-130J, C-130J-30, EC-130Q, HC-130H, KC-130H, NC-130B, NC-130, and WC- 130H airplanes, type certificated in the restricted or amateur category. This AD was prompted by a crack found on the web attachment flange of the center wing upper forward corner fitting. This AD requires an eddy current surface scan for cracks of the center wing upper and lower forward corner fittings and fasteners, a torque check of the left and right outer-wing-to-center-wing front-beam-web-joint- splice-angle fasteners, and repair, retorqueing, or replacement if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
