## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-07-13, which applies to certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-100- 1A10 airplanes. AD 2020-07-13 requires revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to provide the flightcrew with new warnings for "Autoflight" and "Engine Failure in Climb During ALTS CAP." Since the FAA issued AD 2020-07-13, the procedures were revised to ensure that all applicable altitude capture modes utilized and annunciated in the affected fleet are included and to more clearly denote these altitude capture modes. This proposed AD would require revising the existing AFM to provide the flightcrew with new warnings for "Autoflight" and "Engine Failure in Climb During (V) ALTS CAP or (V) ALTV CAP." The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
