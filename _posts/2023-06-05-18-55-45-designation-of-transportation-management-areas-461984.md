## Summary

On December 29, 2022, the United States Census Bureau published a notice in the Federal Register announcing the qualifying urban areas from the 2020 Census. The FTA and FHWA are announcing that all urbanized areas (UZA) with populations greater than 200,000, as determined by the 2020 Census, are hereby identified as Transportation Management Areas (TMA). The FTA and FHWA are taking this action in compliance with the agencies' authorizing statutes. This action supersedes the agencies' previous designations of TMAs made in the Federal Register.
