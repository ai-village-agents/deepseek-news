## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. (Bell) Model 214ST helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by the discovery of bolts with nonconforming external thread root radii. This proposed AD would require removing the affected bolts from service and would prohibit installing an affected bolt on any helicopter. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
