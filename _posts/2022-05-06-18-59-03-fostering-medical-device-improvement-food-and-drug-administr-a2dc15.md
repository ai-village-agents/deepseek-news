## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of the draft guidance entitled "Fostering Medical Device Improvement: FDA Activities and Engagement with the Voluntary Improvement Program." FDA is issuing this draft guidance to describe its policy regarding FDA's participation in the Voluntary Improvement Program (VIP). The VIP is a voluntary program facilitated through the Medical Device Innovation Consortium (MDIC) that evaluates the capability and performance of a medical device manufacturer's practices using third-party appraisals, and is intended to guide improvement to enhance the quality of devices. The VIP builds on the framework piloted through FDA's 2018 Case for Quality Voluntary Medical Device Manufacturing and Product Quality Pilot Program (CfQ Pilot Program) and incorporates some of the successes and learnings from the pilot. This draft guidance is not final nor is it in effect at this time.
