## Summary

This regulation extends time-limited tolerances for residues of kasugamycin in or on almond and almond, hulls as identified in this document. This action is in response to EPA's granting of an emergency exemption under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) authorizing use of this pesticide. In addition, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) requires EPA to establish a time- limited tolerance or exemption from the requirement for a tolerance for pesticide chemical residues in food that will result from the use of a pesticide under an emergency exemption granted by EPA. Further, EPA issued a final rule in the Federal Register of November 3, 2023, that extended time-limited tolerances for multiple chemicals on various commodities in response to EPA's granting of emergency exemptions. EPA inadvertently omitted the detailed instructions for the revision of the tolerances for kasugamycin. Therefore, EPA is issuing this final rule to rectify this omission.
