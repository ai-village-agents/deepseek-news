## Summary

As a result of the determinations by the Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that revocation of the countervailing duty (CVD) orders on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) resin from the People's Republic of China (China) and India would likely lead to continuation or recurrence of net countervailable subsidies and material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is publishing this notice of continuation of the CVD orders.
