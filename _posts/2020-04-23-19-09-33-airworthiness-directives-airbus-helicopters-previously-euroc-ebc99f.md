## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2008-24-04 for Eurocopter France (now Airbus Helicopters) Model AS355E, AS355F, AS355F1, AS355F2, and AS355N helicopters. AD 2008-24-04 required repetitively inspecting the lubricating pump and checking the magnetic chip detector plug (chip detector) and the main gearbox (MGB) oil-sight glass. This new AD retains the requirements of AD 2008-24-04 and allows the option of altering the MGB oil flow distribution as a terminating action for the inspections. This AD was prompted by an alteration developed by Airbus Helicopters of the MGB oil flow distribution that corrects the unsafe condition. The actions of this AD are intended to address an unsafe condition on these products.
