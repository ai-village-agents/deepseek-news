## Summary

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) is proposing to revise its regulations to establish a restricted area within the explosive arc of Six Mile Munitions Storage Area (MSA) on Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson (JBER). The United States Air Force--Pacific Air Command (USAF PACAF) requested establishment of a restricted area which would be located within the navigable waters of Knik Arm which are a part of the Six Mile MSA explosive arc. The proposed restricted area would extend from the shoreline to the outward limits of the arc. Establishment of the restricted area would prohibit all watercraft navigations and individuals from entering the explosive arc area of the Six Mile MSA at all times except for authorized vessels and individuals in support of military training and management activities. This restricted area is necessary to avoid inadvertent entry into the explosive arc during an inadvertent detonation, and exposure to hazardous noise and fragments from such a detonation.
