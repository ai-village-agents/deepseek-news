## Summary

The FAA proposes to amend two VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways, establish one RNAV T-route, and revoke one Low Altitude Reporting Point in the vicinity of Wausau, Wisconsin. This action is necessary due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Wausau, WI, VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) which provides navigational guidance to portions of the affected Air Traffic Service (ATS) routes. The Wausau VOR is being decommissioned as part of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (VOR MON) program.
