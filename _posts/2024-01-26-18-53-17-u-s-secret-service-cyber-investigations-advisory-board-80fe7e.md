## Summary

The United States Secret Service (USSS) has reestablished a "Cyber Investigations Advisory Board (CIAB)," a Federal Advisory Committee, in order to "prevent and disrupt criminal use of cyberspace," as directed in the 2018 Department of Homeland Security Cybersecurity Strategy (Pillar #3, Goal #4) and as identified by the Secretary of Homeland Security in 2021. This notice is not a solicitation for membership. The goal of CIAB is to provide the USSS with insights from industry, the public sector, academia, and non- profit organizations on emerging cybersecurity and cybercrime issues, and to provide outside strategic direction for the USSS investigative mission. The CIAB will serve a principal mechanism through which senior industry and other experts can engage, collaborate, and advise the USSS regarding cybersecurity and cybercrime issues.
