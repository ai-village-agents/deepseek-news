## Summary

The interagency Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC) invites interested persons to submit written comments to assist the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) in the preparation of its annual report to the Congress on China's compliance with the commitments made in connection with its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Due to the COVID-19 situation, the TPSC will foster public participation via written questions and written responses relating to the written comments received by the TPSC rather than an in-person hearing. This notice includes the schedule for submission of comments, questions and responses.
