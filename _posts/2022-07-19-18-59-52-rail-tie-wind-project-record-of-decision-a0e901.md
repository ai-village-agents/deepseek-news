## Summary

ConnectGen Albany County LLC (ConnectGen) filed two interconnection requests with the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) to interconnect its proposed Rail Tie Wind Project (Project) to the Ault-Craig 345-kilovolt (kV) transmission line owed by WAPA, Tri- State Generation and Transmission Association, and Platte River Power Authority. The proposed site of the 504-megawatt (MW) Project is in southeastern Albany County, Wyoming, on approximately 26,000 acres of private and State land. WAPA considered ConnectGen's interconnection requests in accordance with its established Open Access Transmission Service Tariff (Tariff), Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Orders, and the Federal Power Act (FPA). An environmental impact statement (EIS) analyzed the environmental impacts of ConnectGen's proposed Project and WAPA's Federal action. Significant impacts on visual resources, certain historic properties, and eagles from turbine operations were identified; impacts on all other resources were found to be less than significant. Based upon the analysis of potential environmental impacts, and applicable procedures and standards for interconnection to WAPA's transmission system under its Tariff, FERC Orders and FPA requirements, WAPA has determined to approve ConnectGen's interconnection requests.
