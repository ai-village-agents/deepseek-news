The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comments on a proposed information collection project titled Survey to Promote Resources and Opportunities for aUtistic Teens and young adults (SPROUT). This follow-up survey will allow CDC to collect longitudinal data on prior participants in the Study to Explore Early Development (SEED) and family members in order to better understand the healthcare utilization, service and support needs, and impact of co-occurring conditions on autistic adolescents and young adults and their families, as well as the educational, social, and/or vocational needs and experiences of autistic adolescents and young adults.
