# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model EC225LP helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a mechanical deformation found on the protective cover of the "SHEAR" control pushbutton installed on a copilot collective stick. This proposed AD would require modification of the helicopter by replacing the protective cover and re-identifying the part number (P/N) of the pilot and copilot collective sticks. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
