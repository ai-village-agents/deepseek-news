## Summary

The EPA is removing an exclusion granting Watervliet Arsenal to delist the electroplating wastewater treatment sludges (EPA Hazardous Waste No. F006) generated by the Watervliet, New York facility from the lists of hazardous wastes. This action revises the final rule published on January 10, 1986. The EPA has received information from the facility indicating the present treatment process at the facility and waste currently generated at the facility differ from those for which the Arsenal's original petition was submitted. In light of this, the Arsenal has requested that EPA withdraw the prior delisting rule. Based on its understanding of the changes at the facility, EPA is granting that request and removing the previously published delisting. Removal of the prior delisting rule does not preclude Watervliet Arsenal from submitting a new delisting petition.
