## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations to implement its authority under Section 161A of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. This final rule applies to several classes of facilities as well as activities involving the transportation of radioactive material and other property designated by the NRC. This final rule also revises the physical security event notification requirements for different classes of facilities and the transportation of radioactive material to add consistency and clarity. Further, the NRC is adding new event notification requirements associated with the possession of enhanced weapons and imminent or actual hostile acts, and new reporting requirements for suspicious activity. The NRC also is issuing a final implementation guidance for this final rule.
