## Summary

The United States (U.S.) General Services Administration (GSA) is issuing a final rule amending the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) to remove the relocation miscellaneous expenses allowance (MEA) lump sum amounts from the FTR. These lump sum amounts will be published in FTR Bulletins on an intermittent basis, much like what is done for per diem and mileage rates. The relocation MEA actual expense (as opposed to lump sum) amounts are unchanged and will remain in the FTR. This final rule also updates the types of expenses that may or may not be reimbursed by relocation MEA when employees itemize under actual expense. Additionally, this final rule updates and clarifies other relocation MEA regulatory sections and rearranges them into a more sequential order.
