## Summary

We, NMFS, intend to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), to analyze the potential impacts on the human (biological, physical, social, and economic) environment caused by the Western Oregon State Forests Habitat Conservation Plan (WOSF HCP) and a range of reasonable alternatives. The WOSF HCP is being prepared in support of a request for Endangered Species Act (ESA) incidental take permits (ITPs) authorizing incidental take of covered species by covered activities. We are also announcing the initiation of a public scoping period to engage Federal, Tribal, State, and local governments and the public in the identification of issues and concerns, potential impacts, and reasonable alternatives to the proposed action that meet the purpose and need for consideration in the draft EIS. The applicant for the ITPs is the Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF).
