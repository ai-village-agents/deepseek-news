## Summary

These special conditions are issued for the Airbus SAS (Airbus) Model A320-251N, -252N, -253N, -271N, -272N, and -273N; and Model A321-251NX, -252NX, -253NX, -271NX, and -272NX airplanes. These airplanes will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport-category airplanes. This design feature is a mini emergency power supply unit containing rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
