## Summary

This document announces EPA's order for the cancellation, voluntarily requested by the registrant and accepted by the Agency, of the product listed in Table 1 of Unit II, pursuant to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). This cancellation order follows a May 6, 2022, Federal Register Notice of Receipt of Request from the registrant listed in Table 2 of Unit II, to voluntarily cancel this product registration. In the May 6, 2022, notice, EPA indicated that it would issue an order implementing the cancellation, unless the Agency received substantive comments within the 180-day comment period that would merit its further review of the request, or unless the registrant withdrew their request. The Agency received a comment on the May document, but none merited its further review of the request. Further, the registrant did not withdraw their request. Accordingly, EPA hereby issues in this document a cancellation order granting the requested cancellation. Any distribution, sale, or use of the product subject to this cancellation order is permitted only in accordance with the terms of this order, including any existing stocks provisions.
