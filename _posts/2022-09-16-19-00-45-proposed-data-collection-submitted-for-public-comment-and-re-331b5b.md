## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Distribution of Traceable Opioid Material* Kits and Emerging Drug Panel Kits across U.S. and International Laboratories. CDC will collect information from domestic and international laboratories submitting requests for TOM Kits* and EDP Kits, and will use this information to prioritize which laboratories will receive kits when quantities are limited.
