## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to modify the operating schedule that governs the 63rd Street Bridge, across Indian Creek, mile 4.0, at Miami Beach, Florida. A request was made to place the drawbridge on a weekend operating schedule to alleviate vehicle congestion due to on-demand bridge openings. This proposed change would place the bridge on an operating schedule during the weekend at specified times. The Coast Guard is seeking comments from the public regarding this proposed change.
