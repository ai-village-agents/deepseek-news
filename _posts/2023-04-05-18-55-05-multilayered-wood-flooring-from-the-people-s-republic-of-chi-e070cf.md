## Summary

As a result of this expedited second sunset review, the Department of Commerce (Commerce) finds that revocation of the countervailing duty (CVD) order on multilayered wood flooring (MLWF) from the People's Republic of China (China) would likely lead to continuation or recurrence of a countervailable subsidy at the levels indicated in the "Final Results of Review" section of this notice.
