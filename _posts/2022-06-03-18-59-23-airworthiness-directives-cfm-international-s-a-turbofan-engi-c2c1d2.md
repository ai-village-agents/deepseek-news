## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all CFM International, S.A. (CFM) LEAP-1B21, LEAP-1B23, LEAP-1B25, LEAP- 1B27, LEAP-1B28, LEAP-1B28B1, LEAP-1B28B2, LEAP-1B28B2C, LEAP-1B28B3, LEAP-1B28BBJ1, and LEAP-1B28BBJ2 model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by the detection of melt-related freckles in the billet, which may reduce the life of certain compressor rotor stages 6-10 spools, high pressure turbine (HPT) rotor mid seals, HPT rotor stage 2 disks, low pressure turbine (LPT) stage 2 disks, and LPT stage 3 disks. This AD requires revising the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the applicable CFM LEAP-1B Engine Shop Manual (ESM), and the operator's existing approved maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate reduced life limits for these parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
