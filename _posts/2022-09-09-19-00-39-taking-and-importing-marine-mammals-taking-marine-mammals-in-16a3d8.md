## Summary

NMFS has received a petition from Empire Offshore Wind LLC (Empire), a 50-50 partnership between Equinor and BP, requesting authorization to take small numbers of marine mammals incidental to activities associated with the Empire Wind Project in a designated lease area on the Outer Continental Shelf (OSC-A 0512) offshore of New York state over the course of 5 years beginning in 2024. Equinor will be the operator through the development, construction, and operations phase of the project. Pursuant to regulations implementing the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), NMFS is announcing receipt of Empire's request for the development and implementation of regulations governing the incidental taking of marine mammals and issuance of a Letter of Authorization (LOA). NMFS invites the public to provide information, suggestions, and comments on Empire's application and request.
