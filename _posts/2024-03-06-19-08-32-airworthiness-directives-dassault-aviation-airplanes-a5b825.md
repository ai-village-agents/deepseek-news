## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-02-10, which applies to certain Dassault Aviation Model FALCON 7X, FALCON 900EX, and FALCON 2000EX airplanes. AD 2022-02-10 requires replacement of certain titanium screws. Since the FAA issued AD 2022- 02-10, affected parts have been found in other areas of certain Falcon 7X airplanes as well as in additional Falcon 7X airplanes. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2022-02-10, add other locations for screw replacement, and revise the applicability, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
