## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the completion of the review of WaterSense product performance criteria as required under the America's Water Infrastructure Act (AWIA) of 2018. The AWIA required the EPA to consider for review and revision, if necessary, specifications which were released prior to 2012. The EPA has completed its review and made the decision not to revise any specifications. A summary of the review and findings are included in this document. Additionally, this document announces that the EPA is seeking input and requesting information on any data, surveys, or studies to help assess consumer satisfaction with WaterSense labeled products, which could inform future product specification development. The EPA is also seeking input on how to design a study or studies to inform future reviews that incorporate customer satisfaction considerations. The results of these studies could inform future Agency action when developing criteria for labeling products in the WaterSense program. The EPA is also requesting input on whether it should include consumer satisfaction criteria into the WaterSense program guidelines and, if included, what criteria should be considered and how.
