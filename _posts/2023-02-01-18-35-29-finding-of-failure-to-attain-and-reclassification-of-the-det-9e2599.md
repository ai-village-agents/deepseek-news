## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is determining that the Detroit area failed to attain the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) by the applicable attainment date. The effect of failing to attain by the applicable attainment date is that the Detroit area will be reclassified by operation of law to "Moderate" nonattainment for the 2015 ozone NAAQS on March 1, 2023, the effective date of this final rule. Accordingly, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) must submit State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions and implement controls to satisfy the statutory and regulatory requirements for Moderate areas for the 2015 ozone NAAQS according to the deadlines established in this final rule.
