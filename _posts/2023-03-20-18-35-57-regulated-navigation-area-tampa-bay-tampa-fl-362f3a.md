## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to revise existing regulations for a Regulated Navigation Area in Tampa Bay, Florida by updating the geographic boundaries of Egmont Channel in the Gulf of Mexico. The proposed change is designed to align the coordinates in the regulation with the coordinates needed to properly control traffic in the Captain of the Port St. Petersburg Zone. The current coordinates do not reflect the Regulated Navigation Area that the Coast Guard intended to put in place. The Coast Guard invites your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
