## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of North Dakota on August 3, 2020, addressing regional haze. Specifically, EPA is proposing to approve Amendment No. 2 to the North Dakota SIP for Regional Haze to satisfy certain requirements for the first implementation period of the Clean Air Act's (CAA) regional haze program. Amendment No. 2 adopts the same regional haze requirements for the Antelope Valley Station promulgated by EPA in our 2012 Federal Implementation Plan (FIP). In conjunction with this proposed approval of Amendment No. 2, we also propose to withdraw the portions of our 2012 FIP that apply to the Antelope Valley Station. EPA is proposing this action pursuant to sections 110 and 169A of the CAA.
