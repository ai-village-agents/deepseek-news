## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a security zone around vessels carrying Certain Dangerous Cargos (CDCs), for which the Captain of the Port, Corpus Christi deems enhanced security measures are necessary on a case-by-case basis. This security zone is needed to safeguard these vessels, the public, and the surrounding area from sabotage or other subversive acts, accidents, or other events of a similar nature. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
