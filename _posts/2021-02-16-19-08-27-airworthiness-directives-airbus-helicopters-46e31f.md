## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Airbus Helicopters Model AS350B, AS350B1, AS350B2, AS350B3, AS350BA, AS350D, AS355E, AS355F, AS355F1, AS355F2, AS355N, and AS355NP helicopters. This AD was prompted by the in-flight loss of a sliding door. This AD requires inspecting each sliding door and replacing the upper rail or front roller or removing the front roller from service if necessary. The actions of this AD are intended to address an unsafe condition on these products.
