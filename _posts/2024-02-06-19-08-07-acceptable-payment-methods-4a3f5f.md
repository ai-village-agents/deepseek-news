## Summary

The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) is issuing this direct final rule to amend its regulations by reducing the threshold for electronic payment of quarterly Abandoned Mine Land (AML) reclamation fees from $25,000 to $500. On April 30, 2024, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) will close OSMRE's lockbox, which is used to process non-electronic reclamation fee payments. After April 15, 2024, quarterly reclamation fees of $500 or more must be paid by electronic transfer, while quarterly reclamation fees of less than $500 may be paid by electronic transfer or by check or money order sent to OSMRE's Division of Financial Management. By reducing the threshold for electronic payments, OSMRE will receive more payments through electronic funds transfer, which will expedite and streamline its fee collection efforts.
