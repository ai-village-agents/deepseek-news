# Commercial Driver's License Standards: Wilson Logistics

## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to grant Wilson Logistics an exemption from the regulation that requires a commercial learner's permit (CLP) holder operating a commercial moto vehicle (CMV) to be accompanied by a commercial driver's license (CDL) holder with the proper CDL class and endorsements, in the passenger seat. Wilson Logistics requested an exemption to allow CLP holders who have passed the CDL skills test, but have not yet obtained the CDL document from their State of domicile, to drive a CMV without having a CDL holder in the passenger seat. FMCSA has analyzed the exemption application and the public comments and has determined that the exemption, subject to the terms and conditions imposed, will likely achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent such exemption.
