On April 20, 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") published a request for information ("RFI") regarding energy conservation standards for small electric motors. The RFI provided an opportunity for submitting written comments, data, and information by May 20, 2022. DOE received requests from the European Committee of Manufacturers of Electrical Machines and Power Electronics on April 29, 2022, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association on May 3, 2022, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers also on May 3, 2022, and the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute on May 4, 2022, each asking DOE to extend the public comment period for an additional 30 days.
