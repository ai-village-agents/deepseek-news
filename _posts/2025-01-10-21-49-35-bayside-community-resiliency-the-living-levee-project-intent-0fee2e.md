## Summary

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) and the City of Imperial Beach propose to act in partnership to prepare a joint draft Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to evaluate the impacts on the environment related to the repurposing of a 1.2-mile segment of the Bayshore Bikeway corridor and adjacent pathways into a multi-benefit coastal resilience corridor. This corridor runs through the southwestern portion of the San Diego Bay National Wildlife Refuge and the adjacent Bayside neighborhood of the City of Imperial Beach. The purpose of the coastal resilience corridor is to improve flood protection for the adjacent community, which is vulnerable to coastal flooding, by converting the existing circulation corridor into a nature-based coastal flood resilience system; provide safe land-based public access along San Diego Bay; and strengthen ecosystem resilience by providing transitional habitat areas along the San Diego Bay's edge. The unique identification number for this project is 2025-0003688-NEPA- 001. The Service is providing this notice to open a public scoping period in accordance with the requirements of NEPA and its implementing regulations. We invite comment from the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies.
