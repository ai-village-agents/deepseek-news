## Summary

The Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM Bank), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, invites the general public and other Federal Agencies to comment on the proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. EXIM Bank has an electronic disbursement approval processing system for guaranteed lenders with Credit Guarantee Facilities. After a Credit Guarantee Facility (CGF) has been authorized by EXIM Bank and legal documentation has been completed, the lender will obtain and review the required disbursement documents (e.g., invoices, bills of lading, Exporter's Certificate, etc.) and will disburse the proceeds of the loan for eligible goods and services. In order to obtain approval of the disbursement, the lender will access and complete an electronic questionnaire through EXIM Bank's online application system (EXIM Online). Using the form, the lender will input key data and request EXIM Bank's approval of the disbursement. EXIM Bank's action (approved or denied) is posted on the lender's history page. The information collected in the questionnaire will assist EXIM Bank in determining that each disbursement under a Medium-Term Guarantee meets all the terms and conditions for approval. The information collection tool can be reviewed at: http:// exim.gov/sites/default/files/pub/pending/eib12-02.pdf.
