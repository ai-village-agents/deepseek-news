## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is implementing in regulation the Charles Duncan Buried with Honor Act of 2016, which expanded the casket and urn authority to apply to eligible veteran burials in State and Tribal cemeteries that received a VA cemetery grant. In addition, VA is establishing flat-rate allowances for caskets and urns, which will be adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Additionally, VA is updating the specifications for caskets based on feedback from funeral directors and other funeral industry professionals. Finally, VA is eliminating the retroactive reimbursement provisions since the relevant applicability period has passed.
