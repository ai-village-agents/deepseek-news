## Summary

South Carolina has applied to the EPA for final authorization of changes to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended. The EPA has reviewed South Carolina's application and has determined, subject to public comment, that these changes satisfy all requirements needed to qualify for final authorization. Therefore, in the "Rules and Regulations" section of this Federal Register, we are authorizing South Carolina for these changes as a direct final action without a prior proposed rule. If we receive no adverse comment, we will not take further action on this proposed rule.
