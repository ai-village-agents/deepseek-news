## Summary

The FAA has determined to extend through October 28, 2023, the limited, conditional waiver of the minimum usage requirement that applies to Operating Authorizations or "slots" at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), New York LaGuardia Airport (LGA), and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) due to post-pandemic effects on Air Traffic Controller (ATC) staffing at the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facility (N90) the FAA has already made available through September 15, 2023. Carriers will be permitted to voluntarily turn in up to 10 percent of their slots held at JFK and LGA as well as impacted slots at DCA for the period from September 16, 2023, through October 28, 2023. In addition, the FAA has determined to extend through October 28, 2023, the limited policy for prioritizing returned operations at Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) due to post-pandemic effects on ATC staffing at N90 for purposes of establishing a carrier's operational baseline in the next corresponding season. Carriers will be permitted to voluntarily turn in up to 10 percent of their approved operating timings at EWR for the period from September 16, 2023, through October 28, 2023. These extensions through October 28, 2023, are available on the same conditions and limitations as the relief that the FAA already has announced through September 15, 2023. Carriers seeking to take advantage of this relief must identify the slots and approved operating timings they wish to return to the FAA before September 2, 2023.
