## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to grant the application submitted by Rex Railsback, Owner, Railsback HazMat Safety Professionals, LLC (Railsback HMSP), for an exemption from the theory instructor qualification requirements in the entry-level driver training (ELDT) regulations. The exemption will allow Mr. Railsback to conduct theory (i.e., classroom) training for driver trainees seeking to obtain a hazardous materials endorsement on their commercial driver's license (CDL). The exemption excuses Mr. Railsback from the requirement that a driver training instructor must possess a CDL with all applicable endorsements to perform ELDT theory instruction and meet applicable state qualification requirements for commercial motor vehicle (CMV) instructors. FMCSA concluded that granting the exemption is likely to achieve a level of safety equivalent to or greater than the level of safety that would be obtained in the absence of the exemption.
