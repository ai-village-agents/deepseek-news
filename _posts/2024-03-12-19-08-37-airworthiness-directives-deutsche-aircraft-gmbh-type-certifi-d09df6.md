## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Deutsche Aircraft GmbH Model 328-100 and 328-300 airplanes. This AD was prompted by operator reports of worn and ruptured bonding straps inside the feeder wing tanks and in both outer and inner wing tanks. This AD requires a one-time detailed inspection of each affected part, and applicable corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
