The Federal Salary Council will hold a virtual hybrid meeting on Friday, October 28, 2022, at the time shown below. There will be no in-person public gathering for this meeting. The Council is an advisory body composed of representatives of Federal employee organizations and experts in the fields of labor relations and pay policy. The Council makes recommendations to the President's Pay Agent (the Secretary of Labor and the Directors of the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management) about the locality pay program for General Schedule employees under the United States Code. The Council's recommendations cover the establishment or modification of locality pay areas, the coverage of salary surveys, the process of comparing Federal and non-Federal rates of pay, and the level of comparability payments that should be paid. The Council will hear public testimony about the locality pay program, review the results of pay comparisons, and formulate its recommendations to the President's Pay Agent on pay comparison methods, locality pay rates, and locality pay areas and boundaries for 2024. This meeting is open to the public through advance registration. Individuals who wish to provide testimony or present material at the meeting should contact the Office of Personnel Management using the email address provided below. In addition, please be aware that the Council may need to set limits on the time that will be provided for hearing oral testimony in the meeting.
