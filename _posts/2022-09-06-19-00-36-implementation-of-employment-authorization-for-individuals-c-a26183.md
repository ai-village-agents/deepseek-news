## Summary

On June 27, 2022, President Joseph Biden issued a memorandum to the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) determining that it was in the foreign policy interest of the United States to defer, through June 30, 2024, the removal of certain Liberian nationals, and individuals having no nationality who last habitually resided in Liberia, who are present in the United States and to provide them with employment authorization documentation. The memorandum directed the Secretary to make provision for immediate allowance of employment authorization for such individuals. This Notice provides information about Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) for certain eligible Liberian nationals, and individuals having no nationality who last habitually resided in Liberia, and provides information on how eligible individuals may apply for DED-based Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) with USCIS. Through this notice, DHS is providing employment authorization, including procedures for obtaining related documentation, for covered individuals through June 30, 2024, and automatically extending the validity of DED-based EADs bearing a Category Code of A-11 and a "Card Expires" date of March 30, 2020, January 10, 2021, or June 30, 2022, through June 30, 2024. Finally, this Notice provides instructions for DED-eligible Liberians, or individuals without nationality who last habitually resided in Liberia, on how to file for travel authorization.
