## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the DoD is establishing a new system of records titled, "All-domain Anomaly Resolution and Anomalous Phenomena (AARO) Program Records," AARO-0001. This system of records describes the AARO's collection, use, and maintenance of correspondence and reports submitted from current or former U.S. government employees, service members, or contractors with direct knowledge of U.S. Government programs or activities related to Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon (UAP) dating back to 1945. This system also includes correspondence and reports submitted from members of the general public and government-affiliated personnel on reported events related to UAP. The submitted information will be used to carry out AARO's mission, including to inform AARO's congressionally directed Historical Record Report. Additionally, DoD is issuing a direct final rulemaking, which will exempt this system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act, elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register.
