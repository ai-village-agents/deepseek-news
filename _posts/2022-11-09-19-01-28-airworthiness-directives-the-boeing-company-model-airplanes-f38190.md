## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by an evaluation by the design approval holder (DAH) indicating that the skin lap splice at certain stringers is subject to widespread fatigue damage (WFD). This proposed AD would require an inspection for any repair at certain skin lap splices and depending on the configuration, repetitive inspections for buckling, wrinkling, bulging at affected skin lap splices and repair, repetitive inspections for cracking at affected locations common to fuselage skin on the left and right sides and repair, and alternative inspections and on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
