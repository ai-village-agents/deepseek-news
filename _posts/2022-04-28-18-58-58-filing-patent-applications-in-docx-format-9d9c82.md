## Summary

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) recently announced a delay in the effective date of the surcharge fee for certain patent applications that are not filed in DOCX format until January 1, 2023. During the period before the non-DOCX filing surcharge fee becomes effective, the USPTO is encouraging applicants to begin filing patent applications in DOCX format. To address concerns some applicants have raised and to allow applicants to get acclimated to the process of filing applications in DOCX format, the USPTO is providing applicants with the option, on a temporary basis, to submit an applicant-generated PDF version of the application along with the DOCX file(s) when filing an application in Patent Center.
