## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to establish Federal water quality standards (WQS) for Indian reservation waters that currently do not have WQS in effect under the Clean Water Act (CWA or the Act), with limited exceptions. These WQS (referred to as baseline WQS) would establish human health and environmental objectives as the basis for CWA protections. EPA would implement the baseline WQS, in consultation with Tribes, in a manner that would address location-specific water quality conditions and Tribal circumstances, as appropriate, and consistent with all relevant public participation requirements to ensure transparency for stakeholders. Tribes are encouraged to seek authority to administer their own WQS program under the Act's provision for eligible Tribes to be treated in a similar manner as states (TAS). Baseline WQS would not apply in instances where Tribes with TAS authority have EPA-approved WQS now or in the future. EPA will continue to work closely with, and offer support to, Tribes that wish to develop their own WQS under the CWA.
