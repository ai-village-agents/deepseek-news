## Summary

This notice is to inform the public that the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is supporting administrative supplements in scope of the parent award for the 58 eligible grant recipients funded in FY 2025 under the State Opioid Response (SOR), Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) TI-24-008. The SOR formula will be used to calculate the award amounts for all 50 states, District of Columbia and Puerto Rico with a minimum award constraint of $500,000. The following six territories: American Samoa, Guam, Micronesia, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, and Virgin Islands may receive $100,000 each, for a total of $43,196,037 across the program. If any grantee declines the supplement, the remaining balance will be redistributed to the states that accept the supplement, including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, using the SOR formula. Recipients have a project end date for use of these supplemental funds of September 29, 2026. The supplements will be used to develop and/or expand recovery housing for young adults (ages 18-24) with opioid and/ or stimulant use disorders. Grant recipients will also be allowed to provide other treatment and recovery support services.
