## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is proposing to amend the standard of identity for pasteurized orange juice (POJ) by lowering the minimum orange juice soluble solids content from 10.5[deg] to 10[deg] Brix. We tentatively conclude that this proposed amendment will promote honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers and provide industry greater flexibility in the manufacture of pasteurized orange juice. This action, if finalized, will respond to a citizen petition submitted by the Florida Citrus Processors Association Inc. and Florida Citrus Mutual Inc.
