## Summary

On July 9, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order titled "Promoting Competition in the American Economy," which creates a White House Competition Council and directs Federal agency actions to enhance fairness and competition across America's economy. Among other things, the Executive Order directs the Secretary of Agriculture (the Secretary) to prepare a report on concerns and strategies for ensuring that the intellectual property (IP) system, while incentivizing innovation, does not also unnecessarily reduce competition in seed and other input markets. This notice requests comments and information from the public to assist the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA or the Department) in preparing the report required by the Executive Order and advancing policy steps on seeds and other inputs identified in and developed by the report.
