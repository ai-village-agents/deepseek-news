## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing for public comment a draft report entitled NUREG-1482, Revision 4, "Guidelines for Inservice Testing at Nuclear Power Plants: Inservice Testing of Pumps and Valves and Inservice Examination and Testing of Dynamic Restraints (Snubbers) at Nuclear Power Plants." This report provides a basic understanding of the regulatory basis for pump and valve inservice testing (IST) programs and dynamic restraint (snubbers) examination and testing programs at nuclear power plants. It also provides information regarding the NRC's involvement in the development of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) "Operation and Maintenance of Nuclear Power Plants," Division 1, "OM Code: Section IST" (OM Code).
