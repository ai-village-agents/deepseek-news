## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to find that the Detroit, Michigan area is attaining the 2010 sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) and to act in accordance with a request from Michigan to redesignate the area to attainment for the 2010 SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS, because the request meets the statutory requirements for redesignation under the Clean Air Act (CAA). EPA is also proposing to approve Michigan's maintenance plan for the Detroit area. Michigan submitted the request for approval of the Detroit nonattainment area's redesignation and maintenance plan on May 5, 2025. EPA approved Michigan's attainment plan for the Detroit area on May 19, 2025.
