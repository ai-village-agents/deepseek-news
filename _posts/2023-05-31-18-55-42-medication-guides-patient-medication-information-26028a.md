## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is proposing to amend its human prescription drug product labeling regulations for Medication Guides (FDA-approved written prescription drug product information distributed to patients). This action, if finalized, will require applicants to create a new type of Medication Guide, referred to as Patient Medication Information (PMI), for prescription drug products, including biological products, used, dispensed, or administered on an outpatient basis and for blood and blood components transfused in an outpatient setting. PMI would be a one-page document with standardized format and content that would be submitted to FDA for approval. This proposed rule is intended to improve public health by providing patients with clear, concise, accessible, and useful written prescription drug product information delivered in a consistent and easily understood format to help patients use their prescription drug products safely and effectively.
