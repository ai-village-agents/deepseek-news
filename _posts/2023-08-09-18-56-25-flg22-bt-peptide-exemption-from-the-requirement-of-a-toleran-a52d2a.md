## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of Flg22-Bt Peptide in or on all food commodities when used as a plant regulator and inducer of local and systemic resistance in accordance with label directions and good agricultural practices. Elemental Enzymes Ag & Turf, LLC submitted a petition, pursuant to section 408(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(d), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for the biochemical pesticide Flg22-Bt Peptide. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of Flg22-Bt Peptide under FFDCA when used in accordance with this exemption.
