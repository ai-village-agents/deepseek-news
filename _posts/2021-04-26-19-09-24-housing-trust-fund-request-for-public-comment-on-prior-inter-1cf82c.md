## Summary

This document seeks comments regarding the Housing Trust Fund (HTF) program administered by HUD. On January 30, 2015, an interim final rule was published in the Federal Register establishing regulations governing the administration of HTF and the formula that determines how HTF funds are distributed among eligible grantees. In the interim rule, HUD stated its intention to open the interim rule for public comment once funding was made available and the grantees gained experience in administering the HTF program. Since the publication of the interim rule, HTF funds have been allocated to eligible grantees in Federal Fiscal Years 2016 through 2021. Grantees have had adequate time to administer the HTF under the interim rulemaking and gain experience necessary to provide substantive comments on the workability of the HTF program requirements and ways program administration can be improved. In addition to comments on the interim rule, HUD is asking for the public to consider and comment on additional issues that may inform its rulemaking. HUD will consider all comments submitted in undertaking further rulemaking for the HTF.
