U.S. Army Col. Christopher R. McLaud, incoming commander of the 56th Stryker Brigade Combat Team, takes the colors from Brig. Gen. Reece J. Lutz, the 28th Infantry Division Commanding General, during a change of command ceremony Feb. 21, 2026, at Biddle Air National Guard Base, Horsham, Pa. The passing of colors from an out-going commander to an incoming commander ensures that the unit and its soldiers are “never without” official leadership.
