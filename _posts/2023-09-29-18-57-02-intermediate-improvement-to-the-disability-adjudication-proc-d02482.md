# Intermediate Improvement to the Disability Adjudication Process: Including How We Consider Past Work

## Summary

We propose to revise the time period that we consider when determining whether an individual's past work is relevant for purposes of making disability determinations and decisions. Specifically, we would revise the definition of past relevant work (PRW) by reducing the relevant work period from 15 to 5 years. This change would allow individuals to focus on the most current and relevant information about their past work, better reflect the current evidence base on changes over time in worker skill decay and job responsibilities, reduce processing time and improve customer service, and reduce burden on individuals.
