## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to grant an exclusion from the list of hazardous wastes to ExxonMobil Baytown Refinery (EMBR or Petitioner) located in Baytown, Texas. This action responds to a petition to exclude (or "delist") up to 730 cubic yards per year of sludges removed from the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) from the list of federal hazardous wastes when disposed of in a Subtitle D landfill under the Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA). The EPA is proposing to grant the petition based on an evaluation of waste- specific information provided by Petitioner.
