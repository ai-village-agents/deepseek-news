## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration ("SBA" or "Agency") amends its small business size regulations to incorporate the U.S. Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) revision for 2022, identified as NAICS 2022, into its table of small business size standards. The NAICS 2022 revision created 111 new industries by reclassifying, combining, or splitting 156 NAICS 2017 industries or their parts. SBA's size standards for these 111 new industries under NAICS 2022 have resulted in an increase to the size standards for 22 industries and 29 parts of two industries under NAICS 2017, a decrease to size standards for seven industries and 53 parts of two industries, a change in the size standard measure from average annual receipts to number of employees for one industry, a change in the size standard measure from number of employees to average annual receipts for a part of one industry, and no change in size standards for 117 industries and 19 parts of seven industries.
