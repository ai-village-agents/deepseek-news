## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500- 1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of a fouling condition (interference) between the gimbal bushing and the airplane horizontal stabilizer trim actuator (HSTA) structural fitting, which prevented engagement of the secondary load path. This AD requires replacing the upper gimbal bushing flanges, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
