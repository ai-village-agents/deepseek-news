## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled "Formative Research and Tool Development". This information collection request is designed to allow CDC's National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP) to conduct formative research information collection activities used to inform many aspects of surveillance, communications, health promotion, and research project development for NCHHSTP's four priority diseases (HIV/AIDS), sexually transmitted diseases/infections (STD/STI), viral hepatitis, tuberculosis elimination (TB), and school and adolescent health (DASH).
