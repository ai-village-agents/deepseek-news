## Summary

In this final rule, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is amending its regulations governing the safety of hydroelectric projects licensed by the Commission under the Federal Power Act. These regulations will promote the safe operation, effective maintenance, and efficient repair of licensed hydroelectric projects and project works to ensure the protection of life, health, and property in surrounding communities. Specifically, the Commission is revising its regulations to: incorporate two tiers of project safety inspections by independent consultants, codify existing guidance requiring certain licensees to develop an owner's dam safety program and a public safety plan, update existing regulations related to public safety incident reporting, and make various minor revisions.
