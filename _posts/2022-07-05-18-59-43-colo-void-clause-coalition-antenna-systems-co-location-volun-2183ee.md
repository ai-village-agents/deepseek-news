## Summary

The FAA announces an amendment to its Colo Void policy. The FAA last revised its policy regarding the notification requirements and processes for evaluation of potential electromagnetic interference (EMI) for co-location of antenna systems on existing structures previously studied by the FAA on November 21, 2007. Based on an August 4, 2020 request from the Colo Void Clause Coalition (CVCC), the FAA finds that further modifications to this policy are necessary and appropriate. The FAA will add additional frequencies to the list of those not requiring notice to the FAA when added to an existing structure with a current No Hazard Determination.
