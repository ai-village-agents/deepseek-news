## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to list Navasota false foxglove (Agalinis navasotensis), a plant species from Grimes and Tyler Counties, Texas, as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). This determination also serves as our 12-month finding on a petition to list Navasota false foxglove. After a review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that listing the species is warranted. We also propose to designate critical habitat for Navasota false foxglove under the Act. In total, approximately 1.9 acres (0.8 hectares) in Grimes and Tyler Counties, Texas, fall within the boundaries of the proposed critical habitat designation. In addition, we announce the availability of a draft economic analysis of the proposed designation of critical habitat for Navasota false foxglove. If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would add this species to the List of Endangered and Threatened Plants and extend the Act's protections to the species and its designated critical habitat.
