## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is proposing a tobacco product standard that would regulate nicotine yield by establishing a maximum nicotine level in cigarettes and certain other combusted tobacco products. FDA is proposing this action to reduce the addictiveness of these products, thus giving people who are addicted and wish to quit the ability to do so more easily. The proposed product standard is anticipated to benefit the population as a whole. For example, it would help to prevent people who experiment with cigarettes and cigars from developing addiction and using combusted tobacco products regularly.
