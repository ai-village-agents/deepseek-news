# Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Threatened Species Status With Section 4(d) Rule for the Silverspot Butterfly

## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to list a subspecies of butterfly (Speyeria nokomis nokomis), a silverspot butterfly from Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah, as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), with a rule issued under section 4(d) of the Act ("4(d) rule"). This document also serves as our 12-month finding on a petition to list the silverspot. After a review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that listing the subspecies is warranted. If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would add this subspecies to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and extend the Act's protections to the subspecies. We determined that designating critical habitat for this subspecies under the Act is not prudent.
