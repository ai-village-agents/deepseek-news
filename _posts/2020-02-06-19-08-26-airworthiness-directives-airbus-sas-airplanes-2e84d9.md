## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A330-200 Freighter series airplanes, Model A330-200 series airplanes, Model A330-300 series airplanes, Model A340-200 series airplanes, Model A340-300 series airplanes, Model A340-541 airplanes, and Model A340-642 airplanes. This AD was prompted by the absence of a requirement to remove certain Emergency Procedures in the existing Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) after accomplishing a certain modification. This AD requires, for airplanes on which a certain modification is done, revising the AFM by removing certain Emergency Procedures in the AFM, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
