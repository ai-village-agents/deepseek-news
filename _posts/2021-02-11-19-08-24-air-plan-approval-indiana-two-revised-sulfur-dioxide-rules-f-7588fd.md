## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the Indiana sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) State Implementation Plan (SIP). The State of Indiana has requested these SIP revisions in order to satisfy the requirements of a Federal consent decree. If approved, these revisions would limit annual bypass venting limits in the sulfur-containing waste gas emissions from a coking and power generating facility in Lake County, Indiana which is owned and operated by Indiana Harbor Coke Company (IHCC) and Cokenergy LLC (Cokenergy). The revisions would also require Cokenergy to operate and maintain a permanent SO<INF>2</INF> flow rate monitor and improve the percent control capture efficiency of the facility. The rulemaking also includes technical corrections and clarifications that do not have a substantive effect of the application of the rule.
