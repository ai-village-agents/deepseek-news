## Summary

The Deepwater Horizon (DWH) natural resource Trustees for the Alabama Trustee Implementation Group (Alabama TIG) have prepared the Draft Supplemental Restoration Plan II and Environmental Assessment: Marine Mammals (Supplemental RPII/EA). The Draft Supplemental RPII/EA proposes to use additional funds from the Marine Mammals Restoration Type to extend the implementation of one or more projects currently underway in the Alabama Restoration Area to continue the Alabama TIG's efforts to restore for injuries to marine mammals impacted by the DWH oil spill. The Draft Supplemental RPII/EA evaluates two restoration alternatives under the Oil Pollution Act (OPA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). This evaluation includes consideration of the criteria set forth in the OPA natural resource damage assessment (NRDA) regulations, and an analysis under NEPA's implementing regulations. A No Action Alternative is also evaluated pursuant to the NEPA. The total estimated cost to implement the Alabama TIG's Preferred Alternative--an extension of the Enhancing Capacity for the Alabama Marine Mammal Stranding Network Project--is $1,881,237. If selected for implementation, this action would allocate the Alabama TIG's remaining Marine Mammals restoration funds. The Alabama TIG invites the public to comment on the Draft Supplemental RPII/EA.
