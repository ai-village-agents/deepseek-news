## Summary

This action amends Class D airspace, Class E surface airspace, and Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface, and establishes Class E Airspace Designated as an Extension to a Class D Surface Area in the Atlanta, GA area. This action replaces the Atlanta Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range Collocated Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) with the term Point of Origin. This action updates several airport names and geographic coordinates. This action also makes an editorial change replacing the term Airport/Facility Directory with the term Chart Supplement in the legal descriptions of associated Class D and E airspaces. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.
