## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving, under the Clean Air Act (CAA), revised sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) regulations submitted by Ohio on May 23, 2022. Ohio updated its regulations to make changes to facility information, remove requirements for shutdown facilities and units, consolidate county-wide requirements, and revise requirements for the Veolia Fort Hill plant in Miami, Ohio and the DTE St. Bernard facility in Cincinnati, Ohio. EPA believes that the revisions improve the clarity of the rules without affecting the stringency, and therefore is approving the submitted revisions with the exception of selected paragraphs in Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) Chapter 3745-18. EPA proposed to approve this action on January 26, 2023 and received no adverse comments.
