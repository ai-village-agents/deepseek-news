## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is proposing to revoke 18 standards of identity for dairy products. FDA is taking this action as we tentatively conclude that these standards are no longer necessary to promote honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers. This proposed action would reduce redundant regulatory requirements.
