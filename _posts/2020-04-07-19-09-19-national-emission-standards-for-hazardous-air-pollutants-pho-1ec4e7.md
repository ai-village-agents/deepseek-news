## Summary

This action proposes to amend the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for the Phosphoric Acid Manufacturing source category. The proposed amendment is in response to a petition for rulemaking by an industry stakeholder on the mercury emission limit based on the maximum achievable control technology (MACT) floor for existing sources set in a rule that was finalized on August 19, 2015 ("2015 Rule"). All six of the existing calciners used to set this MACT floor were located at the PCS Phosphate Company, Inc. ("PCS Phosphate") facility in Aurora, North Carolina ("PCS Aurora"). PCS Phosphate asserted that data received since the rule's promulgation indicate that the MACT floor did not accurately characterize the average emission limitation achieved by the units used to set the standard. Based on these new data, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to revise the mercury MACT floor for existing calciners.
