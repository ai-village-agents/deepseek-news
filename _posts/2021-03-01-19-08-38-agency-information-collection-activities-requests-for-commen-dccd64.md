## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves the submission of FAA Form 8710-3 for the certification process of agricultural aircraft operators, and other reporting and recordkeeping activities required of agricultural aircraft operators. The information to be collected is necessary to evaluate the applicants' qualifications for certification. This collection also involves the submission of information in petitions for exemption by agricultural aircraft operators, plans for operations over congested areas, and recordkeeping requirements for agricultural aircraft operators.
