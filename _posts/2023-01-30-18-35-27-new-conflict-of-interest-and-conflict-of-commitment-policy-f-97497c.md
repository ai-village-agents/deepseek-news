## Summary

To address undue foreign influence in NASA-supported research and ensure responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars, NASA has developed a new conflict of interest (COI) and conflict of commitment (COC) disclosure policy and an associated term and condition applicable to entities implementing NASA financial assistance awards (i.e., grants or cooperative agreements). Grants Policy and Compliance (GPC) in NASA's Office of Procurement is soliciting public comment on the Agency's proposed policy and term and condition. After obtaining and considering public comment, it is NASA's intention to implement the new policy and term and condition through a revision to the NASA Grant and Cooperative Agreement Manual (GCAM).
