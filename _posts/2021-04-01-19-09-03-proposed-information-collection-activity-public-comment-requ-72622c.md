## Summary

The Administration for Community Living (ACL) is announcing an opportunity for the public to comment on ACL's intention to extend the use of the current PPR data collection necessary to determine grantee compliance with Part B of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 (DD Act). Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), Federal agencies are required to publish a notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of information, including each proposed extension of an existing collection of information, and to allow 60 days for public comment in response to the proposed action. This notice solicits comments on a proposed extension to an existing data collection related to the State Councils on Developmental Disabilities (State Councils) Annual Program Performance Report (PPR). On an annual basis, each Council must submit a PPR to describe the extent to which annual progress is being achieved on the 5-year State plan goals. The PPR will be used by: (1) The Council as a planning document to track progress made in meeting state plan goals; (2) the citizenry of the State as a mechanism for monitoring progress and activities on the plans of the Council; and (3) the Department as a stewardship tool for ensuring compliance with the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act and for monitoring and providing technical assistance (e.g., during site visits), and support for management decision making.
