## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), have received an application from Pauma Estates, Inc., for renewal of an incidental take permit pursuant to the Endangered Species Act. The applicant has requested a renewal that will extend permit authorization by 5 years from the date the permit is reissued. If the permit is renewed, no additional take above the original authorized limit of 10.74 acres of habitat will be authorized. The permit would authorize take of the federally endangered arroyo toad, incidental to otherwise lawful activities associated with the low-effect habitat conservation plan (HCP) for Pauma Estates in San Diego County, California. We invite the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies to comment on the application, which includes the applicant's proposed HCP and the Service's preliminary determination that this HCP qualifies as "low- effect," categorically excluded, under the National Environmental Policy Act. To make this determination, we used our environmental action statement and low-effect screening form, both of which are also available for public review.
