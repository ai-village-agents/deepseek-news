## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-300, -400, and -500 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that a spoiler sensor failure may go undetected by the autothrottle (A/T) computer. This AD requires repetitive built-in test equipment (BITE) tests of the A/T computer to detect a spoiler sensor failure, and corrective action if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
