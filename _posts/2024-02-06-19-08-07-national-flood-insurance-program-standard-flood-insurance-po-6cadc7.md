## Summary

The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), established pursuant to the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, is a voluntary program in which participating communities adopt and enforce a set of minimum floodplain management requirements to reduce future flood damages. Property owners within participating communities are eligible to purchase NFIP flood insurance. This proposed rule would revise the Standard Flood Insurance Policy by adding a new Homeowner Flood Form and five accompanying endorsements. The new Homeowner Flood Form would replace the Dwelling Form as a source of coverage for homeowners of one-to-four family residences. Together, the new Homeowner Flood Form and endorsements would more closely align with property and casualty homeowners insurance and provide increased options and coverage in a more user-friendly and comprehensible format.
