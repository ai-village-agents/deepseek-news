## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-2B16 (604 Variant) airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that some airplanes were delivered without a portable protective breathing equipment (PBE) device located in the left-side forward wardrobe, flight deck, or passenger cabin area of the airplane. This AD requires visually inspecting the forward left side cabin area of the airplane to determine if the portable PBE device is installed and, if not installed, requires installing the portable PBE device along with the associated placard. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
