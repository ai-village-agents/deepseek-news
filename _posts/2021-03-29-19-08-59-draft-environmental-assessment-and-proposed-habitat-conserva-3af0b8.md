## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, have received an application from Hanson Aggregates Midwest, Inc. d/b/a Hanson Material Service (applicant) for an incidental take permit (ITP) under the Endangered Species Act. We make available for public comment the applicant's habitat conservation plan (HCP) for continued limestone surface mining, submitted in support of the ITP application, for the Hine's emerald dragonfly, Blanding's turtle, spotted turtle, leafy prairie clover, and Lakeside Daisy (covered species). If approved, the ITP would be for a 30-year period and would authorize the incidental take of an endangered species, the Hine's emerald dragonfly, and species petitioned for Federal listing that are listed as endangered by the State of Illinois, the Blanding's turtle and spotted turtle. We also announce the availability of a draft environmental assessment, which has been prepared in response to the permit application in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. We request public comment on the application and associated documents.
