# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model H160-B helicopters modified by Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) SR00223IB. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that several self-locking nuts of the window jettisoning system could be loosened by hand due to a non-conformity in the cable kit. This proposed AD would require modifying an affected window into a serviceable window. This proposed AD would also prohibit installing an affected window on any helicopter modified with STC SR00223IB. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
