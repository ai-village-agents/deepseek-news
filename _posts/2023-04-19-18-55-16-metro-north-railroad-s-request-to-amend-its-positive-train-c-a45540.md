## Summary

This document provides the public with notice that, on April 11, 2023, Metro-North Railroad (MNR) submitted a request for amendment (RFA) to its FRA-approved Positive Train Control Safety Plan (PTCSP). As this RFA involves a request for FRA's approval of proposed material modifications to an FRA-certified positive train control (PTC) system, FRA is publishing this notice and inviting public comment on the railroad's RFA to its PTCSP. MNR state that this RFA is for an update to MNR's PTC Onboard Software, release OBC 5.04.000, correcting existing defects. With the successful completion of Factory and Field Testing and Supplier Safety Certification, MNR confirms the changes meet all technical requirements, provide an equivalent or greater level of safety than the existing PTC System in service, and does not adversely impact interoperability with tenant railroads.
