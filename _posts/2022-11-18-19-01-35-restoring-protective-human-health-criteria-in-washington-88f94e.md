## Summary

On April 1, 2022, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determined that Washington's human health criteria (HHC) for certain pollutants were not protective of Washington's designated uses and were not based on sound scientific rationale and, accordingly, proposed to restore protective HHC for those pollutants in Washington's waters. EPA is finalizing protective and science-based Federal HHC in this final rule to protect Washington's waters, including waters where tribes hold treaty-reserved rights to fish.
