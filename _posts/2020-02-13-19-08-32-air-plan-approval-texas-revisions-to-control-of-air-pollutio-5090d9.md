## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) is finalizing approval of revisions to the Texas (TX) State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted on February 22, 2019, that revised the State's New Source Review (NSR) permitting rules contained in Title 30 of the Texas Administrative Code (TAC) Chapter 116 Control of Air Pollution by Air Permits for New Construction or Modification. Our final action on the February 22, 2019, submittal also addresses portions of an April 16, 2014, SIP submittal pertaining to the permitting of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions that were subsequently invalidated by the U.S. Supreme Court. The February 22, 2019, submittal appropriately removes these provisions from the Texas SIP.
