## Summary

The Office of Indian Energy and Economic Development (IEED) proposes a new regulation to implement the recently enacted Native American Business Incubators Program Act. The Indian Business Incubators Program (IBIP), also known as the Native American Business Incubators Program, is a program in which IEED provides competitive grants to eligible applicants to establish and operate business incubators that serve Tribal reservation communities. These regulations establish who is eligible for the program, how to apply, how IEED will evaluate applications and make awards, and how IEED will administer the program.
