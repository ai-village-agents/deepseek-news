## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), designate critical habitat for 12 federally endangered species on the island of Hawai`i under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. In total, approximately 119,326 acres (48,289 hectares) on the island of Hawai`i, in the State of Hawaii, fall within the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. This rule extends the Act's protections to these species' designated critical habitats.
