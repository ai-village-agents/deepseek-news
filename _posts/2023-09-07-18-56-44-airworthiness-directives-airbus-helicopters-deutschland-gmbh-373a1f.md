## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (AHD) Model MBB-BK 117 D-3 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by recalculations of the inspection intervals for certain parts. This proposed AD would require revising the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the existing helicopter maintenance manual or instructions for continued airworthiness for your helicopter and the existing approved maintenance or inspection program for your helicopter, as applicable, to reduce the inspection interval of certain parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
