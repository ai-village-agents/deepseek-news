## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing for public comment a draft regulatory guide (DG), DG-1409, "Guidelines for Lightning Protection for Production and Utilization Facilities." This DG is the proposed Revision 1 of Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.204, "Guidelines for Lightning Protection of Nuclear Power Plants." DG- 1409 describes an approach that is acceptable to the staff of the NRC to meet regulatory requirements for adequate lightning protection of safety-related systems, structures, and components (SSCs). This DG endorses, with clarifications, the methods described in Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standard (Std.) 665-1995, "IEEE Standard for Generating Station Grounding"; IEEE Std. 666-2007, "IEEE Design Guide for Electrical Power Service Systems for Generating Stations"; IEEE Std. 1050-2004, "IEEE Guide for Instrumentation and Control Equipment Grounding in Generating Stations"; and IEEE Std. C62.23-2017, "IEEE Application Guide for Surge Protection of Electric Generating Plants."
