## Summary

The Department of Justice ("Department") is correcting a final rule that appeared in the Federal Register on April 26, 2022, with an effective date of August 24, 2022. The final rule amended Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives ("ATF") regulations by removing and replacing the regulatory definitions of "firearm frame or receiver" and "frame or receiver." The document also amended ATF's definitions of "firearm" and "gunsmith" to clarify the meaning of those terms, and to provide definitions of terms such as "complete weapon," "complete muffler or silencer device," "multi-piece frame or receiver," "privately made firearm," and "readily" for purposes of clarity given advancements in firearms technology. Additionally, the final rule amended ATF's regulations on marking and recordkeeping that are necessary to implement the new or amended definitions. This document makes some minor technical corrections to the final rule, which otherwise remains the same as previously published.
