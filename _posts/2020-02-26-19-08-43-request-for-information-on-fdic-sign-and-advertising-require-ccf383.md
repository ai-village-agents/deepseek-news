## Summary

The FDIC is seeking input regarding potential modernization of its sign and advertising rules to reflect that deposit-taking via physical branch, digital, and mobile banking channels continues to evolve since the FDIC last significantly updated its rules in 2006. As banks adjust their business models to innovate and remain competitive, the FDIC is considering how to revise and clarify its sign and advertising rules related to FDIC deposit insurance. The FDIC is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to inform FDIC efforts to align the policy objectives of its rules and keep pace with how today's banks offer deposit products and services and how consumers connect with banks, including through evolving channels. The FDIC is also seeking input on how to address potential misrepresentations by nonbanks about deposit insurance. In addition, the FDIC requests information about how technological or other solutions could be leveraged to help consumers better distinguish FDIC-insured banks and savings associations from entities that are not insured by the FDIC (nonbanks), particularly across web and digital channels.
