## Summary

Under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) offers the public and Federal agencies the opportunity to comment regarding the NTSB's submission of an Information Collection Request (ICR) for an extension of a currently-approved information collection (IC) for Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Control No. 3147-0028. The OMB number, which is currently assigned to the NTSB's Request for a Medical Exception to the COVID-19 Vaccination Requirement form, was obtained through emergency clearance in November 2021 and will expire on May 31, 2022. The NTSB published a 60-Day Notice in December 2021, soliciting comments until February 15, 2022. With no comments received, the NTSB is issuing this 30-Day Notice, informing the public and Federal agencies to submit comments directly to the Office of Information & Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) regarding this ICR.
