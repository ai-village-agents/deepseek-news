## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Saab AB, Support and Services Model 340A (SAAB/SF340A) and SAAB 340B airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of a high number of events related to stall warnings upon landing, following introduction of the ice speed function within the stall warning system. This AD requires modification of the stall warning/identification system, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
