## Summary

This proposed rule would amend the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regulations that govern the monthly assistance allowance for eligible veterans in the United States (U.S.) Olympic or Paralympic Events. We are amending these regulations to conform with the governing statute and to codify current VA policy, which would make the process for applying for the monthly assistance allowance more transparent. We would also make edits to outdated terminology.
