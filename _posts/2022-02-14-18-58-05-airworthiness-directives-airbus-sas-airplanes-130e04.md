## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that during type certification activity, it was identified that certain monitoring software was incorrectly implemented in the braking control system (BCS) certification standard. This AD requires installing (updating) certain software for the braking and steering system, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
