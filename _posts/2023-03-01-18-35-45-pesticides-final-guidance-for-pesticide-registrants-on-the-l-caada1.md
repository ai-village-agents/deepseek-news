## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the availability of a final Pesticide Registration Notice (PR Notice) entitled, "Lists of Pests of Significant Public Health Importance" and identified as PR Notice 2023-1. PR Notices are issued by the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) to inform pesticide registrants and other interested persons about important policies, procedures, and registration related decisions, and serve to provide guidance to pesticide registrants and OPP personnel. This PR Notice updates and replaces the PR Notice 2002-1, which identifies pests of significant public health importance. The Health and Human Services (HHS), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determined that updating the lists to reflect the current public health situation were warranted because vector-borne diseases and related research has changed significantly since the original PR Notice was published almost 20 years ago. This update includes the addition or removal of pests, new impacts, renaming pests, or grouping pests of similar species.
