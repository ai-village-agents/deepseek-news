## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace at Carrington, ND; Cooperstown, ND; Harvey, ND; Rolla, ND; and Walhalla, ND. The FAA is proposing this action due to airspace reviews conducted as part of the decommissioning of the Devils Lake very high frequency (VHF) omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimal Operational Network (MON) Program. The name of Rolla Municipal Airport/ Leonard Krech Field, Rolla, ND, would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
