## Summary

This action amends a final rule published by the FAA in the Federal Register on December 7, 2022, that, among other actions, amended area navigation (RNAV) route T-224 by removing the AXEJA, AL, computer navigation fix (CNF) from the route description. This action re-inserts AXEJA into the T-224 description as an RNAV waypoint (WP) instead of a CNF. This action is necessary to match the FAA National Airspace System Resource (NASR) database information.
