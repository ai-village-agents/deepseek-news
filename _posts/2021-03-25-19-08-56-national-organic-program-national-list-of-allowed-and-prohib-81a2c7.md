# National Organic Program; National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances-Crops and Handling From October 2019 NOSB

## Summary

This proposed rule would amend the National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances (National List) section of the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) organic regulations to add potassium hypochlorite for pre-harvest use as a sanitizer in organic crop production and fatty alcohols for sucker control in organic tobacco production. In addition, this rule proposes to remove the listing for dairy cultures, as it is redundant with an existing listing.
