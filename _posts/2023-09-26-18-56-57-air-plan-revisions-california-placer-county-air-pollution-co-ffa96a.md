## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action on two permitting rules submitted as a revision to the Placer County Air Pollution Control District (PCAPCD or "District") portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). We are finalizing an approval of one rule and finalizing a limited approval and limited disapproval of the second rule. These revisions concern the District's New Source Review (NSR) permitting program for new and modified sources of air pollution under title I of the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act"). This final action stops all sanction and federal implementation plan clocks started by our April 20, 2020 limited approval and limited disapproval. This action also adds regulatory text to clarify that Placer County is no longer subject to the Federal Implementation Plan related to protection of visibility.
