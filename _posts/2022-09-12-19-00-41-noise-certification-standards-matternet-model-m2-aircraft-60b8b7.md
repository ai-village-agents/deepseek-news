## Summary

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is promulgating noise certification standards that apply only to the Matternet Model M2 quadcopter unmanned aircraft (UA) because no generally applicable noise standards were available for this aircraft at the time the aircraft was presented for certification. Therefore, to complete the Matternet Model M2's type certification process for noise, the FAA adopts the standards in this rule for the Matternet Model M2.
