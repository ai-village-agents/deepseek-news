## Summary

The United States Housing Act of 1937 provides for assisted housing for "low-income families" and "very low-income families." These designations are defined as percentages of area median family income and are known as income limits. Since FY 2010, HUD has limited the increase from year to year in its income limits as the higher of five percent or twice the percentage change in national median family income. This notice adds an express stipulation that the annual income limit increase may never exceed ten percent. HUD further clarifies the definition of national median family income for purposes of setting income limits.
