## Summary

On December 28, 2017, the State of Alaska (State) filed an application with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for a recordable disclaimer of interest (RDI) from the United States for the submerged lands underlying portions of the Goodnews River System, east of Goodnews Bay in western Alaska. On December 16, 2020, the BLM received a letter from the State which amended that application to remove Slate Creek. Thus, the final application includes the submerged lands for portions of Goodnews River, Goodnews Lake, Igmiumanik River, South Fork of the Goodnews River, Tivyagik Creek, an unnamed tributary of Tivyagik Creek, the Middle Fork of the Goodnews River, Middle Fork Lake, Kukaktlik River, and Kukaktlim Lake east of Goodnews Bay, Alaska. An RDI, if issued, would disclaim the United States' interest in the lands underlying the portions of the waterbodies in the RDI application. This notice informs the public of the pending RDI application and supporting evidence submitted by the State and requests additional information related to the waterbodies in the application.
