## Summary

We are requesting your comments on planned actions that will allow the Coast Guard to prioritize lifesaving missions and protection of the Marine Transportation System in light of current personnel shortages. Like other military services, the Coast Guard is facing an unprecedented workforce shortage that is impacting Service readiness. The current and forecasted extent of the shortage is prompting significant actions to best protect the American public and maintain Service readiness. If actions are not taken to adjust operations, we can anticipate longer-term impacts to mission effectiveness and increased risk to our service members, as well as to commercial mariners and private boaters. In addition to leveraging technology and enhancing recruitment and retention efforts, operational adjustments must be executed within the existing response system while maintaining standards and an adherence to core mission execution. These adjustments fall into two categories: First, in regions where multiple units could respond if they were resourced appropriately, boats and people will be consolidated at one or more units to ensure a robust response. Secondly, in areas where the Coast Guard operates limited, or seasonal units that do not have sufficient personnel to respond, operations will be temporarily paused as resources are moved to higher priority areas. These adjustments will remain in effect until the Coast Guard has sufficient personnel to reconstitute these units.
