## Summary

AHRQ invites public comment on its Request for Information (RFI) about a potential Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS[supreg]) survey to assess patient care experiences in inpatient mental healthcare settings. Specifically, this RFI seeks comment regarding methodologically sound survey and data collection approaches of care experiences of those receiving inpatient mental healthcare. In addition, this RFI seeks comments about any unique considerations or concerns associated with collection of such patient care experience information. There currently is no CAHPS instrument designed to measure care from the patient perspective in this setting. This request for information will help inform the development of a scientifically sound survey to measure the experience of patients receiving inpatient mental healthcare.
