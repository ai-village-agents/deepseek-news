## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to list two Florida species, the Key ring-necked snake (Diadophis punctatus acricus) and the rim rock crowned snake (Tantilla oolitica), and propose to designate critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). This determination also serves as our 12-month finding on the petition to list the Key ring-necked snake and the rim rock crowned snake. After a review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that listing both species is warranted. Accordingly, we propose to list both species as endangered species under the Act. If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would add the species to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and extend the Act's protections to both species. We also propose to designate critical habitat for the Key ring-necked snake and the rim rock crowned snake under the Act. In total, approximately 2,604 acres (ac) (1,054) hectares (ha) in Monroe County, Florida, and approximately 5,972 ac (2,418 ha) in Miami-Dade County and Monroe County, Florida, fall within the boundaries of the proposed critical habitat designation for the Key ring-necked snake and the rim rock crowned snake, respectively. We announce the availability of a draft economic analysis of the proposed designation of critical habitat for both species.
