## Summary

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) is extending for an additional 120 days the comment periods for two notices of proposed rulemaking it published on January 17, 2025. The first proposes to require disclosure of per-serving alcohol, calorie, and nutrient content information in an "Alcohol Facts" statement on the labels of alcohol beverages subject to the authority of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act) (Notice No. 237), while the second proposes to require labeling of major food allergens used in the production of alcohol beverages on such labels (Notice No. 238). TTB is taking this action to provide additional time for public comments in response to requests received during the comment period.
