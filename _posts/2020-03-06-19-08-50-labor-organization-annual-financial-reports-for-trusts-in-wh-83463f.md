## Summary

In this rule, the Department revises the forms required by labor organizations under the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act ("LMRDA" or "Act"). Under the rule, specified labor organizations file annual reports (Form T-1) concerning trusts in which they are interested. This document also sets forth the Department's review of and response to comments on the proposed rule. Under this rule, the Department requires a labor organization with total annual receipts of $250,000 or more (and, which therefore is obligated to file a Form LM-2 Labor Organization Annual Report) to also file a Form T-1, under certain circumstances, for each trust of the type defined by section 3(l) of the LMRDA (defining "trust in which a labor organization is interested"). Such labor organizations will trigger the Form T-1 reporting requirements, subject to certain exemptions, where the labor organization during the reporting period, either alone or in combination with other labor organizations, selects or appoints the majority of the members of the trust's governing board or contributes more than 50 percent of the trust's receipts. When applying this financial or managerial dominance test, contributions made pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) shall be considered the labor organization's contributions. The rule provides appropriate instructions and revises relevant sections relating to such reports. The Department issues the rule pursuant to section 208 of the LMRDA.
