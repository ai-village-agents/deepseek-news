## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Pratt & Whitney (PW) PW1519G, PW1521G, PW1521GA, PW1524G, PW1525G, PW1521G-3, PW1524G-3, PW1525G-3, PW1919G, PW1921G, PW1922G, PW1923G, and PW1923G-A model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by reports of in-flight shutdowns due to oil leaking from the connection between the LP10 oil supply tube and the fuel oil cooler (FOC). This AD requires initial and repetitive gap inspections of the LP10 oil supply tube and the FOC and, if a gap is found, replacement of these parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
