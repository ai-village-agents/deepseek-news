## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is making an interim final determination that the California Air Resources Board (CARB) has submitted a Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act") state implementation plan (SIP) revision on behalf of the San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District (SJVUAPCD or "District") that corrects deficiencies concerning the District's new source review (NSR) stationary source permitting program. This determination is based on a proposed approval, published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, of SJVUAPCD Rules 1020, 2020, and 2201. The effect of this interim final determination is to defer sanctions that were triggered by the EPA's limited disapproval of SJVUAPCD Rule 2201 in 2023.
