## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Viking Air Limited (type certificate previously held by Bombardier, Inc. and de Havilland, Inc.) Model DHC-6-1, DHC-6-100, DHC- 6-200, DHC-6-300, and DHC-6-400 airplanes. This AD was prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as loose quadrants on the rudder pedal torque tube and signs of loose rivets or rivet joint wear due to inadequate manufacturing tolerances. This AD requires inspecting the rudder pedal torque tube quadrant for looseness and taking corrective action as necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
