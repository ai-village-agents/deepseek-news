## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a revision to the Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District (MDAQMD) portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). This revision concerns emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) from internal combustion engines. We are approving a local rule that regulates these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the "Act"). The EPA is also making additional administrative updates to the MDAQMD portion of the California SIP by correcting text in the Code of Federal Regulations.
