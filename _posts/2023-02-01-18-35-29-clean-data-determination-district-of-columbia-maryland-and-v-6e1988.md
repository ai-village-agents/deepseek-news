## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to determine that the Washington, District of Columbia-Maryland-Virginia (the Washington Area or the Area) nonattainment area has clean data for the 2015 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standard (2015 ozone NAAQS). This proposed clean data determination (CDD) under EPA's Clean Data Policy is based upon quality-assured, quality-controlled, and certified ambient air quality monitoring data showing that the area has attained the 2015 ozone NAAQS based on 2019 to 2021 data available in EPA's Air Quality System (AQS) database. If finalized, this proposed CDD would suspend the obligations of the District of Columbia (DC), the State of Maryland (MD) and the Commonwealth of Virginia (VA) to submit certain attainment planning requirements for the nonattainment area for as long as the Area continues to attain the 2015 ozone NAAQS.
