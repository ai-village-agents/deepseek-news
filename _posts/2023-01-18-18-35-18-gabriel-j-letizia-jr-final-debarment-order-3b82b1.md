## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) permanently debarring Gabriel J. Letizia, Jr. from providing services in any capacity to a person that has an approved or pending drug product application. FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Letizia was convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct that relates to the regulation of a drug product under the FD&C Act. Mr. Letizia was given notice of the proposed permanent debarment and was given an opportunity to request a hearing to show why he should not be debarred within the timeframe prescribed by regulation. Mr. Letizia has not responded to the notice. Mr. Letizia's failure to respond and request a hearing within the prescribed timeframe constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this action.
