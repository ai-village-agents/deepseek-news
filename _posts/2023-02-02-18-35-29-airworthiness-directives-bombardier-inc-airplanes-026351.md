## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-2B16 (604 Variant) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that during certain modes, the flight guidance/autopilot does not account for engine failure while capturing an altitude. This proposed AD would require revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to add new limitation and procedures. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
