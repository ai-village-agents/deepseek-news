# Magnuson-Stevens Act Provisions; Fisheries of the Northeastern United States; Atlantic Herring Fishery; Framework Adjustment 6 and the 2019-2021 Atlantic Herring Fishery Specifications

## Summary

We are proposing regulations to implement Framework Adjustment 6 to the Atlantic Herring Fishery Management Plan, including the 2019- 2021 fishery specifications and management measures, as recommended by the New England Fishery Management Council. In addition, Framework 6 would update the overfished and overfishing definitions for the herring fishery and suspend the carryover of unharvested catch for 2020-2021. The specifications and management measures are intended to meet conservation objectives while providing sustainable levels of access to the fishery. We are also proposing updating and clarifying specific herring regulations.
