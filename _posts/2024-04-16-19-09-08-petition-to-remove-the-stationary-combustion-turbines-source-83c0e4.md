## Summary

The U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the Agency's decision to deny a petition requesting the removal of the Stationary Combustion Turbines source category from the list of categories of major sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) subject to regulation the Clean Air Act (CAA). The petition was submitted jointly by American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, the American Petroleum Institute, the American Public Power Association, the Gas Turbine Association, the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, and the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association ("the petitioners"). The EPA is denying the petition based on the EPA's determination that the petition is incomplete and because we have found that the submitted information is inadequate to determine that no source in the category emits HAP in quantities that may cause a lifetime risk of cancer greater than 1-in-1 million to the individual in the population who is most exposed to emissions of such pollutants from the source. We have reached this decision based on review of the risk analysis and other information submitted by petitioners and on consideration of turbine testing results received from a CAA information request. The EPA is denying the petition with prejudice and will deny any future petition to delist as a matter of law unless such future petition is accompanied by substantial new information or analysis.
