## Summary

We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), and the Department of the Interior are adopting as final the interim final rule published on January 14, 2022, making amendments to the departmental regulations governing the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund (AML Fund) to be consistent with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), which included the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Amendments of 2021 (the 2021 amendments). The final rule adopts the changes to the regulations reflecting the extension of our statutory authority to collect reclamation fees for an additional 13 years and the 20 percent reduction in fee rates. In addition, the final rule adopts the changes to the regulations reflecting the statutory extension of the dates when moneys derived from these fees will be available for distribution to eligible States and Tribes as grants. The final rule adopts the interim final rule with two revisions to correct grammatical errors. The final rule also corrects two additional grammatical errors in the regulations which were unaffected by the interim final rule.
