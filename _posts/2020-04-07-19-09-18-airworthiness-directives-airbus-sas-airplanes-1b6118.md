## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A320-271N airplanes and Model A321-271N, - 271NX, and -272N airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of a gap found on an engine pylon nose fire seal during an inspection of an in- production airplane. This AD requires a one-time detailed inspection of certain engine pylon nose fire seals for correct installation, and applicable corrective actions if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
