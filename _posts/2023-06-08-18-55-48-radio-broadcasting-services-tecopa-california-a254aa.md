## Summary

This document amends the FM Table of Allotments, of the Federal Communications Commission's (Commission) rules, by substituting Channel 256A for vacant Channel 288A at Tecopa, California to accommodate the hybrid modification application for Station KRZQ(FM), Amargosa Valley, Nevada to specify operation on Channel 291C in lieu of Channel 290C1. A staff engineering analysis indicates that Channel 256A can be allotted to Tecopa, California, consistent with the minimum distance separation requirements of the Commission's rules, with a site restriction of 2.3 km (1.4 miles) northwest of the community. The reference coordinates are 35-50-48 NL and 116-13-27 WL.
