## Summary

Pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, the Pretrial Services Agency for the District of Columbia (an independent entity established within the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency (hereafter "CSOSA" or "Agency")) is issuing a public notice of its intent to create the Pretrial Services Agency for the District of Columbia Privacy Act system of records, the "Employee Religious Exception Request Information System." This system of records maintains personal religious information collected in response to religious accommodation requests for religious exception from the federally mandated vaccination requirement in the context of a public health emergency or similar health and safety incident, such as a pandemic, epidemic, natural disaster or national or regional emergency; and/or any other lawful collection of employee information or data that is necessary to ensure a safe and healthy environment for individuals who are occupying PSA facilities, attending PSA-sponsored events, or otherwise engaged in official business on behalf of the Agency. The system of records will assist the Agency in the collection, storing, dissemination, and disposal of employee religious exemption request information collected and maintained by the Agency, as referenced above.
