## Summary

FMCSA is proposing to narrow the scope of regulations from which relief is provided automatically for motor carriers providing direct assistance when an emergency has been declared. Through the proposed changes, the Agency would ensure that the relief granted through emergency declarations is appropriate and tailored to the specifics of the circumstances and emergency being addressed. The Agency also proposes revisions to the process for extending an automatic emergency exemption where circumstances warrant.
