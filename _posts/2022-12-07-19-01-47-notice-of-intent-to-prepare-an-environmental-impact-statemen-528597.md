## Summary

In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (NEPA), and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, as amended (FLPMA), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Yuma Field Office, Yuma, Arizona, intends to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to consider the effects of the Jove Solar Project (Jove Solar), an up to 600-megawatt (MW) solar photovoltaic (PV) project and battery storage system proposed on 3,495 acres of BLM-administered land in La Paz County, Arizona, and by this notice is announcing the beginning of the scoping process to solicit public comments and identify issues. The BLM also announces the segregation of the 3,495 acres of public lands from appropriation under the public land laws, including the Mining Law, but not the Mineral Leasing or Materials Acts, for a period of 2 years from the date of publication of this notice, subject to valid existing rights. This segregation will facilitate the orderly administration of the public lands while the BLM considers potential solar development on the described parcel.
