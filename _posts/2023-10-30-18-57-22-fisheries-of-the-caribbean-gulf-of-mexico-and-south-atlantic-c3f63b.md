## Summary

NMFS implements an accountability measure for the commercial hook-and-line component of golden tilefish in the South Atlantic exclusive economic zone (EEZ). NMFS projects that commercial landings of golden tilefish harvested by hook-and-line are projected to reach the commercial component quota in the 2023 fishing year. Accordingly, NMFS closes the commercial hook-and-line component for golden tilefish in the South Atlantic EEZ for the remainder of the 2023 fishing year to protect the golden tilefish resource.
