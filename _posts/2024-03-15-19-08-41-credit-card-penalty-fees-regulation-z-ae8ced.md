## Summary

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB or Bureau) amends Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), to address late fees charged by card issuers that together with their affiliates have one million or more open credit card accounts (referred to as "Larger Card Issuers" herein). This final rule adopts a late fee safe harbor threshold of $8 for those issuers and provides that the annual adjustments to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) do not apply to this $8 amount.
