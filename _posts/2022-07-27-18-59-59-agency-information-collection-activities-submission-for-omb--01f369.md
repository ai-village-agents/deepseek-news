## Summary

As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission), announces that the Commission has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request for extension of approval for a collection of information associated with the Standard for the Flammability of Children's Sleepwear: Sizes 0 Through 6X and the Standard for the Flammability of Children's Sleepwear: Sizes 7 Through 14, approved previously under OMB Control No. 3041-0027. On May 11, 2022, CPSC published a notice in the Federal Register announcing the agency's intent to seek this extension. CPSC received no comments in response to that notice. Therefore, by publication of this notice, the Commission announces that CPSC has submitted to the OMB a request for extension of approval of this collection of information.
