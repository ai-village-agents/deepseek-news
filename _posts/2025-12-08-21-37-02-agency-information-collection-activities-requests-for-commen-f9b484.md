## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on September 18, 2025. The collection allows users of both federally obligated and non-obligated airports to activate and deactivate landing areas, change traffic patterns, change use types, and realign landing areas. The information to be collected will be used to understand the impact of proposed actions on existing and planned operating procedures, determine potential hazardous effects and objections, and identify any mitigating measures needed to enhance safe air navigation.
