## Summary

This final rule allocates annual catch entitlements to groundfish sectors for the 2022 fishing year and approves changes to previously approved sector operations plans. This rule also denies four novel sector exemption requests. The action is necessary because sectors must receive allocations in order to operate in fishing year 2022. This action will allow limited access permit holders to continue to operate sectors, and to exempt sectors from certain effort control regulations to improve the efficiency and economics of sector vessels.
