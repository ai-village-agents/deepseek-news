## Summary

The Department of Commerce is amending the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by adding twenty-four entities under twenty-six entries to the Entity List. These entities have been determined by the U.S. Government to be acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States and will be listed on the Entity List under the destinations of Latvia, Pakistan, Russia, Singapore, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.). In addition, this final rule removes from the Entity List one entity listed in three entries under Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the U.A.E.
