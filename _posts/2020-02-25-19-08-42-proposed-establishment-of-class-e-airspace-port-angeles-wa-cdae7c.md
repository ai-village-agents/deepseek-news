# Proposed Establishment of Class E Airspace; Port Angeles, WA

## Summary

This action proposes to establish a Class E surface area, Class E airspace as an extension to the surface area and Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Port Angeles CGAS, Port Angeles, WA. Following a review of the airspace serving Port Angeles CGAS and William R Fairchild International Airport, the FAA found it necessary to provide Port Angeles CGAS with airspace independent of the airspace for William R Fairchild Airport. A microclimate at Port Angeles CGAS causes weather patterns to vary from the weather at William R Fairchild Airport. The difference in weather between the two locations can negatively impact operations at Port Angeles CGAS, impeding training and mission accomplishment. This action would establish new airspace for the safety and management of Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operations at Port Angeles CGAS, Port Angeles, WA.
