## Summary

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission or CPSC), in consultation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), announce their joint intent to conduct a second test (a Beta Pilot) to assess the electronic filing of data from a certificate of compliance (certificate) for regulated consumer products under CPSC's jurisdiction. This electronic filing will be done via the Partner Government Agency (PGA) Message Set, to the CBP-authorized Electronic Data Interchange system known as the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE). In this notice, CPSC seeks Beta Pilot test participants. CPSC is also collecting comments on burden estimates for a proposed collection of information related to the Beta Pilot test, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
