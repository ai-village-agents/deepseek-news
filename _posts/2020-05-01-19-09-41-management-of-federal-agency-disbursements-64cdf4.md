## Summary

The Department of the Treasury (Treasury), Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service or "we"), is adopting the changes proposed in its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for its regulation that requires electronic delivery of all Federal payments aside from tax payments. The final rule eliminates obsolete references in the regulation, including references to the Electronic Transfer Account (ETA\SM\). In addition, the final rule provides for the disbursement of non-benefit payments, including tax payments, through Treasury- sponsored accounts, such as the U.S. Debit Card. The final rule does not mandate the electronic delivery of tax payments or affect the Direct Express[supreg] program, which will continue to be available to recipients of benefit payments.
