## Summary

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) intends to prepare a programmatic environmental assessment (PEA) to consider the potential environmental impacts associated with the research, development, testing and evaluation (RDT&E) of counter-unmanned aircraft systems (C- UAS), and nationwide C-UAS operational and training activities (Proposed Action). DHS is seeking public input regarding important environmental issues that should be considered in the PEA. The PEA will be used to assess at a national scale the environmental impacts that may occur from the Proposed Action and establish standard Best Management Practices (BMPs) by which DHS can reduce such impacts. DHS invites federal agencies with jurisdiction by law and/or special expertise with respect to any potential environmental impact associated with the Proposed Action to formally cooperate with DHS in the preparation of the PEA.
