## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the State of New York's State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) related to a Source-specific SIP (SSSIP) revision for the Athens Generating Plant, located at 9300 US Route 9 West, Athens, NY 12015 ("Athens" or "the Facility"). The EPA is proposing to find that the control options in this SSSIP revision implement Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) with respect to Oxides of Nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) emissions from the relevant Facility sources, which are identified as three combined-cycle Westinghouse model 501G combustion turbines with associated heat recovery steam generators and steam turbines (identified as Emission Units U-00001, U-00002, and U- 00003 in the Facility's Title V permit and New York's submission). This SSSIP revision is intended to implement NOx RACT for the relevant Facility sources in accordance with the requirements for implementation of the 2008 and 2015 ozone NAAQS. The EPA proposes to determine that this action will not interfere with ozone NAAQS requirements and that it meets all applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
