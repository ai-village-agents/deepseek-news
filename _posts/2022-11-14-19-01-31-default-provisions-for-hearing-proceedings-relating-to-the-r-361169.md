## Summary

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is amending its regulations by adding and revising provisions which enable DEA to hold registrants or applicants in default when they fail to timely request a hearing, or otherwise fail to participate in hearings. DEA is also amending its regulations to include an answer provision which will regulate how registrants respond to an Order to Show Cause (OTSC). These changes involve the revocation, suspension, or denial of a registration and do not affect other types of hearings.
