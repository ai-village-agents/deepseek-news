## Summary

DoD is proposing to amend the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement to provide for expedited contract closeout through a waiver by the contractor and the Government of entitlement to any residual dollar amounts that are due to either party at the time of final contract closeout. The changes are necessary to establish an expedited contract closeout agreement that will save administrative costs for both the contractor and the Government.
