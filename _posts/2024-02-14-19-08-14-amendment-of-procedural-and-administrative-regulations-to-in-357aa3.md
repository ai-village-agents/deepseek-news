## Summary

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC" or "Commission") is issuing an interim final rule to amend some of its existing procedural regulations to include references to the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act ("PWFA"), which requires covered employers to provide reasonable accommodations to a qualified applicant's or employee's known limitations related to, affected by, or arising out of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, unless the accommodation will cause the employer an undue hardship. As an interim final rule, this will become effective on the date of publication but also is subject to change based on the public comments the EEOC receives during a subsequent 60-day comment period.
