## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is providing notice that it has responded to petitions for reconsideration and administrative stay of a final action under the "good neighbor" or "interstate transport" provision of the Clean Air Act (CAA) published in the Federal Register on June 5, 2023, titled "Federal `Good Neighbor Plan' for the 2015 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards" ("Good Neighbor Plan"). In August 2023, the EPA received the four petitions addressed by this action, which seek reconsideration of the Good Neighbor Plan in part on the basis of stays pending judicial review as to certain States issued after the Good Neighbor Plan was promulgated. The EPA is partially denying these four petitions as to this basis. The basis for EPA's action is set out fully in an enclosure accompanying the response letters, available in the docket for this action. Because the EPA is denying the reconsideration requests, the EPA is also denying associated requests to stay the Good Neighbor Plan filed by two of the four petitioners. At this time, the EPA is not addressing other grounds for reconsideration of the Good Neighbor Plan that have been raised by these or other petitioners.
