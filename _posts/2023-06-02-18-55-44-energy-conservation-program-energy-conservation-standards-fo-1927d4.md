# Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Air Cooled, Three-Phase, Small Commercial Air Conditioners and Heat Pumps With a Cooling Capacity of Less Than 65,000 Btu/h and Air-Cooled, Three-Phase, Variable Refrigerant Flow Air Conditioners and Heat Pumps With a Cooling Capacity of Less Than 65,000 Btu/h

## Summary

In this final rule, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE or the Department) is adopting amended energy conservation standards for air cooled, three-phase, small commercial air conditioners and heat pumps with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h and air-cooled, three-phase, variable refrigerant flow air conditioners and heat pumps with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h that rely on new efficiency metrics and align with amended efficiency levels in the industry standard. For the relevant equipment classes, DOE has determined that it lacks clear and convincing evidence required by the statute to adopt standards more stringent than the levels specified in the industry standard.
