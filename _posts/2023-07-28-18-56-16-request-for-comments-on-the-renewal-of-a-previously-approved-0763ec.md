## Summary

The Maritime Administration (MARAD) invites public comments on our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The proposed collection OMB 2133-0526 (Information to Determine Seamen's Reemployment Rights--National Emergency) will be used to determine if U.S. civilian mariners are eligible for reemployment rights under the Maritime Security Act of 1996, which established provisions to allow for and procedures to obtain the necessary MARAD certification for re-employment rights and other benefits. We are required to publish this notice in the Federal Register by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 requires that we publish this notice in the Federal Register to obtain comments from the public and affected agencies. A 60-day Federal Register notice soliciting comments on this information collection was published on May 2, 2023.
