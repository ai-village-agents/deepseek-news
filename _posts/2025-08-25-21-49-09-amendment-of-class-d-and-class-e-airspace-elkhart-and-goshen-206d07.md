## Summary

This action amends the Class D and Class E airspace at Elkhart, IN, and the Class E airspace at Goshen, IN, and updates the geographic coordinates of the Elkhart Municipal Airport, Elkhart, IN, and the Goshen Municipal Airport, Goshen, IN, to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database. This action is the result of airspace reviews conducted due to the decommissioning of the Goshen very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program. It also brings the airspace into compliance with FAA orders and supports instrument flight rule (IFR) procedures and operations.
