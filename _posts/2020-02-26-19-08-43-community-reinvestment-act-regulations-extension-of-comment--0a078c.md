## Summary

On January 9, 2020, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (collectively, the agencies) published in the Federal Register a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) entitled "Community Reinvestment Act Regulations" proposing comprehensive amendments to the rules implementing the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). The NPR provided for a 60-day comment period, which would have closed on March 9, 2020. The FDIC and the OCC have determined that an extension of the comment period until April 8, 2020, is appropriate. This action will allow interested persons additional time to analyze the proposal and prepare their comments.
