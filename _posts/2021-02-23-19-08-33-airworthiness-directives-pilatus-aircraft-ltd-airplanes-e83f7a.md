## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Pilatus Aircraft Ltd. (Pilatus) Model PC-24 airplanes. This AD was prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as improperly manufactured cockpit and cabin evaporator filters installed during production on some PC-24 airplanes. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
