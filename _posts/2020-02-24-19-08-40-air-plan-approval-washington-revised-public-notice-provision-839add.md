## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving revisions to the general air quality regulations submitted by the Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology). The four categories of revisions to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) approved in this action are: revising the adoption by reference date for Federal regulations cross referenced in the State regulations; revising the definition of volatile organic compounds (VOC) to match changes to the Federal definition; updating public involvement procedures for the new source review air permitting program to reflect changes to the Federal requirements, allowing greater use of electronic notice and electronic access to information; and correcting typographical errors and minor wording changes for clarity.
