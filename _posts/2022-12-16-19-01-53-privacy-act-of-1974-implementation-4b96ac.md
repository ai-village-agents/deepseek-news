## Summary

The Department of Defense (DoD or Department) is giving concurrent notice of a new Department-wide system of records, "Declared Public Health Emergency Exposure Records," DoD-0013, and this rulemaking, which exempts portions of this system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, because of national security requirements. This rule is being published as a direct final rule as the Department does not expect to receive any adverse comments. If such comments are received, this direct final rule will be cancelled and a proposed rule for comments will be published.
