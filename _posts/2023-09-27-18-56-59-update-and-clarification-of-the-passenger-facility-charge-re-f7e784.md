## Summary

The FAA proposes to amend its Passenger Facility Charge regulations to implement changes to an existing pilot program that resides within the Passenger Facility Charge program. This Congressionally mandated pilot program simplifies the process for public agencies controlling commercial service airports to obtain FAA authority to impose and use Passenger Facility Charges to fund airport development projects. The FAA also proposes to reaffirm existing program requirements and update or remove obsolete references within the Passenger Facility Charge regulations. Further, this proposed action removes certain Passenger Facility Charge program requirements eliminated in the 2018 FAA reauthorization legislation.
