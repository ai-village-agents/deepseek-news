# Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 767-200, -300, -300F, and -400ER series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by discovery of a crack at one of the forward lower fastener holes, outside of the underwing longeron (UWL) following replacement of a cracked UWL fitting. This proposed AD would require performing an open hole high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspection for cracks of the fastener holes common to the UWL fitting, upper drag splice angle, and lower drag splice angle, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
