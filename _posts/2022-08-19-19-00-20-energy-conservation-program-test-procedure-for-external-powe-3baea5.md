# Energy Conservation Program: Test Procedure for External Power Supplies

## Summary

This final rule amends the current U.S. Department of Energy test procedure for external power supplies by clarifying the scope of the test procedure more explicitly, providing more specific instructions for testing single-voltage external power supplies with multiple-output busses and external power supplies shipped without an output cord, providing instructions allowing for functionality unrelated to the external power supply circuit to be disconnected during testing so long as the disconnection does not impact the functionality of the external power supply itself, specifying test requirements for adaptive external power supplies that conform to the industry-based Universal Serial Bus Power Delivery specifications consistent with current test procedure waivers that DOE has already granted for these products, and reorganizing the test procedure to centralize definitions, consolidate generally applicable requirements, and better delineate requirements for single-voltage, multiple-voltage, and adaptive external power supplies.
