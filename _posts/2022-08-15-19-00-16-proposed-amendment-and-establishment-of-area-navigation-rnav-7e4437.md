## Summary

This action proposes to amend five area navigation (RNAV) routes (T-224, T-314, T-315, T-325, and Q-68), and establish two RNAV routes (T-303, and T-360). These routes would support the FAA VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program, and would expand the availability of RNAV routing in the National Airspace System (NAS).
