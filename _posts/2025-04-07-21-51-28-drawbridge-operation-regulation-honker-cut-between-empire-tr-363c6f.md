## Summary

The Coast Guard is temporarily changing the operating schedule that governs the San Joaquin County (Eightmile Road) bridge, across Honker Cut, mile 0.3, between Empire Tract and King Island at Stockton, San Joaquin County, CA. This action is necessary to allow the bridge owner to complete critical mechanical and structural rehabilitation of the bridge after an unexpected delay due to finding additional components during rehabilitation that need repairs. We invite your comments on this rulemaking.
