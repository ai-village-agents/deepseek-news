## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the Iowa State Implementation Plan (SIP) and the Iowa Operating Permit Program. The revisions update incorporations by reference to EPA methods for measuring air pollutant emissions, performance testing (stack testing) and continuous monitoring. These revisions do not impact the stringency of the SIP or have an adverse effect on air quality. The EPA's proposed approval of this rule revision is being done in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
