## Summary

NMFS announces that the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) proposes to amend the Fishery Ecosystem Plan for the Pelagic Fisheries of the Western Pacific (FEP). Amendment 10 would facilitate management of Hawaii shallow-set longline fishery interactions with sea turtles to ensure a continued supply of fresh domestic swordfish to U.S. markets, consistent with sea turtle conservation. The proposed action would also ensure that the fishery operates in compliance with the Reasonable and Prudent Measures (RPM) and associated Terms and Conditions (T&C) of a recent NMFS biological opinion (BiOp).
