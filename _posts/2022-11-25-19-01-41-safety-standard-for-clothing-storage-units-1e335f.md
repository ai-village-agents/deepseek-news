## Summary

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission or CPSC) has determined that there is an unreasonable risk of injury and death, particularly to children, associated with clothing storage units (CSUs) tipping over. To address this risk, the Commission is issuing a rule regarding the stability of CSUs. This rule requires CSUs to be tested for stability, exceed minimum stability requirements, bear labels containing safety and identification information, and display a hang tag providing performance and technical data about the stability of the CSU. The Commission issues this rule under the authority of the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA).
