## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-19- 08, which applied to certain Robinson Helicopter Company (Robinson) Model R44 and R44 II helicopters. AD 2021-19-08 required checking each tail rotor blade (blade) for any crack and removing any cracked blade from service. AD 2021-19-08 also required removing all affected blades from service and prohibited installing any affected blade on any helicopter. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-19-08, it was determined that an additional model helicopter and additional blades are affected by the unsafe condition. This AD requires the same actions as AD 2021-19- 08 and adds certain Robinson Model R66 helicopters to the applicability and adds additional part-numbered and serial-numbered blades to the applicability. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
