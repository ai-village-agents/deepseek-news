## Summary

In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), this notice announces that the Information Collection Request (ICR) abstracted below will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected burden. This is a request for approval for reinstatement of a previously-approved collection of information for NHTSA's Highway Grant Program, which includes State Highway Safety Program grants, the National Priority Safety Program grants, and a separate grant on racial profiling data collection. The purpose of the information collection is to collect information necessary for NHTSA to issue grants to States. To receive grants, a State must submit a Highway Safety Plan (HSP) that supports its qualifications for receiving grant funds. Specifically, the HSP consists of information on the highway safety planning process, performance report, performance plan, problem identification, highway safety countermeasure strategies, planned activities and funding amounts, certifications and assurances, and application materials that cover Section 405 grants and the reauthorized Section 1906 grant. A Federal Register Notice with a 60- day comment period soliciting comments on the following information collection was published on February 9, 2021. NHTSA received three comments. A summary of the comments and NHTSA's response to those comments is provided below.
