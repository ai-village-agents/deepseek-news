## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a security zone for certain waters of the Delaware River. This action is necessary to provide protection of Very Important Persons (VIPs) while attending the Democratic National Caucus (DNC) on the Delaware River in the vicinity of Penns Landing located in Philadelphia, PA. This security zone will be enforced intermittently and only for the protection of VIPs when in the area and will restrict vessel traffic while the zones are being enforced. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the security zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Delaware Bay or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
