The Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation (OPRE) within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is proposing an extension to the data collection activities conducted for the Next Generation of Enhanced Employment Strategies (NextGen) Project (Office of Management and Budget (OMB) #0970-0545). The project is rigorously evaluating innovative interventions to promote employment and economic security among low-income individuals with complex challenges.

This extension will allow additional time to conduct study intake, collect data from NextGen programs and staff, and conduct participant data collections. No changes are proposed to the data collection instruments.
