## Summary

The Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission or CPSC) is announcing the availability of a proposed Scientific Integrity Policy. This policy is provided in response to the Presidential Memorandum on Restoring Trust in Government Through Scientific Integrity and Evidence-Based Policymaking, to ensure that Agency stakeholders are given an opportunity to comment on this policy. Scientific and technical work constitute the foundation upon which the CPSC executes the agency's mission to protect the public against unreasonable risks of injury associated with the use of consumer products. CPSC aims to carry out the agency's mission with integrity, because both policy makers and the public rely upon the work done at the CPSC to ensure the protection of consumers from potential hazards associated with consumer products.
