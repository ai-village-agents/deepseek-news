## Summary

The Department of Energy (Department or DOE) announces the availability of a limited change to DOE Manual 435.1-1, Radioactive Waste Management Manual, to formally incorporate the Department's interpretation of the statutory definition of high-level radioactive waste (HLW). In support of that effort, DOE made an administrative change to DOE Order 435.1, Radioactive Waste Management. The HLW interpretation was described in the Supplemental Notice Concerning U.S. Department of Energy Interpretation of High-Level Radioactive Waste, published in the Federal Register on June 10, 2019 (Supplemental Notice). The revised Manual includes DOE's interpretation of the statutory term HLW as defined in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (AEA), and the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended (NWPA).
