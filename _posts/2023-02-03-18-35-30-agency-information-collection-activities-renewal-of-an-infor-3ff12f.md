## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FMCSA announces its plan to submit the information collection request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval. FMCSA requests approval to renew an ICR titled, "Transportation of Hazardous Materials, Highway Routing."

FMCSA did not receive any comments in response to the 60- day Federal Register Notice published on September 8, 2022.
