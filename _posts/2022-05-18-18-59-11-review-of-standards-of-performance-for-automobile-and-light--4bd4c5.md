## Summary

This proposal presents the preliminary results of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) review of the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for Automobile and Light Duty Truck Surface Coating Operations as required by the Clean Air Act (CAA). The EPA is proposing, in a new NSPS subpart, revised volatile organic compound (VOC) emission limits for prime coat, guide coat, and topcoat operations for affected facilities that commence construction, modification or reconstruction after May 18, 2022. In addition, the EPA is proposing amendments under the new NSPS subpart: Revision of the plastic parts provision; updates to the control devices and control device testing and monitoring requirements; revision of the transfer efficiency provisions; revision of the recordkeeping and reporting requirements, the addition of work practices to minimize VOC emissions; the addition of electronic reporting; clarification of the requirements for periods of startup, shutdown and malfunction; and other amendments to harmonize the new NSPS subpart and Automobile and Light Duty Truck Surface Coating National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) requirements. The EPA is also proposing to amend NSPS subpart MM to apply to sources that commence construction, reconstruction, or modification after October 5, 1979, and on or before May 18, 2022 and to add electronic reporting requirements.
