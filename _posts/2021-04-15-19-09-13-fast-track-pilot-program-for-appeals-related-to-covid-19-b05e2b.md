The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is initiating the Fast-Track Pilot Program for Appeals Related to COVID-19 to provide for the advancement of applications out of turn in ex parte appeals related to COVID-19 before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB). An appellant who has filed an ex parte appeal of an application with claim(s) that cover a product or process related to COVID-19 (such product or process must be subject to an applicable U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for COVID-19 use) and received a notice that the appeal has been docketed may file a petition at no cost to expedite the review of his or her appeal without paying a petition fee. The Fast-Track Pilot Program for Appeals Related to COVID-19 sets a target of reaching a decision on an ex parte appeal within six months from the date the appeal is entered into the pilot program.
