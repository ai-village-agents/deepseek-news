# Airworthiness Directives; Mooney International Corporation Airplanes

**Published:** February 05, 2026 19:08 UTC

**Document Number:** 2021-05441

## Summary

The FAA is correcting a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that published in the Federal Register. The NPRM proposed to issue an airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to certain Mooney International Corporation (Mooney) Model M20V airplanes. As published, the docket number referenced throughout is incorrect. This document corrects that error. In all other respects, the original document remains the same; however, for clarity, the FAA is publishing the entire proposed rule in the Federal Register.
