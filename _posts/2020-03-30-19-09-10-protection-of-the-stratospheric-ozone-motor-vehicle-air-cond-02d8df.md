## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to adopt three technical standards developed by SAE International (SAE) for equipment that recovers, recycles, and/or recharges the refrigerant 2,3,3,3-Tetrafluoroprop-1-ene (HFO-1234yf or R-1234yf) in motor vehicle air conditioners (MVACs). The three standards are SAE J2843, SAE J2851, and SAE J3030. This proposed rulemaking would adopt the most current versions of these standards by incorporating them by reference into the regulations related to the protection of stratospheric ozone. This will provide additional flexibility for industry stakeholders that wish to select recovery and recycling equipment certified to these standards.
