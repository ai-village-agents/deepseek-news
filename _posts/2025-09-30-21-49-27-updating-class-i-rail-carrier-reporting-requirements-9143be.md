## Summary

The Board proposes to terminate Class I carriers' supplemental reporting of certain Positive Train Control (PTC) expenditures and to require Class I carriers to report two service metrics on a weekly basis. Because PTC is now fully implemented, the Board proposes deregulatory action to end this reporting. With respect to service- related reporting, the Board proposes to require Class I carriers to report metrics that would advance the Board's objective of ensuring rail service reliability.
