## Summary

We, NMFS, announce a 90-day finding on a petition to revise the critical habitat designation for the North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). In April 2008, we issued a final rule designating approximately 3,050 square kilometers (~1,175 square miles) and approximately 91,850 square kilometers (~35,460 square miles) of critical habitat for North Pacific right whales in the Gulf of Alaska and the Southeast Bering Sea, respectively. The petition requests we revise this critical habitat. We find that the petition presents substantial scientific information indicating the petitioned action may be warranted. We are hereby initiating a review of the currently designated critical habitat to determine whether revision is warranted. To ensure a comprehensive review, we are soliciting scientific and commercial information pertaining to this action.
