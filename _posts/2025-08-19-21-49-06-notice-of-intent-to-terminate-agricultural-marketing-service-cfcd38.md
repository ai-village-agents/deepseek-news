## Summary

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) proposes to terminate the master scale testing program effective September 30, 2025. Significantly reduced customer usage has led to insufficient collection of user fees that are required to cover program costs. AMS seeks public comment on this service termination from affected parties.
