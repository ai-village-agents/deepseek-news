## Summary

On January 12, 2022, we published in the Federal Register a notice inviting applications (NIA) for new awards for fiscal year (FY) 2022 for the Alaska Native Education (ANE) program, Assistance Listing Number (ALN) 84.356A. Since that time, Congress passed, and the President signed, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022 (the Act), which provides funding for the awards under this competition. We are amending the NIA to provide, consistent with the Act, that the administrative cost cap in section 6205(b) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) applies only to direct administrative costs for grants awarded using FY 2022 appropriations and to clarify that funds may be used for construction. This notice relates to the approved information collection under OMB control number 1894-0006.
