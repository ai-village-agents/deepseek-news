# Request for Comments on Draft FIPS-203, Draft FIPS-204, and Draft FIPS-205

**Document Number:** 2023-18197

## Summary

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requests comments on three draft Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS): FIPS 203, Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism Standard, FIPS 204, Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Standard, and FIPS 205, Stateless Hash-based Digital Signature Standard. These proposed standards specify key establishment and digital signature schemes that are designed to resist future attacks by quantum computers, which threaten the security of current standards. The three algorithms specified in these standards are each derived from different submissions in the NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization project (see: https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post- quantum-cryptography/post-quantum-cryptography-standardization).
