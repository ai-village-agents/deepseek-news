## Summary

The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) amends the organic livestock and poultry production requirements by adding new provisions for livestock handling and transport, slaughter, and avian (poultry) living conditions; and expanding and clarifying existing requirements covering livestock care and production practices and non-avian living conditions. These changes will ensure organically produced foods meet a transparent and consistent standard to allow the industry to maintain consumer confidence in USDA organic products, to align with consumer expectations regarding outdoor access, and to further facilitate interstate commerce in organic products.
