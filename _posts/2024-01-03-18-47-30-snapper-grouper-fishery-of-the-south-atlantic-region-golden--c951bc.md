## Summary

NMFS issues regulations to implement amendments to the Fishery Management Plans (FMPs) for the Snapper-Grouper Fishery, the Golden Crab Fishery, and the Dolphin and Wahoo Fishery, referenced here as the Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC) Control Rule Amendments. This final rule modifies the ABC control rules, allows the phase-in of subsequent ABC changes, allows some carry-over of an unharvested portion of the annual catch limit (ACL) to the following fishing year, and modifies the FMP framework procedures to implement carry-overs of ACLs when appropriate. NMFS also implements an administrative clarification to existing regulations for the Snapper-Grouper FMP framework procedure. The purpose of this final rule is to ensure catch level recommendations are based on the best scientific information available, prevent overfishing while achieving optimum yield, and increase flexibility in setting catch limits.
