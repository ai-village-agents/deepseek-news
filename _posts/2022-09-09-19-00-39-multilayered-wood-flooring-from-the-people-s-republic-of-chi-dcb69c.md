## Summary

On July 29, 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) published the preliminary results of the changed circumstances review (CCR) of the antidumping duty (AD) order on multilayered wood flooring (MLWF) from the People's Republic of China (China). Commerce preliminarily determined that MLWF that is produced and exported by Zhejiang Yuhua Timber Co. Ltd. (Yuhua) and sold through A-Timber Flooring Company Limited (A-Timber) is excluded from the AD order. For these final results, Commerce continues to find that MLWF sold through A-Timber that is produced and exported by Yuhua is excluded from the AD order.
