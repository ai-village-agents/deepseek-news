## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Cameron Balloons Ltd. (Cameron) fuel cylinders installed on hot air balloons. This AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as quick shut-off (QSO) flanged adaptors manufactured with non-conforming (undersized) threads. This AD immediately requires either replacing the QSO flange adapter or inspecting the fuel cylinder for leakage and taking corrective action, and replacing the QSO flange adapter within 4 months. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
