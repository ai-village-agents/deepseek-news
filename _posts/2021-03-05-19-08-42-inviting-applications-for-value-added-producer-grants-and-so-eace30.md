## Summary

The Rural Business-Cooperative Service (Agency) published a notice in the Federal Register on December 21, 2020 inviting applications for the Value-Added Producer Grant (VAPG) program. Subsequently, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, which provides $35 million in COVID-19 relief funds, was enacted. Accordingly, a total of $76 million in program funding is available. The agency is extending the application deadline, increasing available total funding for the program; allowing for application submission through email; eliminating the awarding of points for the Level of Commitment category specified in Section 1(c) of the original notice, and allowing for a reduced cost share match of 10 percent of the grant amount for the $35 million in COVID-19 relief funds. You should review this notice in its entirety for more specific information on changes that have been made to the original notice.
