## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) proposes to modify or eliminate certain provisions of its Video Relay Service (VRS) rules. Specifically, the Commission proposes to: increase from 50% to 80% the portion of a VRS provider's monthly minutes that may be handled by Communications Assistants (CAs) working from home; reduce or eliminate the three-year experience rule for CAs working from home, and allow VRS providers to use contract CAs for 30% of the providers' monthly call minutes; and allow Telecommunications Relay Services (TRS) Fund compensation of calls placed by registered VRS users to the United States from outside the country, for up to one year after leaving the country, as long as they notify their provider of such travel at any time before placing the first such call. The Commission also requests comment on whether any other at-home VRS rules should be modified.
