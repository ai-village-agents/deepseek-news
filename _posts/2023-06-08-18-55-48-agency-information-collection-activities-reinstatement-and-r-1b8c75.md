## Summary

The U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) is seeking to reinstate and revise a previously approved information collection in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995. The Information Collection Request (ICR) will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) pursuant to the PRA for review and clearance. This information collection, entitled, "Generic Clearance Request for Voluntary Customer Surveys," OMB Control No. 3124-0012, is part of MSPB's efforts to improve customer service delivery. The information collection instruments consist of short customer-focused surveys distributed through Qualtrics, MSPB's survey platform. MSPB is requesting public comments. The purpose of this notice is to allow 30 days for public comment after submission of the collection to OMB.
