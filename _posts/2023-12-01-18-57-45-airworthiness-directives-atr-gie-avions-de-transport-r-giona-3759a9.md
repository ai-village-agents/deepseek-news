## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain ATR--GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42-500 and ATR72-212A airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of loose fasteners and cracks in the horizontal stabilizer (HS) left- and right- hand leading edge lateral ribs, the box in between, the center box upper panel, and HS forward back-up fitting. This AD requires an inspection of the HS affected areas for discrepancies and applicable corrective action, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
