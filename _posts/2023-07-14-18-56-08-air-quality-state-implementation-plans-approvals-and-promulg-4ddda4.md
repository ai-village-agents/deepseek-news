## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve portions of state implementation plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of California to meet Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act") requirements for the 1997 annual fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or "standards") in the San Joaquin Valley PM<INF>2.5</INF> nonattainment area. Specifically, the EPA is proposing to approve those portions of the submitted SIP revisions as they pertain to the Serious nonattainment area and CAA section 189(d) requirements for the 1997 annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS, except for the requirement for contingency measures. In addition, the EPA is proposing to approve 2020 and 2023 motor vehicle emissions budgets and the trading mechanism for use in transportation conformity analyses for the 1997 annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS. The EPA will accept comments on this proposed rule during a 30-day public comment period.
