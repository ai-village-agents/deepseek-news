## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) implements section 12 of the TRACED Act in order to enable voice service providers to block calls from numbers associated with a type of illegal robocall known as a one-ring scam. The Commission also, pursuant to the TRACED Act, expands collaborative law enforcement and consumer education activities to stop one-ring scams and other fraudulent and abusive robocalling practices. The measures adopted by the Commission empower voice service providers to stop these illegal robocalls and will give consumers substantial additional protection from these scams.
