## Summary

The Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (the Commission) is adopting revised rules as final rules implementing the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in light of the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, its experience under the rules, the need to update its fee schedule, and the need to update and clarify a number of its FOIA procedures. These revised rules will ensure rapid and effective procedures for requesting information and processing requests under the FOIA. The Commission published a notice of proposed rulemaking that permitted public comment on the rules. The Commission has determined that it will make two changes to its proposed rules in light of comments received and that it will adopt those rules as final.
