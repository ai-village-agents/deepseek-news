## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce the receipt of an application from California Department of Parks and Recreation (CDPR; applicant) for an incidental take permit (ITP) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The applicant requests the ITP to take federally listed species incidental to lawful activities at Pismo State Beach and Oceano Dunes State Vehicular Recreation Area, San Luis Obispo County, California. The activities are described in the draft habitat conservation plan (HCP) and associated draft environmental assessment (EA) for CDPR activities. The CDPR developed the draft HCP as part of their application for an ITP. The Service prepared a draft EA in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to evaluate the potential effects to the natural and human environment resulting from issuing an ITP to CDPR. We are providing notice that the draft HCP and draft EA are both available for public review. We invite comment on these documents from the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies.
