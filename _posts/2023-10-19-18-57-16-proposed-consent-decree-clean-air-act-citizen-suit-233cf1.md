## Summary

In accordance with the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA or the Act), notice is given of a proposed consent decree in Center for Biological Diversity v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, et al., No. 2:23-cv-01843 (E.D. Pa.). On May 16, 2023, Plaintiff Center for Biological Diversity filed a complaint in the Unites States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Plaintiff alleged that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) has unreasonably delayed taking action following the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit's September 3, 2021, order in Case No. 21-1279. That order granted EPA's request to remand to EPA for reconsideration a final rule titled "Air Plan Approval; Pennsylvania; Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) for Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) Under the 2008 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)," published in the Federal Register on December 14, 2020). The proposed consent decree would establish a deadline for EPA to complete its reconsideration of that final rule.
