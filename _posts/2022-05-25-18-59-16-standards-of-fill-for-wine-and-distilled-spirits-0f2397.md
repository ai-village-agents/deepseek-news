## Summary

In this document, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to amend the regulations governing wine and distilled spirits containers. TTB is proposing to add 10 additional authorized standards of fill for wine, along with related technical and other harmonizing changes. TTB also is considering, as an alternative, eliminating all but a minimum standard of fill for wine containers and all but a minimum and maximum for distilled spirits containers, thus potentially eliminating unnecessary regulatory requirements, reducing barriers to competition, and providing consumers broader purchasing options.
