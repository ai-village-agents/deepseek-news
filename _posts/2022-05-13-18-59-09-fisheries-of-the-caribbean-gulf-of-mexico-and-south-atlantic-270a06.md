## Summary

Through this temporary rule, NMFS implements accountability measures (AMs) for the red snapper recreational sector private angling component in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) off Louisiana and Florida for the 2022 fishing year. Based on information provided by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) and Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC), NMFS has determined that the 2021 regional management area private angling component annual catch limits (ACL) for Gulf red snapper were exceeded for both Louisiana and Florida. Therefore, NMFS reduces the 2022 private angling component ACLs of Gulf red snapper for both the Louisiana and Florida regional management areas. This reduction will remain in effect through the remainder of the current fishing year on December 31, 2022, and is necessary to protect the Gulf red snapper resource.
