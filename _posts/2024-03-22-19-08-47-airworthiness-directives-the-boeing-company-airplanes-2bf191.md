## Summary

The FAA is withdrawing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) that would have applied to certain The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787- 10 airplanes. The NPRM was prompted by a report indicating that during regular pre-flight checks, multiple door assist handles failed by pulling loose from their lower attachment point in the doorway support bracket. The NPRM would have required, depending on airplane configuration, inspecting the forward and aft door assist handles for correct installation, installing a new retainer above the lower keyway of the support bracket assembly at certain locations, installing a placard on certain support bracket assemblies, re-identifying the support bracket assembly, and replacing the upper spring clip. Since issuance of the NPRM, the FAA has determined that the intended corrective actions do not address the unsafe condition. Accordingly, the NPRM is withdrawn.
