## Summary

The Secretary of the Interior proposes to extend the duration of the withdrawal created by an Executive Order as modified by Public Land Order (PLO) No. 6458 and extended by PLO No. 7581 for an additional 20-year term. The E.O. as modified and extended withdrew 117.13 acres of public land from all forms of appropriation under the public-land laws, including the mining laws, but not from mineral leasing, for the Sitka Magnetic Observatory site, and reserved the site for use by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) as a magnetic and seismological observation in Sitka, Alaska. This notice announces to the public an opportunity to comment on the proposal and request a public meeting for the 20-year withdrawal extension.
