## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking interim final action to stay, for emissions sources in Alabama, Minnesota, Nevada, Oklahoma, Utah, and West Virginia only, the effectiveness of the Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) requirements established to address the obligations of these and other States to mitigate interstate air pollution with respect to the 2015 national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for ozone (the Good Neighbor Plan). The EPA is also revising certain other regulations to ensure the continued implementation of previously established requirements to mitigate interstate air pollution with respect to other ozone NAAQS while the Good Neighbor Plan's requirements are stayed. The stay and the associated revisions to other regulations are being issued in response to judicial orders that partially stay, pending judicial review, a separate EPA action which disapproved certain State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted by these and other States.
