## Summary

The Department of Labor (the Department) is soliciting comments concerning a proposed revision of the information collection request (ICR) titled "Report of Construction Contractor's Wage Rates," which describes the WD-10 form and its use in wage surveys to implement the prevailing wage requirements of the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts. The Department is proposing to revise the WD-10 form and create a new WD-10A pre-survey form that will be used to identify potential respondents to the WD-10. This comment request is part of continuing Departmental efforts to reduce paperwork and respondent burden in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA). The PRA process helps to ensure that requested data can be provided in the desired format, reporting burden (time and financial resources) is minimized, collection instruments are clearly understood, and the impact of collection requirements on respondents can be properly assessed. A copy of the proposed information collection request can be obtained by contacting the office listed below in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section of this Notice.
