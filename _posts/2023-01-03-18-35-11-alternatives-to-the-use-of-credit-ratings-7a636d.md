## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its regulations for approved financial assurance mechanisms for decommissioning, specifically for parent and self-company guarantees that require bond ratings issued by credit rating agencies. This proposed rule would implement the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 that directed agencies to amend their regulations to remove any reference to or requirement of reliance on credit ratings. This proposed rule affects applicants and licensees who are required to provide decommissioning financial assurance. The NRC invites public comment on this proposed rule and associated draft guidance, and will hold a public meeting to promote full understanding of the contemplated action and facilitate public comment.
