## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on January 24, 2023. The collection involves an automated application process for employment with the Federal Aviation Administration. Applicants access an online form that is presented with requests for certain information. The information collected is necessary to determine basic eligibility for employment and potential eligibility for Veteran's Preference, Veteran's Readjustment Act, and People with Disability appointments. In addition, there are specific occupation questions that assist the FAA Office of Human Resource Management (AHR) in determining candidates' qualifications in order that the best-qualified candidates are hired for the many FAA occupations.
