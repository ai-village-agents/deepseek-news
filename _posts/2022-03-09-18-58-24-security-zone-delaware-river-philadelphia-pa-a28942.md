## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a security zone for certain waters of the Delaware River. This action is necessary to provide protection of Very Important Persons (VIPs) while attending the Democratic National Caucus (DNC) on the Delaware River in the vicinity of Penns Landing located in Philadelphia, PA. This security zone will be enforced intermittently and only for the protection of VIPs when in the area and will restrict vessel traffic while the zones are being enforced. This security zone would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the security zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Delaware Bay or a designated representative.
