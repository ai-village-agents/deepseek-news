## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is requesting comment on an application from General Motors Corporation LLC (GM) for off-cycle carbon dioxide (CO<INF>2</INF>) credits under EPA's light- duty vehicle greenhouse gas emissions standards. "Off-cycle" emission reductions can be achieved by employing technologies that result in real-world benefits, but where that benefit is not adequately captured on the test procedures used by manufacturers to demonstrate compliance with emission standards. EPA's light-duty vehicle greenhouse gas program acknowledges these benefits by giving automobile manufacturers several options for generating "off-cycle" CO<INF>2</INF> credits. Under the regulations, a manufacturer may apply for CO<INF>2</INF> credits for off-cycle technologies that result in off-cycle benefits. In these cases, a manufacturer must provide EPA with a proposed methodology for determining the real-world off-cycle benefit. GM has submitted an application that describes a methodology for determining off-cycle credits from technologies described in their application. Pursuant to applicable regulations, EPA is making this off-cycle credit calculation methodology available for public comment.
