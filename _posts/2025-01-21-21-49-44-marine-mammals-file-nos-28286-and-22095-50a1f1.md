## Summary

Notice is hereby given that the National Marine Fisheries Service is extending the public comment period associated with the notice of receipt for an application for a permit (File No. 28286) to conduct research and enhancement activities on one stranded, non- releasable beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) from the endangered Cook Inlet distinct population segment (DPS). The application has been updated to reflect additional information received from the applicant. Additionally, we propose extending SeaWorld's current permit, No. 22095-01, under which the subject beluga whale is currently held, for six months to allow additional processing of the updated application (File No. 28286).
