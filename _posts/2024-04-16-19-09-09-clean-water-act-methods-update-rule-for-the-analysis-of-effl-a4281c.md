## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing changes to its test procedures required to be used by industries and municipalities when analyzing the chemical, physical, and biological properties of wastewater and other samples for reporting under the EPA's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit program. The Clean Water Act requires the EPA to promulgate these test procedures (analytical methods) for analysis of pollutants. The EPA anticipates that these changes will provide increased flexibility for the regulated community in meeting monitoring requirements while improving data quality. In addition, this update to the CWA methods will incorporate technological advances in analytical technology and make a series of minor changes and corrections to existing approved methods. As such, the EPA expects that these changes will not result in any negative economic impacts.
