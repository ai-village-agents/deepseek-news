## Summary

This final rule updates procedures governing the BLM's renewable energy and right-of-way programs, focusing on two main topics. The first topic is solar and wind energy generation rents and fees, implementing new authority from the Energy Act of 2020 to "reduce acreage rental rates and capacity fees, or both, for existing and new wind and solar authorizations" and making certain findings required by the statute. The second topic is expanding agency discretion to process applications for solar and wind energy generation rights-of-way inside designated leasing areas (DLAs). In addition to these two main topics, this final rule makes technical changes, corrections, and clarifications to the regulations. This final rule will update the BLM's procedures governing the BLM's administration of rights-of-way issued under Title V of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA), including for solar and wind energy applications and development authorizations.
