## Summary

This final rule establishes two new Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) specifying performance requirements for all motor vehicles that use hydrogen as a fuel source. The final rule is based on Global Technical Regulation (GTR) No. 13, Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Vehicles. FMVSS No. 307, "Fuel system integrity of hydrogen vehicles," specifies requirements for the integrity of the fuel system in hydrogen vehicles during normal vehicle operations and after crashes. FMVSS No. 308, "Compressed hydrogen storage system integrity," specifies requirements for the compressed hydrogen storage system to ensure the safe storage of hydrogen onboard vehicles. These two standards will reduce deaths and injuries from fires due to hydrogen fuel leakages and/or explosion of the hydrogen storage system.
