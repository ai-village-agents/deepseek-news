## Summary

The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) invites comments on a proposal to implement a standardized formula model for calculating Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) supervision fees. The proposed change would enable FGIS to adjust supervision fees annually in order to maintain an appropriate operating reserve as required by the United States Grain Standards Act (USGSA). As with other AMS fee-based programs, AMS would publish annual FGIS fee updates in the Federal Register and post updated fee schedules on its website. The proposed rule would also eliminate or revise certain registration and duplication fees charged by FGIS.
