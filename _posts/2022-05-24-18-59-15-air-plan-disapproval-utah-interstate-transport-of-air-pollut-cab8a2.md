## Summary

Pursuant to the federal Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to disapprove the State Implementation Plan (SIP) submittal from Utah regarding interstate transport for the 2015 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS). The "good neighbor" or "interstate transport" provision requires that each state's SIP contain adequate provisions to prohibit emissions from within the state from significantly contributing to nonattainment or interfering with maintenance of the NAAQS in other states. This requirement is part of the broader set of "infrastructure" requirements, which are designed to ensure that the structural components of each state's air quality management program are adequate to meet the state's responsibilities under the CAA. If the EPA finalizes this disapproval, the EPA will continue to be subject to an obligation to promulgate a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) to address the relevant interstate transport requirements, which was triggered by a finding of failure to submit issued in December of 2019. Disapproval does not start a mandatory CAA sanctions clock.
