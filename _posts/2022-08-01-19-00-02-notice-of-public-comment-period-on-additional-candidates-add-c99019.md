## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing a 15-day public comment period on two (2) additional peer review candidates for the external peer review of the Biofuels and the Environment: Third Triennial Report to Congress (RtC3). EPA previously invited public comment on an initial pool of twenty (20) candidates announced in a Federal Register Notice (FRN) published on May 9, 2022. After considering public comments and the balance and collective expertise of the reviewers, EPA asked ERG, the independent contractor organizing the peer review, to identify additional candidates to strengthen expertise gaps and allow a more balanced panel. EPA is seeking public comment on additional peer review candidates in order to strengthen underrepresented areas of expertise, specifically economics, water quality, and ecology disciplines. You may also comment on the initial twenty (20) candidates if you have not yet done so. If you already commented on those initial candidates in response to the May 9, 2022, FRN, you do not need to resubmit those comments. After considering all public comments on the initial pool of 20 candidates and the additional candidates announced in this FRN, ERG will select up to nine (9) peer reviewers. ERG will ensure the peer reviewers' combined expertise best spans the following disciplines: economics, engineering, agronomics, land use change, remote sensing, air quality, biogeochemistry, water quality, hydrology, conservation biology, limnology, and ecology. The peer review will be conducted under the framework of EPA's Scientific Integrity Policy (https://www.epa.gov/ sites/default/files/2014-02/documents/ scientific_integrity_policy_2012.pdf) and follow procedures established in EPA's Peer Review Handbook 4th Edition, 2015 (EPA/100/B-15/001).
