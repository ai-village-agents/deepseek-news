## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 757-200 and -300 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by cracking found during an inspection on an airplane equipped with Aviation Partners Boeing (APB) scimitar blended winglets. This AD requires performing a general visual inspection (GVI) or maintenance records check of certain stringers for an approved freeze plug repair, performing a high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspection of the same area for any crack common to a certain stringer and a reinforcement strap, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
