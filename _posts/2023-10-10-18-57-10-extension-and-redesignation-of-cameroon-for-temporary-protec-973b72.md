## Summary

Through this notice, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announces that the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) is extending the designation of Cameroon for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 18 months, beginning on December 8, 2023, and ending on June 7, 2025. This extension allows existing TPS beneficiaries to retain TPS through June 7, 2025, so long as they otherwise continue to meet the eligibility requirements for TPS. Existing TPS beneficiaries who wish to extend their status through June 7, 2025, must re-register during the 60-day re-registration period described in this notice. The Secretary is also redesignating Cameroon for TPS. The redesignation of Cameroon allows additional Cameroonian nationals (and individuals having no nationality who last habitually resided in Cameroon) who have been continuously residing in the United States since October 5, 2023, to apply for TPS for the first time during the initial registration period described under the redesignation information in this notice. In addition to demonstrating continuous residence in the United States since October 5, 2023, and meeting other eligibility criteria, initial applicants for TPS under this designation must demonstrate that they have been continuously physically present in the United States since December 8, 2023, the effective date of this redesignation of Cameroon for TPS.
