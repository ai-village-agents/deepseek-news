## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce the receipt of an application from G3 enterprises (applicant) for an incidental take permit (ITP) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).The applicant requests an ITP to take the San Joaquin kit fox, the Central Valley distinct population segment of the California tiger salamander, the California red-legged frog, and the vernal pool fairy shrimp, incidental to the construction of the Byron Sand Mine Evo East Quarry Expansion Project in Contra Costa County, California. We request public comment on the application, which includes the applicant's proposed habitat conservation plan (HCP), and on the Service's preliminary determination that the proposed permitting action may be eligible for a categorical exclusion pursuant to the Council on Environmental Quality's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations, the Department of the Interior's (DOI) NEPA regulations, and the DOI Departmental Manual. To make this preliminary determination, we prepared a draft environmental action statement and low-effect screening form, both of which are also available for public review. We invite comment from the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies. Before issuing the requested permit, we will take into consideration any information that we receive during the public comment period.
