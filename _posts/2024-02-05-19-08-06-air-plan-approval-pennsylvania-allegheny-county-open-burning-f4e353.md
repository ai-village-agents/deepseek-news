## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) on behalf of the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD). The SIP submission requests EPA to incorporate into the Pennsylvania SIP particulate matter emission mitigation requirements for industry operating in the portion of Allegheny County known as the "Mon Valley" during weather- related pollution episodes. It also amends a portion of Allegheny County's open burning regulation, which was previously incorporated into Pennsylvania's SIP. This action is being taken under the Clean Air Act (CAA).
