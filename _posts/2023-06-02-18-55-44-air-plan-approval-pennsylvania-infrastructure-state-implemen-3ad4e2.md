## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Whenever EPA promulgates a new or revised national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS or standard), the Clean Air Act (CAA) requires states to make SIP submissions to provide for the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of the NAAQS. The infrastructure requirements are designed to ensure that the structural components of each state's air quality management program are adequate to meet the state's responsibilities under the CAA. Pennsylvania has formally submitted a SIP revision addressing certain infrastructure elements for certain sections of the CAA for the 2015 8-hour ozone NAAQS. EPA is approving Pennsylvania's submittal addressing these infrastructure requirements for the 2015 ozone NAAQS in accordance with the requirements of the CAA.
