## Summary

The Farm Service Agency (FSA) is announcing the availability of $200 million through the new Food Safety Certification for Specialty Crops Program (FSCSC) for specialty crop operations that incur eligible on-farm food safety program expenses to obtain or renew a food safety certification in calendar years 2022 or 2023. To be eligible for assistance with expenses related to a 2022 food safety certification, the certification must have been issued on or after June 21, 2022. Specialty crop operations incur significant costs to comply with regulatory requirements and market-driven food safety certification requirements each year with little opportunity to recover the increased costs. In this document, FSA is providing the eligibility requirements, application process, and payment calculation for FSCSC.
