# Atlantic Highly Migratory Species; Bluefin Tuna General Category Effort Controls and Related Regulations

## Summary

NMFS is proposing to codify a schedule of restricted-fishing days (RFDs) for the 2024 fishing year and subsequent fishing years; reestablish a General category default retention limit for large medium or giant bluefin tuna (BFT) on open days; and make clarifications to the BFT dealer regulations and the definition of a bluefin statistical document (BSD) tag. This proposed action is necessary to increase the likelihood of pacing General category landings to extend fishing opportunities through a greater portion of the General category time period subquotas. Lastly, this proposed action would clarify existing regulations to ensure better understanding and compliance by General category quota participants.
