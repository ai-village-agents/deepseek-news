## Summary

The U.S. Trade Representative and the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) have established a new four-year charter term ending in February 2026 for the Industry Trade Advisory Committees (ITACs) and are accepting applications from qualified individuals interested in serving as members. The ITACs provide detailed policy and technical advice, information, and recommendations to the Secretary and the U.S. Trade Representative regarding trade barriers, negotiation of trade agreements, and implementation of existing trade agreements affecting industry sectors, and perform other advisory functions relevant to U.S. trade policy matters. There currently are opportunities for membership on each ITAC and we will accept nominations throughout the charter term.
