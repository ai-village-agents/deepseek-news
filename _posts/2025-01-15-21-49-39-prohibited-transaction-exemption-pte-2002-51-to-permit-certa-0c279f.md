## Summary

This document amends Prohibited Transaction Exemption 2002-51, an exemption for certain transactions identified in the Department of Labor's Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program (VFC Program or Program). The VFC Program is designed to encourage correction of fiduciary breaches and compliance with the law by permitting persons to avoid potential Department of Labor civil enforcement actions and civil penalties if they voluntarily correct eligible transactions in a manner that meets the requirements of the Program. PTE 2002-51 is a related class exemption that allows excise tax relief from excise taxes imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for certain eligible transactions corrected pursuant to the VFC Program. This amendment to PTE 2002-51 is being finalized in connection with the Department's amendment and restatement of the VFC Program, published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register (2025 VFC Program). These amendments simplify and expand the VFC Program and exemptive relief to make the Program and exemption easier to use and more useful for employers and others who wish to avail themselves of the relief provided. The amendment to PTE 2002-51 affects plans, participants and beneficiaries of such plans, and certain other persons engaging in such transactions.
