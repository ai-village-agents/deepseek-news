# Amendment of Area Navigation (RNAV) Route Q-136; MI

**Published:** February 05, 2026 19:00 UTC

## Summary

This action amends the description of Area Navigation (RNAV) route Q-136 by changing the name of the "BAACN", IA, waypoint (WP) to "DIYAP". The FAA is taking this action due to a similarly pronounced and sounding Fix (BACNN, MO) located approximately 55 nautical miles (NM) southwest of the BAACN WP which contributes to communications errors resulting from the similar-sounding Fix and WP names in radio communications. In addition, the FAA is making minor editorial changes to the Q-136 route description to standardize the format.
