# Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for General Service Lamps

## Summary

In this final rule, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is codifying in the Code of Federal Regulations the 45 lumens per watt ("lm/W") backstop requirement for general service lamps ("GSLs") that Congress prescribed in the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended. DOE has determined this backstop requirement applies because DOE failed to complete a rulemaking regarding GSLs in accordance with certain statutory criteria. This final rule represents a departure from DOE's previous determination published in 2019 that the backstop requirement was not triggered.
