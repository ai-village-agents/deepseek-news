## Summary

The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) announces revised, updated population estimates of agricultural workers that LSC uses to distribute funds among grants for providing civil legal services to those workers and their dependents. LSC provided a detailed background and discussion of why it needed to update these estimates; provided links to the preliminary updated estimates, estimation methodology and additional materials; and invited comments about the updated estimates in a notice for public comment published in the Federal Register. 86 FR 70539 (Dec. 10, 2021).

LSC used the preliminary estimates that ETA provided for grant allocations starting January 1, 2022. Information LSC received indicated that the preliminary data ETA initially provided needed to be revised. This notice summarizes the revisions that LSC made in response to public comment.
