## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on behalf of Allegheny County. These revisions include administrative amendments made to the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD) Rules and Regulations, Article XXI, Air Pollution Control. Specifically, the revisions added a definition for "County Council;" deleted its current listing of ambient air quality standards and added, through incorporation by reference, all national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) promulgated by EPA; revised references to the "Board of County Commissioners" to "County Executive" or "County Council;" added the "Manager of the Air Quality Program or their respective designee" as a signatory for enforcement orders; and revised a reference from the "Bureau of Environmental Quality Division of Air Quality" to "Air Quality Program of the Department." This action is being taken under the Clean Air Act (CAA).
