## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily determines that Both-Well (Taizhou) Steel Fittings Co., Ltd. (Both- Well), the sole mandatory respondent in this review and an exporter of forged steel fittings from the People's Republic of China (China), as well as four additional exporters of forged steel fittings from China, sold subject merchandise in the United States at prices below normal value (NV) during the period of review (POR) November 1, 2020, through October 31, 2021. Further, Commerce preliminarily determines that Jiangsu Forged Pipe Fittings Co., Ltd.
