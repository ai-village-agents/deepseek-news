## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) adopts rules to implement the Low Power Protection Act (LPPA or Act), which was enacted on January 5, 2023. The LPPA provides certain low power television (LPTV) stations with a limited window of opportunity to apply for primary spectrum use status as Class A television stations. With limited exceptions, the rules adopted herein are consistent with the Commission's proposals in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in this proceeding. In this Order, we further the implementation of the LPPA by establishing the period during which eligible stations may file applications for Class A status, eligibility and interference requirements, and the process for submitting applications.
