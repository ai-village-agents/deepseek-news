## Summary

This action amends Class D airspace and Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface for Greenville Mid- Delta Airport, Greenville, MS, as the Greenville Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) has been decommissioned, and associated approaches cancelled. This action updates the airports name, and removes Class E airspace designated as an extension to Class D airspace. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.
