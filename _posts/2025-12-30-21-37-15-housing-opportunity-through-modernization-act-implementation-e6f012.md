## Summary

This document further extends the compliance date for HUD's final rule entitled Housing Opportunity Through Modernization Act of 2016: Implementation of Sections 102 and 104 (HOTMA final rule) for Community Planning and Development (CPD) programs. Specifically, HUD is extending the compliance date for the HOME Investment Partnerships program (HOME), HOME-American Rescue Plan program, Housing Trust Fund (HTF), Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS (HOPWA), Community Development Block Grant program (CDBG), Emergency Solution Grants (ESG), Continuum of Care (CoC) programs, and CPD programs funded through competitive processes (Competitive Programs). This action is necessary to allow additional time for HUD to finalize necessary system updates and for CPD grantees to fully incorporate the new income and asset requirements into their programs.
