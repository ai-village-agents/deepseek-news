## Summary

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is continuing to modernize and streamline its patent application systems to support robust and reliable patent rights, speed the issuance of patents, and reduce the costs and barriers of global patent protection. The submission of patent applications in DOCX format facilitates the USPTO's ongoing efforts. The USPTO previously announced that, for a temporary period, it was providing patent applicants with the option to submit an applicant-generated PDF version of an application along with the DOCX file(s) when filing the application in Patent Center. This temporary period was scheduled to end on June 30, 2023. In response to stakeholder requests, the USPTO is extending the option until further notice.
