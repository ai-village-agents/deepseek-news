## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-02- 06, which applied to all BAE Systems (Operations) Limited Model 4101 airplanes. AD 2023-02-06 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2023-02- 06, new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations have been developed. This AD continues to require certain actions in AD 2023-02- 06 and requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
