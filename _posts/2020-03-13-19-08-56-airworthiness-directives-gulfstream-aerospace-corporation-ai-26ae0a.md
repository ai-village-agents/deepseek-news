## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation Model GVII-G500 and GVII-G600 airplanes. This AD requires revising the airplane flight manual (AFM) for your airplane to incorporate revised limitations and procedures. This AD was prompted by a report of a landing incident where the alpha limiter engaged in the landing flare in unstable air while on the approach, resulting in a high rate of descent landing and damage to the airplane. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
