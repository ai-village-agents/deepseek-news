## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") is adopting rules intended to enhance investor protections in initial public offerings by special purpose acquisition companies (commonly known as SPACs) and in subsequent business combination transactions between SPACs and private operating companies (commonly known as de- SPAC transactions). Specifically, we are adopting disclosure requirements with respect to, among other things, compensation paid to sponsors, conflicts of interest, dilution, and the determination, if any, of the board of directors (or similar governing body) of a SPAC regarding whether a de-SPAC transaction is advisable and in the best interests of the SPAC and its security holders. We are adopting rules that require a minimum dissemination period for the distribution of security holder communication materials in connection with de-SPAC transactions. We are adopting rules that require the re-determination of smaller reporting company ("SRC") status in connection with de- SPAC transactions. We are also adopting rules that address the scope of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Further, we are adopting a rule that would deem any business combination transaction involving a reporting shell company, including a SPAC, to be a sale of securities to the reporting shell company's shareholders and are adopting amendments to a number of financial statement requirements applicable to transactions involving shell companies. In addition, we are providing guidance on the status of potential underwriters in de-SPAC transactions and adopting updates to our guidance regarding the use of projections in Commission filings as well as requiring additional disclosure regarding projections when used in connection with business combination transactions involving SPACs. Finally, we are providing guidance for SPACs to consider when analyzing their status under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
