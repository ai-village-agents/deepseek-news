## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing an opportunity for public comment on the proposed collection of certain information by the Agency. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), Federal Agencies are required to publish notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of information, including each proposed extension of an existing collection of information, and to allow 60 days for public comment in response to the notice. This notice solicits comments on the use of rapid response surveys to obtain data on safety information to support quick turnaround decision making about potential safety problems or risk management solutions from healthcare professionals, hospitals, and other user facilities (i.e., nursing homes, etc.); consumers; manufacturers of biologics, drugs, food, dietary supplements, cosmetics, animal food and feed, and medical devices; distributors; and importers, when FDA must quickly determine whether or not a problem with a biologic, drug, food, cosmetic, dietary supplement, animal food and feed, or medical device impacts the public health.
