## Summary

The FAA is revising a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-08-08, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A318-111, -112, -121, -122 airplanes; Model 319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, -133, -151N, -153N, and - 171N airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, -233, - 251N, -252N, -253N, -271N, -272N, and -273N airplanes; and Model A321- 111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, -232, -251N, -251NX, -252N, - 252NX, -253N, -253NX, -271N, -271NX, -272N, and -272NX airplanes. This action revises the NPRM by adding requirements for certain airplanes. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over that in the NPRM, the FAA is reopening the comment period to allow the public the chance to comment on these changes.
