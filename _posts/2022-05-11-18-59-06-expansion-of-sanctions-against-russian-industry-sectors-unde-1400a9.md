## Summary

In response to the Russian Federation's (Russia's) ongoing aggression against Ukraine, the Department of Commerce is expanding the existing sanctions against Russian industry sectors by imposing a license requirement for exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) to and within Russia for additional items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) identified under specific Schedule B numbers or Harmonized Tariff Schedule codes. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is taking these actions to further restrict Russia's ability to withstand the economic impact of the multilateral sanctions, further limit sources of revenue that could support Russia's military capabilities, and to better align with the European Union's controls.
