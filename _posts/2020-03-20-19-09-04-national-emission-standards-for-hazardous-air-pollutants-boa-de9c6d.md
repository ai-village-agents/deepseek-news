# National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Boat Manufacturing and Reinforced Plastic Composites Production Risk and Technology Review

## Summary

This action finalizes the residual risk and technology reviews (RTR) conducted for the Boat Manufacturing and the Reinforced Plastic Composites Production source categories regulated under national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP). In addition, we are taking final action addressing emissions during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) and amending provisions regarding electronic reporting of performance test and performance evaluation results and semiannual reports. These final amendments include removal of regulatory language that is inconsistent with the requirement that the standards apply at all times, inclusion of language requiring electronic reporting of performance test and performance evaluation results and semiannual reports, and an amendment to the Reinforced Plastic Composites Production NESHAP to clarify that mixers that route to a capture and control device system with at least 95-percent efficiency overall are not required to have covers. The numeric emission limits of the standards for both source categories remain unchanged.
