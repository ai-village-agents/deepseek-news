# Airworthiness Directives; Bombardier, Inc., Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-1A10 and BD-700-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports indicating that the left- and right-hand elevator torque tube bearings were contaminated with sand and corrosion, restricting free rotation. This proposed AD would require repetitive general visual inspections of the left- and right- hand elevator torque tube bearings for any sand, dust, or corrosion; repetitive functional tests of the elevator control system; and replacement of the elevator torque tube bearings if necessary. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
