## Summary

VA is rescinding an outdated system of records titled, "Veteran, Employee and Citizen Health Care Facility Investigation Records--VA" (32VA10Q). This system was used to conduct statistical studies and analyses which supported the formulation of departmental policies and plans by identifying the total current health care usage of the VA patient population. The records and information were also used by VA for audit and evaluation of department programs, determinations of eligibility for benefits, and to conduct research. The system was discontinued on September 30, 2002.
