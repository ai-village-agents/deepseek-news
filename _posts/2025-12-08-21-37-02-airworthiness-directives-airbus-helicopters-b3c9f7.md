# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model AS332C, AS332C1, AS332L, AS332L1, and SA330J helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of fatigue cracks found on arms of the tail rotor (TR) pitch change spider due to a load increase originating from degraded bearing stacks. This proposed AD would introduce reduced life limit intervals for the affected bearing stack and would require replacing the affected bearing stack before exceeding these intervals. This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of the affected bearing stack on a helicopter, unless certain requirements are met. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
