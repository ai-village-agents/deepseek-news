## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the State of New York's State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) related to a Source-specific SIP (SSSIP) revision for Finch Paper LLC, located at 1 Glen Street, Glens Falls, New York (Facility). The control options in this SSSIP revision address nitrogen oxide (NO<INF>X</INF>) Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) for the Facility sources identified as four power boilers, a wood waste boiler, and four recovery boilers. The intended effect of this SSSIP revision is to approve NO<INF>X</INF> RACT for the Facility sources required for implementation of the 2008 and 2015 ozone NAAQS. This proposed action will not interfere with ozone NAAQS requirements and meets all applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
