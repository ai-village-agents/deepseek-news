## Summary

The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) proposes to add a regulation implementing a provision of the First Step Act (FSA) that requires Federal Prison Industries (FPI) and the BOP to reserve a portion of the compensation inmates would otherwise receive for working to assist these inmates with costs associated with release from prison upon completion of their sentence through release from custody, placement in pre-release custody (e.g., home confinement or Residential Reentry Center), or conditional release.
