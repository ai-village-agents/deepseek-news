## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) and accompanying environmental assessment (EA) regarding the NRC's consideration of a license amendment request by Omaha Public Power District (OPPD) to approve the License Termination Plan (LTP) for the Fort Calhoun Station, Unit 1 (FCS), located in Washington County, Nebraska. If approved, the amendment would add a license condition to the FCS license reflecting the NRC's approval of its LTP and establishing criteria for determining when changes to the LTP require prior NRC approval. OPPD would use the LTP to meet the requirements for terminating the license and releasing the site for unrestricted use. Based on the EA, the NRC staff has concluded that there will be no significant impacts to environmental resources from the requested license amendment, and therefore, a FONSI is appropriate.
