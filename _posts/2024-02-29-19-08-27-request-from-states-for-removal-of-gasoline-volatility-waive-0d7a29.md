## Summary

Pursuant to provisions specified by the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Governors of Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin submitted petitions requesting that EPA remove the 1-pound per square inch (psi) Reid vapor pressure (RVP) waiver for summer gasoline-ethanol blended fuels containing 10 percent ethanol (E10). EPA is acting on those petitions by removing the 1-psi waiver in those States effective April 28, 2025. This action also finalizes regulatory amendments to implement the removal of the 1-psi waiver for E10 in those States, as well as a regulatory process by which a State may request to reinstate the 1-psi waiver. Finally, consistent with a decision issued by the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on July 2, 2021, this action removes regulations that extended the 1-psi waiver to gasoline-ethanol blends between 10 and 15 percent ethanol (E15).
