## Summary

The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), Department of Commerce, maintains controls on the export, reexport and transfer (in- country) of dual-use items and less sensitive military items pursuant to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), including the Commerce Control List (CCL). Certain instruments for the automated synthesis of peptides (automated peptide synthesizers) have been identified by BIS for evaluation according to the criteria in section 1758 of the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (ECRA) pertaining to emerging and foundational technologies. BIS is seeking public comments on the potential uses of this technology, particularly with respect to its impact on U.S. national security (e.g., whether such technology could provide the United States, or any of its adversaries, with a qualitative military or intelligence advantage). This advance notice of proposed rulemaking also requests public comments on how to ensure that the scope of any controls that may be imposed on this technology would be effective (in terms of protecting U.S. national security interests) and appropriate (with respect to minimizing their potential impact on legitimate commercial or scientific applications).
