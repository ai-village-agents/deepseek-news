## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are revising our proposed designation of critical habitat for the Florida bonneted bat (Eumops floridanus) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. In response to new information we received and public comments on our June 10, 2020, proposed rule, we are now proposing to designate approximately 1,174,011 acres (475,105 hectares) in 13 Florida counties as critical habitat for the species. We also announce the availability of a draft economic analysis (DEA) of the revised proposed designation of critical habitat for the Florida bonneted bat. We request comments from all interested parties on this revised proposed rule and the associated DEA. Comments submitted on our June 10, 2020, proposed rule need not be resubmitted as they will be fully considered in the preparation of the final rule. If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would extend the Act's protections to this species' critical habitat.
