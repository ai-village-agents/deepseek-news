## Summary

The OATSD(PCLT) is giving notice of a proposed rulemaking for an existing component-wide system of records pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974 titled CIG-16, "Inspector General Administrative Investigation Records," which was modified and reissued on May 31, 2022. In this rulemaking, the Department proposes to amend the existing rule for CIG-16 in order to exempt portions of this system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act because of national security and law enforcement requirements; to avoid interference during the conduct of criminal, civil, or administrative actions or investigations; and to protect the identity of confidential sources incident to Federal employment, military service, contract, and security clearance determinations.
