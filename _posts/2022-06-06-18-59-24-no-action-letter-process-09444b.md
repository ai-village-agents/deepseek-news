## Summary

FinCEN is issuing this advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) to solicit public comment on questions relating to the implementation of a no-action letter process at FinCEN. Given that the addition of a no-action letter process at FinCEN may affect or overlap with other forms of regulatory guidance and relief that FinCEN already offers, including administrative rulings and exceptive or exemptive relief, this ANPRM, among other things, seeks public input on whether a no-action letter process should be implemented and, if so, how the no- action letter process should interact with those other forms of relief.
