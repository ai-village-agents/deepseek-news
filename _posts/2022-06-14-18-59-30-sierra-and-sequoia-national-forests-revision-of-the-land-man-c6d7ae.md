## Summary

The Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, is revising the Sierra and Sequoia National Forests' Land Management Plans (Forest Plans). The Forest Service has prepared a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for the revised Forest Plans and draft Records of Decision (ROD). This notice is to inform the public that the Sierra and Sequoia National Forests are initiating a 60-day period where individuals or entities with specific concerns about the Sierra and Sequoia National Forests' revised Forest Plans and the associated FEIS may file objections for Forest Service review prior to the approval of the revised Forest Plans. This is also an opportunity to object to the Regional Forester's list of species of conservation concern for the Sierra and Sequoia National Forests.
