## Summary

This initial determination proposes to revise the list required by Executive Order No. 13126 ("Prohibition of Acquisition of Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Child Labor") (E.O. List) in accordance with the Department of Labor's (DOL) "Procedural Guidelines for the Maintenance of the List of Products Requiring Federal Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor" (the Procedural Guidelines). The E.O. List identifies a list of products, by their country of origin, that DOL, in consultation and cooperation with the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security (hereinafter "the three Departments"), has a reasonable basis to believe might have been mined, produced, or manufactured by forced or indentured child labor. Federal contracting officers must check the E.O. List when issuing a solicitation for supplies expected to exceed the micro-purchase threshold and take certain steps if the solicited product appears on the list. This notice proposes to remove shrimp from Thailand and garments from Vietnam because the three Departments have preliminarily determined that the use of forced or indentured child labor in the production of these products has been significantly reduced. The Department of Labor invites public comment on this initial determination. The three Departments will consider all public comments prior to publishing a final determination revising the E.O. List.
