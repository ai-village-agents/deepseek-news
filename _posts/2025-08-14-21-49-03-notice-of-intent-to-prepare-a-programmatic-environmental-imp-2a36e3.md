## Summary

The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) New Mexico State Office announces its intent to prepare a PEIS for the HPCC Burn Scar Project, in Mora, Colfax, Taos, Rio Arriba, Santa Fe, Guadalupe, and San Miguel Counties, New Mexico. The PEIS will examine alternative solutions to address flooding, sedimentation, erosion, water quality impairments, and agricultural water management on private lands due to loss of land cover and the overall burn severity of the HPCC fire. The project area is approximately 500 square miles and includes 33 Hydrologic Unit Code-12 watersheds within nine Hydrologic Unit Code-10 watersheds (nine watersheds). The primary purpose for the PEIS is to provide improvement to increase the flood resilience to protect the communities that have been affected by the HPCC fire and restore the project areas' function that is essential to healthy streams and clean water; healthy forest, soil, and ecosystem; and healthy flora and fauna on private lands and in conjunction with other restoration efforts on National Forest System (NFS) lands. NRCS is requesting comments to identify significant issues, potential alternatives, information, and analyses relevant to the Proposed Action from all interested individuals, Federal and State agencies, and Tribes and Pueblos.
