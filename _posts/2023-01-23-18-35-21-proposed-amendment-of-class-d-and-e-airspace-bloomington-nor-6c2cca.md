## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class D and Class E airspace at Bloomington/Normal, IL. The FAA is proposing this action due to an airspace review conducted as part of the decommissioning of the Bloomington very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimum Operating Network (MON) Program. The name and geographic coordinates of the airport would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
