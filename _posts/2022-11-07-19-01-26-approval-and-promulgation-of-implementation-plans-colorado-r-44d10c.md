## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to Regulation Number 3 of the Colorado Code of Regulations (CCR) submitted to the EPA by the State of Colorado on March 22, 2021. These revisions reflect changes made by the State to update dates of incorporation by reference of sections of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) related to Global Warming Potentials (GWPs). The revisions also include updated references to other sections of the CCR that were previously moved to a new location as well as changes to Regulation 3 to reflect digitalization of public notice and comment procedures. The EPA is taking this action pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA).
