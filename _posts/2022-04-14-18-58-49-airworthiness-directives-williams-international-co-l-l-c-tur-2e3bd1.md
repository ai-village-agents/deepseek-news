## Summary

The FAA is revising a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that applied to certain Williams International Co., L.L.C. (Williams) FJ44-2A, FJ44-2C, FJ44-3A, and FJ44-3A-24 model turbofan engines. This action revises the NPRM by expanding the applicability, updating the estimated costs information, updating the compliance time, and adding an installation prohibition. This action also revises the NPRM by updating the service information references. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive (AD) to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over those in the NPRM, the agency is requesting comments on this SNPRM.
