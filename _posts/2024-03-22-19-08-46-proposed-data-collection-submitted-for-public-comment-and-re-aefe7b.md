## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Generic Clearance for the Collection of Minimal Data Necessary for Case Data During an Emergency Response. This information collection will allow CDC to collect the minimum data necessary for confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of any disease or condition that is the subject of an emergency response.
