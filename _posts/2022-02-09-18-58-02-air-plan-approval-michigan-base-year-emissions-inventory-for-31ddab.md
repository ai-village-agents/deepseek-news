## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving, under the Clean Air Act (CAA), revisions to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) on June 30, 2021. The revisions address the emission inventory requirements for the St. Clair County nonattainment area under the 2010 sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS or standard). The CAA requires states to develop and submit, as SIP revisions, emission inventories for all areas designated as nonattainment for any NAAQS. EPA proposed to approve this action on October 26, 2021, and received no adverse comments.
