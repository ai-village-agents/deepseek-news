## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to correct sections in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), erroneously caused by administrative oversight, to reflect the current status of conditional approval provisions in the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). These corrections concern Antelope Valley Air Quality Management District's (AVAQMD's) reasonably available control technology (RACT) SIP demonstration requirements for the 1997 and 2008 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and Imperial County Air Pollution Control District's (ICAPCD's) RACT SIP demonstration requirements for the 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS.
