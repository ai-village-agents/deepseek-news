## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) requirement, the Farm Service Agency (FSA) is requesting comments from all interested individuals and organizations on the two Farm Loan Programs' information collection requests. FSA is also requesting an extension with a revision for those currently approved information collection requests. The two collection requests in the Farm Loan Programs are: Guaranteed Farm Loan Program and General Program Administration. In the General Program Administration, the information collected is used to ensure that applicants meet statutory eligibility requirements, loan funds are used for authorized purposes, and the Government's interest in security is adequately protected. In the Guaranteed Farm Loan Program, the collected information is needed to make and service loans guaranteed by FSA to eligible farmers and ranchers by commercial lenders and nontraditional lenders.
