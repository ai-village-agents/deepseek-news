## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission or FCC) adopts rules as required by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Infrastructure Act) to help consumers comparison shop among broadband services. Specifically, the rules require broadband internet service providers (ISPs) to display, at the point of sale, a broadband consumer label containing critical information about the provider's service offerings, including information about pricing, introductory rates, data allowances, performance metrics, and whether the provider participates in the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP).
