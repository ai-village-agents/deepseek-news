## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency or we) is evaluating substances that have been nominated for inclusion on a list of bulk drug substances (i.e., active pharmaceutical ingredients) for which there is a clinical need (the 503B Bulks List). Drug products that outsourcing facilities compound using bulk drug substances on the 503B Bulks List can qualify for certain exemptions from the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) provided certain conditions are met. This notice identifies four bulk drug substances that FDA has considered and is including on the list at this time: Diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP) for topical use only, glycolic acid for topical use only in concentrations up to 70 percent, squaric acid dibutyl ester (SADBE) for topical use only, and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) for topical use only. This notice also identifies eight bulk drug substances that FDA has considered and is not including on the list at this time: diazepam, dipyridamole, dobutamine hydrochloride (HCl), dopamine HCl, edetate calcium disodium, folic acid, glycopyrrolate, and sodium thiosulfate (except for topical administration). Additional bulk drug substances nominated by the public for inclusion on this list are currently under consideration and will be the subject of future notices.
