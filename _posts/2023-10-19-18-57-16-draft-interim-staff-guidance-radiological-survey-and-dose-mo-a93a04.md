## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is soliciting public comment on draft Interim Staff Guidance (ISG), DUWP-ISG-02, "Radiological Survey and Dose Modeling of the Subsurface to Support License Termination." The purpose of this draft ISG is to provide guidance on surveys of open surfaces in the subsurface, including open excavations, materials planned for reuse, and substructures. This draft ISG also provides guidance on the use of commonly used decommissioning dose modeling codes for submerged and partially submerged substructures to develop clean-up levels, and on methods to evaluate risk from existing groundwater contamination. This draft ISG supplements guidance found in NUREG-1757, Volume 2, Revision 2, which pertains to licensees subject to the license termination rule found in NRC regulations. If finalized, this ISG is intended for use by applicants, licensees, and NRC staff. The guidance is also available to Agreement States and the public.
