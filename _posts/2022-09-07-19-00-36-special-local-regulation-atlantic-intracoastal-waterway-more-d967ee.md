## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary special local regulation (SLR) for certain navigable waters of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway (AICW) and Beaufort Inlet in Morehead City, North Carolina. This SLR restricts vessel traffic on the AICW and Beaufort Inlet during high-speed boat races. The restriction of vessel traffic movement in the SLR is to protect participants and spectators from the hazards posed by these events. Entry of vessels or persons into this regulated area is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port (COTP) North Carolina or a designated representative.
