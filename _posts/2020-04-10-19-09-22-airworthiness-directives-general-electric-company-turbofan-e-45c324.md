## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain General Electric Company (GE) CF34-1A, CF34-3A, CF34-3A1, CF34- 3A2, CF34-3B, and CF34-3B1 model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by an in-flight failure of a fan blade that led to an in-flight shutdown. This AD requires removal and replacement of the affected fan blades. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
