## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-11-05, which applies to all Pilatus Aircraft Ltd. (Pilatus) Model PC-24 airplanes. AD 2023-11-05 requires revising the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the existing aircraft maintenance manual (AMM) or instructions for continued airworthiness (ICA) to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2023-11-05, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would require revising the ALS of the existing AMM or ICA for your airplane. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
