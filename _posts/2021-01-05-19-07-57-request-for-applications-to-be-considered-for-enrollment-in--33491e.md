## Summary

The Maritime Administration (MARAD) requests applications from owners and/or operators of eligible vessels to enroll such vessels in the Cable Security Fleet (CSF). The CSF Program is a newly-authorized program intended to maintain a fleet of active, commercially viable, privately owned United States-flag cable vessels to meet national security requirements and to maintain a United States presence in the international submarine cable services market. The CSF will consist of two vessels. This Notice describes, among other things, statutory requirements to apply and to participate in the CSF, recommendations as to the form and substance of applications, and a deadline for submitting applications for vessel enrollment in the CSF program. The Maritime Administration will negotiate agreements ready for execution with the successful applicants.
