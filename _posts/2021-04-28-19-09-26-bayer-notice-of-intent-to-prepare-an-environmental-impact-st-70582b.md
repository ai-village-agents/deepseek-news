## Summary

We are advising the public that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) plans to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) regarding a request from Bayer seeking a determination of nonregulated status for maize developed using genetic engineering for dicamba, glufosinate, quizalofop, and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid resistance with tissue-specific glyphosate resistance facilitating the production of hybrid maize seed. APHIS is requesting public comment to help identify alternatives, and relevant information, studies, and/ or analyses APHIS should consider in the EIS.
