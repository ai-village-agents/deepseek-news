## Summary

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is proposing to amend its regulations to incorporate by reference, with certain enumerated exceptions, the latest version (Version 3.2) of business practice standards adopted by the Wholesale Gas Quadrant of the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) applicable to natural gas pipelines in place of the currently incorporated version (Version 3.1) of those business practice standards. The revisions made by NAESB in this version of the standards are designed to enhance the natural gas industries' system and software security measures and to clarify the processing of certain business transactions.
