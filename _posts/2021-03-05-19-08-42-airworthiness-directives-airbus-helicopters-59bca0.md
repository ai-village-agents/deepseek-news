## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Helicopters Model EC 155B, EC155B1, SA-365N, SA- 365N1, AS-365N2, and AS 365 N3 helicopters, as identified in a European Aviation Safety Agency (now European Union Aviation Safety Agency) (EASA) AD. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of an in-flight loss of engine and main gearbox (MGB) cowlings. This proposed AD would require inspecting the MGB fixed cowling front fitting (MGB front fitting), and depending on findings, corrective action. This proposed AD would also require a new modification, which would constitute a terminating action for the inspection. These proposed AD requirements are as specified in an EASA AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
