The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has submitted an information collection request (ICR), Section 8 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) (EPA ICR Number 2703.01, OMB Control Number 2070- NEW) to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act. This is a request to consolidate certain activities currently covered under other existing ICRs. Public comments were previously requested via the Federal Register on March 8, 2022, during a 60-day comment period. This notice allows for an additional 30 days for public comments. A fuller description of the ICR is given below, including its estimated burden and cost to the public. An agency may not conduct or sponsor and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
