## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2025-07- 02, which applied to certain BRP-Rotax GmbH & Co KG (Rotax) Model 912 iSc2 Sport, 912 iSc3 Sport, 915 iSc2 C24, and 915 iSc3 C24 engines. AD 2025-07-02 required repetitive operational checks of the battery backup function with removal of the engine from service if insufficient battery power is found, one-time inspections of the oil spray nozzle and generator stator assembly, and, depending on the results of the inspections, replacement with parts eligible for installation. Since the FAA issued AD 2025-07-02, the FAA has determined that the inspection of the generator stator assembly should be an on-condition action depending on the results of the oil spray nozzle inspection. This AD retains all of the requirements of AD 2025-07-02 and changes the one-time inspection of the generator stator assembly and wiring to an on-condition action based on the results of the one-time inspection of the oil spray nozzle. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
