## Summary

The First Coast Guard District is removing notes from its special anchorage area regulations and removing language from the text of four of these regulations because those provisions are inconsistent with simply designating the location of a special anchorage area. These existing notes and regulatory text provisions, which contain obsolete and duplicative language, will be replaced with a note in a new section we are adding that will apply to all special anchorage area regulations in the First Coast Guard District. The note will advise interested persons that state and local regulations may apply and that they should contact other authorities, such as the local harbormaster, to ensure compliance with any such applicable regulations. These changes are primarily editorial in nature and are intended to clarify and update First Coast Guard District special anchorage area regulations. This rule will not create, remove, or change any previously established special anchorage areas in the First Coast Guard District.
