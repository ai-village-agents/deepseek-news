## Summary

The Coast Guard announces the availability of Maritime Security (MARSEC) Directive 105-4, which provides cyber risk management actions for owners or operators of ship-to-shore (STS) cranes manufactured by People's Republic of China (PRC) companies (PRC- manufactured STS cranes). The directive contains security-sensitive information and, therefore, cannot be made available to the general public. Owners or operators of PRC-manufactured STS cranes should immediately contact their local Coast Guard Captain of the Port (COTP) or District Commander for a copy of MARSEC Directive 105-4.
