## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily determines that vertical shaft engines with displacements between 60cc and up to 99cc produced in the People's Republic of China (China) and exported to the United States, are circumventing the antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on certain vertical shaft engines between 99cc and up to 225cc, and parts thereof (small vertical engines), from China. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.
