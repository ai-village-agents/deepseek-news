## Summary

OCSS issues this final rule to provide temporary relief to states from certain child support program performance requirements and penalties during natural disasters and other calamities which have a negative impact on state child support program operations. The rule allows OCSS to modify performance measure requirements when natural disasters and other calamities affect, or are expected to affect, the state child support program's ability to achieve performance standards for paternity establishment, support order establishment, and current collections. The rule enables states to avoid the imposition of penalties due to adverse data reliability audit findings during, and after, natural disasters and other calamities, including pandemics and declared public health emergencies.
