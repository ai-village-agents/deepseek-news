## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew a previously approved information collection. The current Fuel Tank Flammability Safety rule 25.981 requires the Design Approval Holder (DAH) to report to the FAA on the component reliability of the fuel tank flammability reduction means. DAH as specified in AC 25.981-2A is the holder of any design approval, including type certificate, amended type certificate, supplemental type certificate, amended supplemental type certificate, Parts Manufacturer Approval (PMA), Technical Standard Order (TSO) authorization, letter of TSO design approval, and field approvals. As the transport aircraft fleet continues to fly longer than expected and component reliability may be affected or degraded, the data collection is needed on an on-going basis to ensure the aircraft fuel tank safety level continues to meet the predicted reliability at the time of certification. This collection of information supports the FAA's Safety Management System (SMS) safety goal and by proactively identifying hazards and mitigating risks before incidents occur.
