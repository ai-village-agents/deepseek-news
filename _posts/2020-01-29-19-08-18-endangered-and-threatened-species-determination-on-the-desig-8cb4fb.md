## Summary

We, NMFS, have determined that a designation of critical habitat for the chambered nautilus (Nautilus pompilius) is not prudent at this time. Based on a comprehensive review of the best scientific data available, we find that there are no areas that meet the definition of critical habitat for the species; the species primarily occurs outside the jurisdiction of the United States, and areas within the jurisdiction of the United States provide no more than negligible conservation value, if any. Given the above circumstances, we have determined that a designation of critical habitat for this species is not prudent.
