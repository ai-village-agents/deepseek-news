# Revising Spectrum Sharing Rules for Non-Geostationary Orbit, Fixed-Satellite Service Systems

## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission or we) seeks comment on revisions to its rules governing spectrum sharing among a new generation of broadband satellite constellations to promote market entry, regulatory certainty, and spectrum efficiency. Specifically, the Commission seeks comment on which metrics should be used to define the protection afforded to a non-geostationary satellite orbit, fixed-satellite service (NGSO FSS) system authorized through an earlier processing round from an NGSO FSS system authorized through a later processing round, including the implementation of a degraded throughput methodology.
