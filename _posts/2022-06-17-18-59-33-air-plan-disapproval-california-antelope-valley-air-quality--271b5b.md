## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to disapprove revisions to the Antelope Valley Air Quality Management District (AVAQMD) and the Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District (MDAQMD) portions of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) concerning rules submitted to address section 185 of the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act) with respect to the 1-hour ozone standard. We are proposing action on these local rules that were submitted as equivalent alternatives to a statutory section 185 program. We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
