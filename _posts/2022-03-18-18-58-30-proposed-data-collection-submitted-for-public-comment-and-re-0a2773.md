## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS). The goal of this project is to assess the health of the population through patient use of physician and advanced practice provider offices and health centers (HCs), and to monitor the characteristics of physician and provider practices.
