## Summary

This action amends Class E surface airspace in Dyersburg, TN, as the Nally Dunston non-directional beacon (NDB) has been decommissioned, and associated approaches cancelled for Dyersburg Regional Airport. This action updates the airport's name and geographic coordinates. In addition, this action makes an editorial change replacing the term Airport/Facility Directory with the term Chart Supplement in the legal description of associated Class E airspace. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.
