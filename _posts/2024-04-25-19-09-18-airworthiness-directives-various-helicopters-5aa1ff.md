# Airworthiness Directives; Various Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for various helicopters modified by certain supplemental type certificates (STCs) that approve the installation of an emergency float kit or an emergency float with liferaft kit. This proposed AD was prompted by the results of an accident investigation and subsequent reports of difficulty pulling the emergency float kit float activation handle installed on the pilot cyclic. This proposed AD would require repetitively inspecting the pull force on the float activation handle and, depending on the results, accomplishing corrective actions. For certain model helicopters, this proposed AD would also require removing from service and replacing certain part-numbered float inflation reservoirs (reservoirs) and pull cable assemblies (cables) with certain other part-numbered reservoirs and cables. Finally, this proposed AD would prohibit installing certain part-numbered reservoirs and cables on certain helicopters. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
