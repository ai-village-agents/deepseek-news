## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of cocamidopropylamine oxide (CAS Reg. No. 68155-09-9) when used as an inert ingredient (surfactant) at a concentration not to exceed 6% by weight in glyphosate formulations. SciReg, Inc., on behalf of Albaugh, LLC submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting the establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of cocamidopropylamine oxide when used in accordance with this exemption.
