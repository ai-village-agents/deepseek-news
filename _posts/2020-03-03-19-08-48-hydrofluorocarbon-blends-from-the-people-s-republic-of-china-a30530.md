## Summary

The Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily determines that imports of unpatented R-421A from the People's Republic of China (China) are circumventing the antidumping duty (AD) order on HFC blends from China. As a result, imports of blends of unpatented R-421A from China will be subject to suspension of liquidation effective June 18, 2019. We invite interested parties to comment on this preliminary determination.
