## Summary

Consistent with a Global Technical Regulation on electric vehicle safety, NHTSA proposes to establish Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 305a to replace FMVSS No. 305, "Electric- powered vehicles: Electrolyte spillage and electrical shock protection." Among other improvements, FMVSS No. 305a would apply to light and heavy vehicles and would have performance and risk mitigation requirements for the propulsion battery. Relating to a National Transportation Safety Board recommendation, FMVSS No. 305a would also require manufacturers to submit standardized emergency response information for inclusion on NHTSA's website that would assist first and second responders handling electric vehicles.
