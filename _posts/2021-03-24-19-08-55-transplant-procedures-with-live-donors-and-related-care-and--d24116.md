## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes to amend its medical regulations to implement legislation providing it stand-alone authority to provide surgical procedures to remove a solid organ or bone marrow from a live donor for transplantation into a veteran and to furnish the live donor any care or services before and after the surgical procedure required in connection with the veteran's transplantation procedure. This rulemaking would implement the mandates of section 153 of the VA MISSION Act of 2018.
