## Summary

The Department of Education (Department) announces final priorities, requirements, and a definition under the Project Prevent grant program, Assistance Listing Number (ALN) 84.184M. We may use one or more of these priorities, requirements, and definition for competitions in fiscal year (FY) 2022 and later years. These final priorities and requirements are designed to fund local educational agencies (LEAs) impacted by community violence and expand the capacity of LEAs to implement community- and school-based strategies that prevent and mitigate the impact of community violence. The Department also defines "community violence" for purposes of the Project Prevent grant program.
