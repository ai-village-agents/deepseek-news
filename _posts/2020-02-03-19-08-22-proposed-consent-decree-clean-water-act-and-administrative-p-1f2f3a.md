## Summary

In accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator's, October 16, 2017, Directive Promoting Transparency and Public Participation in Consent Decrees and Settlement Agreements, notice is hereby given of a proposed consent decree to address claims in a lawsuit filed by the Natural Resources Defense Council, Clean Water Action, and the Environmental Justice Health Alliance for Chemical Policy Reform (collectively, "Plaintiffs") in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On March 21, 2019, Plaintiffs filed a complaint alleging, inter alia, that the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") had a duty under Clean Water Act ("CWA") section 311(j)(5)(A)(i), to issue regulations that require an owner or operator of a non-transportation- related onshore "facility described in subparagraph (C) to prepare and submit to the President a plan for responding, to the maximum extent practicable, to a worst case discharge, and to a substantial threat of such a discharge, of . . . a hazardous substance" (the "Hazardous Substance Worst Case Discharge Planning Regulations") by August 18, 1992. The proposed consent decree would set deadlines for EPA to complete a notice of proposed rulemaking pertaining to the issuance of the Hazardous Substance Worst Case Discharge Planning Regulations, and for publication of a notice taking final action following notice and comment rulemaking pertaining to the issuance of Hazardous Substance Worst Case Discharge Planning Regulations.
