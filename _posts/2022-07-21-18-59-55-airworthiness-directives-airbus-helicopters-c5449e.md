## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-10-10, which applies to all Airbus Helicopters Model SA330J helicopters. AD 2021-10-10 requires repetitively inspecting the main gearbox (MGB) particle detector and the MGB bottom housing (oil sump) for metal particles, analyzing any metal particles that are found, and replacing the MGB if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-10-10, additional review concluded that installing an improved planet gear assembly is necessary. This proposed AD would continue to require repetitively inspecting the MGB particle detector and the MGB bottom housing (oil sump) for metal particles, and analyzing any metal particles that are found, and would also require replacing the planet gear assembly and repetitively inspecting and establishing an airworthiness limitation for that assembly as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
