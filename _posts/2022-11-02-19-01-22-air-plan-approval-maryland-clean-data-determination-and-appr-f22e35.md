## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is making a determination that the the Anne Arundel County and Baltimore County, Maryland sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) nonattainment area has attained the 2010 primary SO<INF>2</INF> national ambient air quality standard (2010 SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS). Under EPA's Clean Data Policy, certain Clean Air Act (CAA) planning requirements are suspended for a nonattainment area when EPA issues a determination that air quality data demonstrate that the NAAQS is being attained. EPA deems these suspended CAA requirements as no longer applicable for as long as air quality continues to meet the NAAQS. EPA is also simultaneously approving elements of Maryland's January 31, 2020 state implementation plan (SIP) revision submittal containing an attainment plan for the Anne Arundel County and Baltimore County SO<INF>2</INF> nonattainment area (referred to hereafter as the Anne Arundel-Baltimore County Area, or simply the Area). The attainment plan elements EPA is approving are not suspended by a determination of attainment under EPA's Clean Data Policy, because EPA considers them independent of planning requirements that are designed to help the area attain the NAAQS. Finally, EPA is approving as SIP strengthening measures certain emission limit requirements on large SO<INF>2</INF> emission sources that were submitted as part of Maryland's attainment plan. This clean data determination (CDD) and partial approval of Maryland's attainment plan SIP revision does not constitute redesignation of the Area to attainment or full approval of the submitted attainment plan. This action is being taken under the CAA.
