## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") proposes to amend the test procedures for Packaged Terminal Air Conditioners ("PTACs") and Packaged Terminal Heat Pumps ("PTHPs") to establish seasonal energy efficiency metrics for heating and cooling. DOE also proposes to revise the current test procedure to measure dehumidification energy use of make-up air PTACs and PTHPs. DOE is seeking comment from interested parties on the proposal.
