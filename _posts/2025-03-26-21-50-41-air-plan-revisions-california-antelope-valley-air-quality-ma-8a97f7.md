## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing approval of six permitting rules, and limited approval and limited disapproval for one permitting rule, submitted on January 7, 2025, as a revision to the Antelope Valley Air Quality Management District (AVAQMD or "District") portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern the District's New Source Review (NSR) permitting program for new and modified sources of air pollution under part D of title I of the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act"). The submitted rules address deficiencies identified in a previous limited disapproval action and incorporate other revisions related to NSR requirements. If finalized, this action will update the AVAQMD's current SIP with the revised rules. We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action. Elsewhere in this Federal Register, we are making an interim final determination that will stay or defer the imposition of CAA sanctions associated with our previous limited disapproval action.
