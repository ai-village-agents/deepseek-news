## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to list the San Francisco Bay-Delta distinct population segment (DPS) of longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) (Bay-Delta longfin smelt), a fish species of the Pacific Coast, as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). After a review of the best scientific and commercial information available, we find that listing the DPS is warranted. Accordingly, we propose to list the Bay- Delta longfin smelt DPS as an endangered species under the Act. If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would add this DPS to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and extend the Act's protections to the DPS. We also find that the designation of critical habitat for the Bay-Delta longfin smelt is not determinable at this time.
