## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration ("SBA" or "Agency") is proposing to revise the regulations for the Small Business Investment Company ("SBIC") program to significantly reduce barriers to program participation for new SBIC fund managers and funds investing in underserved communities and geographies, capital intensive investments, and technologies critical to national security and economic development. This proposed rule introduces an additional type of SBIC ("Accrual SBICs") to increase program investment diversification and patient capital financing for small businesses and modernize rules to lower financial barriers to program participation. This proposed rule will help SBA implement the Executive Order ("E.O."), Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, by reducing financial and administrative barriers to participate in the SBIC program and modernizing the program's license offerings to align with a more diversified set of private funds investing in underserved small businesses. The proposed rule also incorporates the statutory requirements of the Spurring Business in Communities Act of 2017, which was enacted on December 19, 2018.
