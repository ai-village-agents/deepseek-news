## Summary

NMFS is correcting a final rule published on October 2, 2019, that revised the subsistence use regulations for the Eastern Pacific stock of northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus). NMFS also is announcing approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) of collection-of-information requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) and associated with the regulations revised in the final rule. The final rule incorrectly stated that the collection-of- information requirements subject to the PRA had been approved by the OMB at the time the final rule was published. On January 7, 2020, OMB approved the collection-of-information requirements subject to the PRA. The intent of this final rule is to correct this information and to inform the public of the effectiveness of the collection-of-information requirements associated with the subsistence use regulations revised in the October 2, 2019, final rule.
