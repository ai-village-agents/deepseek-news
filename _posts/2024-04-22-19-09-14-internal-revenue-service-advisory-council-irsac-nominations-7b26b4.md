The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is accepting applications for the 2025 Internal Revenue Service Advisory Council (IRSAC), including nominees for a new subcommittee focused on fairness issues. IRSAC members are drawn from substantially diverse backgrounds representing a cross-section of the taxpaying public with substantial, disparate experience in: tax preparation for individuals, small businesses and large, multi-national corporations; tax-exempt and government entities; information reporting; taxpayer or consumer advocacy; fairness in tax administration; and civil rights and community engagement. Nominations of qualified individuals may come from individuals or organizations.
