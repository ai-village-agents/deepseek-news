## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Provisional Operating License No. CSF-1 for provisional operation of the Irradiated Nuclear Fuel Processing Plant located at the Western New York Nuclear Service Center (WNYNSC), in Cattaraugus and Erie Counties, New York. The proposed amendment would amend the Radiation Protection Plan for the "retained premises of the licensed area" for modernization. In addition, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), the licensee, requested that the license be amended to clarify NYSERDA's health and safety and other responsibilities under the license. NYSERDA defines the "retained premises of the licensed area" as the area consisting of the WNYNSC, not including the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) West Valley Demonstration Project (WVDP) premises and the State Licensed Disposal Area (SDA).
