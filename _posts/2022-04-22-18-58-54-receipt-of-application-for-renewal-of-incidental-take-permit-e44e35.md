## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), have received an application from Monterey Park Retail Partners, LLC, for renewal of an incidental take permit pursuant to the Endangered Species Act. The applicant has requested a renewal that will extend permit authorization by 5 years from the date the permit is reissued. The permit would authorize take of the federally threatened coastal California gnatcatcher, incidental to otherwise lawful activities associated with the low-effect habitat conservation plan (HCP) for the Monterey Park Market Place Project in Los Angeles County, California. If the permit is renewed, no additional take above the original authorized limit of up to three pairs of coastal California gnatcatcher associated with permanent removal of 2.77 acres of coastal sage scrub and 9.12 acres of mulefat scrub and ruderal vegetation within the 62- acre development area will be authorized. We invite the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies to comment on the application, which includes the applicant's current HCP. In accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), we have prepared a draft low-effect screening form supporting our preliminary determination that the proposed action qualifies for a categorical exclusion under NEPA. To make this determination, we reassessed our environmental action statement and low-effect screening form prepared for the current HCP, and this draft NEPA compliance documentation is also available for public review.
