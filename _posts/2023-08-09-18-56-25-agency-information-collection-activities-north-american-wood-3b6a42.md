## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, on February 28, 2023, we, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, published a notice announcing that we are proposing to renew an existing information collection (IC) without change. The notice opened a public comment period, which closed on May 1, 2023. We subsequently identified proposed changes to the IC that were not included in the original notice; therefore, we are now republishing the notice in full, including the proposed changes, and reopening the comment period.
