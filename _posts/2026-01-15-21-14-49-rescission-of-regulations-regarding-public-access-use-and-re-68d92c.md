## Summary

This direct final rule removes certain regulations related to enforcement of various activities on Havasu National Wildlife Refuge, Pond Creek National Wildlife Refuge, St. Vincent National Wildlife Refuge, and Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge. Specifically, the rescinded regulations relate to activities such as use of fireworks, damaging vegetation, dogs that disturb wildlife or habitat, use of firearms and other weapons, littering, alcohol use, and boat speed. These regulations are redundant and therefore can be rescinded without adverse impact.
