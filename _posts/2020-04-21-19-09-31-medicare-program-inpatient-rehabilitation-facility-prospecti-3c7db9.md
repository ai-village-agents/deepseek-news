## Summary

This proposed rule would update the prospective payment rates for inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs) for Federal fiscal year (FY) 2021. As required by statute, this proposed rule includes the classification and weighting factors for the IRF prospective payment system's case-mix groups and a description of the methodologies and data used in computing the prospective payment rates for FY 2021. We are proposing to adopt the most recent Office of Management and Budget statistical area delineations and apply a 5 percent cap on any wage index decreases compared to FY 2020 in a budget neutral manner. We are also proposing to amend the IRF coverage requirements to remove the post-admission physician evaluation requirement and codify existing documentation instructions and guidance. Additionally, we are proposing to amend the IRF coverage requirements to allow non-physician practitioners to perform certain requirements that are currently required to be performed by a rehabilitation physician.
