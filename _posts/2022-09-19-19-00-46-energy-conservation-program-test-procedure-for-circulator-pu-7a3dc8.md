## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is establishing definitions, a test procedure, sampling and rating requirements, and enforcement provisions for circulator pumps. Currently, circulator pumps are not subject to DOE test procedures or energy conservation standards. DOE is adopting a test procedure for measuring the circulator energy index for circulator pumps. The test method references the relevant industry test standard. The definitions and test procedures are based on the recommendations of the Circulator Pump Working Group, which was established under the Appliance Standards Rulemaking Federal Advisory Committee.
