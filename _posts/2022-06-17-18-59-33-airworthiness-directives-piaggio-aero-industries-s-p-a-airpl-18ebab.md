## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Piaggio Aero Industries S.p.A. (Piaggio) Model P-180 airplanes. This proposed AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as corrosion in the bottom fuselage area of the cabin compartment due to inner and outer sides of fuselage skin panels of certain airplanes treated with the less effective primer. This proposed AD would require repetitively inspecting the fuselage skin panels, visually inspecting the entire fuselage inner side skin if necessary, and taking any necessary corrective actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
