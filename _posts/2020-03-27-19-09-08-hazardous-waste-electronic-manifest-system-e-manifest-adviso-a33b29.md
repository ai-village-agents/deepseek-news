## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will convene the Hazardous Waste Electronic System ("e-Manifest") Advisory Board for a three day virtual public meeting (held remotely via webcast and phone) to seek the Board's consultation and recommendations regarding the e- Manifest system (Meeting Theme: "Reengineering Electronic Signatures for Generators and Transporters to Increase Adoption of Electronic Manifests"). This notice is a revision of the notice published in the Federal Register (FR) of February 20, 2020, announcing the e-Manifest public meeting. Due to potential impacts from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), EPA is converting this public e-Manifest Advisory Board meeting from an in-person meeting to a fully virtual meeting and is thus updating information accordingly.
