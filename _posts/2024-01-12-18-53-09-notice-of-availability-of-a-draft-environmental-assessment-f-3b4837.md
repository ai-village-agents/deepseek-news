## Summary

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) announces the availability of a draft environmental assessment (EA) to consider the potential environmental impacts associated with possible wind energy- related leasing, site assessment, and site characterization activities on the U.S. Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). This notice of availability (NOA) announces the start of the public review and comment period, as well as the dates and times for public meetings on the draft EA. After BOEM holds the public meetings and addresses public comments submitted during the review period, BOEM will publish a final EA. The EA will inform BOEM's decision whether to issue wind energy leases in the Central Atlantic Wind Energy Areas (WEAs).
