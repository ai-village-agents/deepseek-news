## Summary

On June 22, 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau or CFPB) issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) requesting information regarding credit card late fees and late payments, and card issuers' revenue and expenses. The ANPR was published in the Federal Register on June 29, 2022, and provided for a comment period that was set to close on July 22, 2022. To allow interested persons more time to gather the requested information and submit their comments, the Bureau has determined that a 10-day extension of the comment period until August 1, 2022, is appropriate.
