## Summary

This rulemaking proposes long-term school nutrition standards based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025, and feedback the U.S. Department of Agriculture received from child nutrition program stakeholders during a robust stakeholder engagement campaign. Notably, this rulemaking proposes new added sugars standards for the school lunch and breakfast programs. It also proposes gradually reducing school meal sodium limits, consistent with research recommending lower sodium intake beginning early in life to reduce children's risk of chronic disease. In addition to addressing nutrition standards, this proposes measures to strengthen the Buy American provision in the school meal programs. As described below, this document also addresses long-term milk and whole grain standards; proposes a variety of changes to school meal requirements; addresses proposals from a prior rulemaking; and makes several technical corrections to child nutrition program regulations. The U.S. Department of Agriculture expects to issue a final rule in time for schools to plan for school year 2024-2025.
