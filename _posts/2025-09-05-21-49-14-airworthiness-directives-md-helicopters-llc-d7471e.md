## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain MD Helicopters, LLC, Model 369 (Army YOH-6A), 369A (Army OH- 6A), 369D, 369E, 369F, 369FF, 369H, 369HE, 369HM, 369HS, 500N, and 600N helicopters. This AD was prompted by multiple reports of cracked tail rotor (T/R) pedal support brackets. This AD requires repetitively inspecting certain part-numbered T/R pedal support brackets and depending on the results, replacing the T/R pedal support bracket or refinishing any exposed areas. This AD also prohibits installing certain part-numbered T/R pedal support brackets. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
