## Summary

The Smith Point Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) is a vessel traffic routing measure which lies on inland waters, at the mouth of the Potomac River. The Coast Guard announces its intention to have the TSS removed from the nautical charts, and from the U.S. Coast Pilot. We will also change the buoy which identifies the TSS from a special purpose lighted yellow buoy to a red and white striped lighted mid- channel buoy.
