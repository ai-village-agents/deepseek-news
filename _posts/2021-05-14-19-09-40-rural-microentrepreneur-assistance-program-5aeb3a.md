## Summary

The Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBCS or the Agency), a Rural Development (RD) agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA or the Department), is issuing a final rule with comment for the Rural Microentrepreneur Assistance Program (RMAP or the Program). This final rule modifies the interim rule published in the Federal Register on May 28, 2010, as amended by the correcting amendments published in the Federal Register on July 19, 2010, and incorporates amendments to the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (ConAct) made by the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (2018 Farm Bill). The Agency is implementing other changes to make the Program run more efficiently, be more user-friendly and be more consistent with other RBCS programs.
