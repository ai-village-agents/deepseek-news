## Summary

The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeks comment on a proposal to amend the Commission's Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) regulations. The proposal is designed to improve readability by reorganizing and rephrasing existing content in a more accessible manner. Additionally, the proposal would better align the Commission's existing FOIA regulations with the practices of other agencies subject to the FOIA, as necessarily adapted to the Commission's size and area of regulatory oversight. Finally, the proposal includes amendments to clarify and amplify the information given to the public and improve the efficiency of the Commission's FOIA administration. This document informs the public of the filing, invites public comment, and takes other administrative steps.
