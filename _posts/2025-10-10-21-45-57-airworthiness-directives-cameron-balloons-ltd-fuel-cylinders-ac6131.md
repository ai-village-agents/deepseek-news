## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2025-11- 10, which applied to Cameron Balloons Ltd. (Cameron) fuel cylinders fitted with certain pressure relief valve (PRV) adaptors on hot air balloons. AD 2025-11-10 required repetitively visually checking the PRV adaptor for cracks and removing any fuel cylinder with a cracked PRV adaptor from service. Since the FAA issued AD 2025-11-10, a new replacement part was introduced into service. This AD retains the repetitive check and removal requirements of AD 2025-11-10 and also requires replacement of the PRV adaptor as terminating action for the repetitive checks. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
