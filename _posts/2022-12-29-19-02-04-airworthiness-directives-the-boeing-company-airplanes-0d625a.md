## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 747-400 and 747-8 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of wear-through of the motor impeller inlet adapter of a transfer pump for the horizontal stabilizer fuel tank caused by contact between the pump inlet check valve and the inlet adapter. This AD requires inspecting for wear of the motor impeller inlet check valves and inlet adapters of the transfer pumps for the horizontal stabilizer fuel tank and doing corrective actions, if necessary. This AD also limits the installation of affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
