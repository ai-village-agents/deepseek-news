## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Twin Commander Aircraft LLC (Twin Commander) Model 685, 690, 690A, 690B, 690C, 690D, 695, and 695A airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of fatigue cracking affecting structural components within the fuselage and empennage structure. This proposed AD would require inspecting certain structural components within the fuselage and vertical stabilizer for any evidence of cracks, corrosion, or loose hardware, and inspecting the working fasteners at the diagonal braces of fuselage station (FS) 386 for cracks, elongation, or deformation; and depending on the results of the inspections, replacing with new parts or used parts or repairing, as applicable; and reporting inspection results to the FAA. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
