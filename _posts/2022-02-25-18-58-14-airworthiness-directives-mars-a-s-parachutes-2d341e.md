## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain MARS A.S. emergency parachutes. This AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as the length of the ripcord between the pins being too long, which could cause a malfunction of the emergency parachute. This AD requires removing emergency parachutes with certain manufacture dates or serial numbers from service. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
