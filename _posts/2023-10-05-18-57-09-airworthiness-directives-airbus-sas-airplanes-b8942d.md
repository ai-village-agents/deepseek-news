## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A320-214, A320-216, A320-251N, A320-271N, and A321-253NX airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a quality review of the forward cargo door frame-to-fuselage skin panel assembly identified several fastener holes that deviated from the manufacturing requirements. This proposed AD would require repetitive special detailed inspections of the affected area for discrepancies and, depending on findings, accomplishment of applicable corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
