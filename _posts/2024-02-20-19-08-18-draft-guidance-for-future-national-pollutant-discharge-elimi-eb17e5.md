## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is seeking comment on this draft Guidance to clarify and inform future National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting actions for communities with combined sewer systems. This draft Guidance highlights the available approaches for permitting combined sewer overflow (CSO) communities nearing completion of the projects and activities identified in their Long-Term Control Plan (LTCP). The draft Guidance summarizes options under the Clean Water Act (CWA) that are articulated in the 1994 Combined Sewer Overflow Control Policy and the option to use the EPA's 2012 Integrated Planning Framework to look holistically at future investments in controlling wastewater and stormwater discharges and improving water quality.
