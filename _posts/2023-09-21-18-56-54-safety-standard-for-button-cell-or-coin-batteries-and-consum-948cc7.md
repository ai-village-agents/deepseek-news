## Summary

In February 2023, as required by Reese's Law, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) to eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury from ingestion of button cell or coin batteries by children six years old and younger. In the NPR the Commission preliminarily determined that no existing voluntary standard met the requirements in Reese's Law at that time. In this document, however, the Commission determines that one voluntary standard, substantially revised since publication of the NPR, now meets the requirements in Reese's Law with respect to performance and labeling requirements for consumer products containing button cell or coin batteries. Reese's Law states that after a determination of sufficiency by the Commission, such a qualifying voluntary standard is treated as a consumer product safety rule. The Commission is publishing this determination, as required by Reese's Law, as well as a direct final rule to incorporate the voluntary standard by reference into our regulations. Consumer products subject to performance and labeling requirements in this direct final rule must be tested and certified as compliant with the direct final rule.
