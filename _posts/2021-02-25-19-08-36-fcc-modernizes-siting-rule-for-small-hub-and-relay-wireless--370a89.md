## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communication's Commission ("Commission") updates its rule for over-the-air reception devices (OTARD) to expand its coverage to include hub and relay antennas that are used for the distribution of broadband-only fixed wireless services to multiple customer locations, regardless of whether they are primarily used for this purpose, provided the antennas satisfy other conditions of the OTARD rule. The Report and Order will allow fixed wireless service providers to bring faster internet speeds, lower latency, and advanced applications to rural and underserved communities in particular.
