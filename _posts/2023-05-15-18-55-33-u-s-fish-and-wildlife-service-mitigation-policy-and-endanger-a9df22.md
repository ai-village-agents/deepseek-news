## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce the revised Mitigation Policy and the Endangered Species Act (ESA) Compensatory Mitigation Policy. The revised Mitigation Policy establishes fundamental mitigation principles and provides a framework for applying a landscape-scale approach to achieve, through application of the mitigation hierarchy, no net loss of resources and their values, services, and functions resulting from proposed actions. The ESA Compensatory Mitigation Policy adopts the mitigation principles established in the Mitigation Policy, establishes compensatory mitigation standards, and provides guidance for the application of compensatory mitigation through implementation of the ESA.
