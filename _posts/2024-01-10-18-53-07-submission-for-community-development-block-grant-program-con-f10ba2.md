## Summary

HUD is proposing to revise the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and related Section 108 loan guarantee program regulations to make it easier for recipients to promote economic development and recovery in low- and moderate-income communities and support investments in underserved areas. This proposed rule also would revise provisions related to Consolidated Plan and citizen participation requirements for the CDBG program and institute quarterly reporting to improve performance with respect to timeliness. HUD is also proposing to make certain corresponding changes to the Indian Community Development Block Grant (ICDBG) program regulations to align the ICDBG program with the revisions being made to the CDBG program regulations.
