## Summary

This direct final rule extends the HUBZone map freeze mandated by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (NDAA 2018) from December 31, 2021, to June 30, 2023. The NDAA 2018 requires that certain certified HUBZone small business concerns shall maintain their HUBZone status until the HUBZone map is updated in accordance with the results of the 2020 census. SBA previously issued a rule to implement this provision and "freeze" the HUBZone map until December 31, 2021. However, SBA has learned that the data necessary to update the HUBZone map to reflect the 2020 census results will not be available to SBA until December 2022. Thus, SBA must extend the HUBZone "freeze" through June 30, 2023, which will permit SBA to process the data, update the HUBZone map, and provide adequate notice to the HUBZone small business community. This amendment is necessary to avoid public confusion about when certain HUBZone designations will be expiring.
