## Summary

The Rural Housing Service (RHS or Agency), a Rural Development (RD) agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), proposes to amend the current regulation for the Off-Farm Labor Housing (Off-FLH) program by clarifying the grant agreement term and adopting the period of performance as required by Federal award information requirements. The changes in this proposed rule are expected to clarify for applicants and grantees their obligations and requirements as Federal award recipients.
