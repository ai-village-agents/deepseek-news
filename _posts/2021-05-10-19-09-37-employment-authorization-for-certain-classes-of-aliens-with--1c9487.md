## Summary

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is withdrawing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that published on November 19, 2020. The NPRM proposed to revise DHS regulations governing employment authorization for individuals who have a final order of removal and are released from DHS custody on an order of supervision. The NPRM also proposed to amend DHS regulations to clearly indicate the employment eligibility of individuals who have been granted deferral of removal based on the United States' obligations under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT).
