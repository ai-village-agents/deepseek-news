## Summary

EPA is proposing to approve three State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision requests, submitted by Indiana, Michigan, and Minnesota. All three states submitted the SIP revision requests in 2016 in response to a finding of substantial inadequacy and a SIP call published on June 12, 2015, for specific provisions in each state's SIP related to excess emissions during startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) events. Each of these SIP submissions was submitted independently and EPA is analyzing them individually. However, EPA is packaging the proposed approvals together in a single action both for administrative efficiency and because EPA's action approving the revisions consistently applies EPA's national policy regarding SSM provisions in SIPs. EPA is proposing approval of these SIP submissions and proposing to determine that each submission corrects the state's respective SIP deficiencies as identified in the June 12, 2015, SIP call.
