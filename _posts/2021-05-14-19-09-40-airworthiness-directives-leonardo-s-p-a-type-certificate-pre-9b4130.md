## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2015-25-04 for Agusta S.p.A (now Leonardo S.p.a.) Model A109A and A109A II helicopters. AD 2015-25-04 required inspecting the slider assembly pitch control (slider) for play and replacing the slider if the play exceeds certain limits. This AD was prompted by further investigation that led to the determination that the play was caused by a manufacturing issue. This AD retains certain requirements of AD 2015- 25-04, requires replacing certain part-numbered sliders as a terminating action for the inspections, and prohibits installing the affected part on any helicopter. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
