## Summary

The Department of Energy (DOE) invites public comment on a proposed collection of information that DOE is developing for submission to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The information collection request, State Energy Program (SEP), was previously approved on August 31, 2020, under OMB Control Number 1910-5126 and its current expiration date is August 31, 2023. This ICR will include SEP Annual Appropriations and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). This ICR makes updates to the SEP reporting metrics to ensure the requested information can be shared on an annual basis with Congress.
