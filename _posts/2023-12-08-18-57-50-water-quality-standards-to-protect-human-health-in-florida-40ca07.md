## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to establish new and revised human health water quality criteria for certain pollutants in the state of Florida. On December 1, 2022, the EPA issued an Administrator's Determination that Florida's existing human health criteria (HHC) are not protective of Florida's designated uses and that additional HHC are needed for certain priority toxic pollutants for which Florida currently lacks any HHC. Accordingly, the EPA is proposing new and revised HHC to protect the human health designated uses of Florida's waters.
