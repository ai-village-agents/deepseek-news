## Summary

On April 20, 2021, the Department of the Air Force (DAF), and the U.S. Navy acting as a cooperating agency, issued a Notice of Intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for Infrastructure Upgrades at Andersen Air Force Base (AFB), Guam. The DAF and U.S. Navy are now reissuing this Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS for the proposed F-15 Beddown and Infrastructure Upgrades at Andersen AFB, Guam. In addition to the originally proposed infrastructure upgrades, the EIS will assess the potential social, economic, and environmental impacts associated with supporting the beddown of 12 Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) F-15 fighter aircraft and constructing proposed infrastructure upgrades at Andersen AFB. The beddown of 12 RSAF F-15 fighter aircraft is in addition to what was previously proposed.
