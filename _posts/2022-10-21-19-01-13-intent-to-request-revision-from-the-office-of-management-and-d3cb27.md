## Summary

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) invites public comment on one currently approved Information Collection Request (ICR), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number 1652-0046, abstracted below, that we will submit to OMB for a revision in compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected burden. The information collection involves passenger information that certain U.S. aircraft operators and foreign air carriers (collectively referred to in this document as "covered aircraft operators") submit to Secure Flight for the purposes of identifying and protecting against potential threats to transportation and national security. The information collection also involves lists used by TSA to determine the prescreening status of individuals. TSA is revising the collection to reduce the number of non-governmental entities with access to the federal watch lists.
