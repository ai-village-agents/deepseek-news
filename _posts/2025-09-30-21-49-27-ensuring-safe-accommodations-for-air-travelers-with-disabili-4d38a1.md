## Summary

This document announces that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is delaying enforcement of certain provisions of the final rule on "Ensuring Safe Accommodations for Air Travelers With Disabilities Using Wheelchairs" (Wheelchair Rule) while it engages in a new rulemaking that will consider whether to modify those provisions. As described below, this exercise of enforcement discretion applies to provisions of the Wheelchair Rule related to airline liability for mishandled wheelchairs, refresher training frequency, pre-departure notifications, and fare difference reimbursements. This exercise of enforcement discretion is intended to remove the burden of complying with requirements under review by DOT and does not prejudge the outcome of the new rulemaking. This notice does not affect the enforcement of requirements in the Wheelchair Rule beyond the four identified provisions.
