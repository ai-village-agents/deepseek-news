# Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 747-8 and -8F series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of cracking in stringers and splice fittings located at stringer splices at multiple body stations. This proposed AD would require an inspection of each free flange of the stringers at the stringer splice for the presence of radius fillers at fastener locations, an inspection for cracking of the stringers and stringer splice fittings at certain stringer splice locations, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
