## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to modify and reissue a current DHS system of records titled, "DHS/U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)-008 Search, Arrest, and Seizure Records (SAS)." ICE collects and maintains information in the SAS in order to document searches of individuals and property, arrests of individuals, and detentions and seizures of property and goods pursuant to ICE law enforcement authorities. ICE is updating this system of records notice to modify the purpose of the system; modify existing, and add new, categories of individuals; modify and update the categories of records; and update, modify, and remove routine uses. Additionally, this notice includes non-substantive changes to simplify the formatting and text of the previously published notice. All exemptions listed for this system in the existing system of records notice will continue to be applicable for this updated notice, as currently implemented in 6 CFR part 5, Appendix C. This updated system will be included in DHS's inventory of record systems.
