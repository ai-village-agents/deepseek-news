## Summary

The Drug Enforcement Administration is correcting a final rule that appeared in the Federal Register on November 25, 2020. The document issued an action placing five fentanyl-related substances (cyclopentyl fentanyl (N-(1-phenethylpiperidin-4-yl)-N- phenylcyclopentanecarboxamide), isobutyryl fentanyl (N-(1- phenethylpiperidin-4-yl)-N-phenylisobutyramide), para-chloroisobutyryl fentanyl (N-(4-chlorophenyl)-N-(1-phenethylpiperidin-4- yl)isobutyramide), para-methoxybutyryl fentanyl (N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N- (1-phenethylpiperidin-4-yl)butyramide), and valeryl fentanyl (N-(1- phenethylpiperidin-4-yl)-N-phenylpentanamide), including their isomers, esters, ethers, salts, and salts of isomers, esters, and ethers, permanently in schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, specifically to the opiates list under DEA regulations. The published document assigned incorrect paragraph numbers to all five substances, and inadvertently removed four other substances from the listed opiates.
