## Summary

The Coast Guard is modifying the operating schedule that governs the Roosevelt (US1) Bridge, across the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.5, at Stuart, FL. This action is necessary to allow the drawbridge to operate on demand, as outlined in the Record of Decision for the high-level fixed US1 Roosevelt Bridge which was constructed in 1997. Additionally, with the increase in railway activity on the adjacent railroad bridge, this modification will allow the drawbridges to operate in concert. The drawbridge name in the existing regulation is incorrect and will be changed in this Final Rule.
