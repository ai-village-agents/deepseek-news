## Summary

The Galveston District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) intends to prepare a Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) for the Matagorda Ship Channel Improvement Project consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). On April 22, 2020, the Record of Decision (ROD) was signed for the Matagorda Ship Channel Improvement Project (MSCIP), Calhoun and Matagorda Counties, TX Final Integrated Feasibility Report and Environmental Impact Statement (IFR-EIS). During the pre-construction engineering and design (PED) phase, the USACE identified a discrepancy between its PED calculations concerning the quantity of material to be dredged from the Matagorda Ship Channel and the quantity of such material that was evaluated in the IFR-EIS. Due to the discrepancy, the USACE determined a SEIS would be prepared, and the ROD dated April 22, 2020, was withdrawn for further consideration of findings in the SEIS. In accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality regulations, the USACE will prepare a SEIS to document and disclose the impacts of substantial changes to the proposed action and new information that are relevant to environmental concerns. This notice also announces the USACE intent to seek public input on the scope of the SEIS, information, or topics to be addressed, and public concerns surrounding the proposed action.
