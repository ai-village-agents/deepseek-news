## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to promulgate a Federal Clean Water Act (CWA) chronic aquatic life ambient water quality criterion for waters under the state of Idaho's jurisdiction to protect aquatic life from the effects of exposure to harmful concentrations or levels of total mercury (i.e., including methylmercury and inorganic mercury). In 2008, the EPA disapproved the state's revision of its mercury aquatic life criteria. The state has not adopted and submitted revised mercury aquatic life criteria to the EPA to address the EPA's 2008 disapproval. Therefore, the EPA is proposing a Federal mercury criterion to protect aquatic life uses in Idaho.
