## Summary

MSHA proposes to revise title 30 of the Code of Federal Regulations (30 CFR) part 56 by removing duplicative requirements for aerial tramways. Removing these provisions would not reduce protections afforded to miners because they are unnecessary and duplicative of information elsewhere in 30 CFR part 56.
