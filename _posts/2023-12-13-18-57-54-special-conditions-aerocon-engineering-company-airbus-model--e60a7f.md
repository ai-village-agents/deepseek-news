## Summary

This action proposes special conditions for the Airbus Model A330-300 series airplane. This airplane as modified by Aerocon Engineering Company (Aerocon) will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport category airplanes. This design feature is an installation of a lower deck crew rest compartment (LDCRC) under the passenger cabin floor in the cargo compartment. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These proposed special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
