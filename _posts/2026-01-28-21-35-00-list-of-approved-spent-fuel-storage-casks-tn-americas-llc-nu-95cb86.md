## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its spent fuel storage regulations by revising the TN Americas LLC, NUHOMS[supreg] Extended Optimized Storage (EOS) Dry Spent Fuel Storage System listing within the "List of approved spent fuel storage casks" to include Amendment No. 5 to Certificate of Compliance (CoC) No. 1042. Amendment No. 5 would revise the CoC to add a new heat load zone configuration for the EOS-37PTH canister, increasing the maximum heat load to 54 kW per dry shielded canister for storage in the EOS- Horizontal Storage Module and transfer using EOS-Transfer Casks TC125/ 135; clarify acceptance criteria for minor surface imperfections on high strength low-alloy basket plates in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR); and make editorial updates to the UFSAR and Technical Specification revisions to align with Amendment No. 4, improve readability, and correct code references.
