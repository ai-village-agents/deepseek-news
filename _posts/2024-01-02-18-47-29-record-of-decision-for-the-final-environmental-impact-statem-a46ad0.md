## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announces its decision to award credits to Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) under the Civil Nuclear Credit (CNC) Program for the continued operation of Diablo Canyon Power Plant Units 1 and 2 (DCPP) under DCPP's current operating licenses issued by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). This decision is pursuant to the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Civil Nuclear Credit Program Proposed Award of Credits to Pacific Gas and Electric Company for Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DOE/EIS-0555). DCPP is an existing commercial nuclear power plant located in San Luis Obispo County, California. PG&E will be eligible to receive payments from the first award cycle of funding from the CNC Program over a four-year award period (January 2023-December 2026), subject to PG&E's satisfaction of the applicable payment terms and NRC license extension approvals. The action being taken by DOE does not change the operational configuration (i.e., the way PG&E operates the plant) of the facility. The action awards credits to PG&E to help DCPP to continue to operate under the existing NRC approved licenses and programs. Payments of credits are expected to occur annually beginning in 2025 and will be paid retroactively to compensate PG&E for DCPP operations in the prior year(s).
