## Summary

This action proposes to amend Class D airspace and Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface for Greenville Mid-Delta Airport, Greenville, MS, as the Greenville Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) has been decommissioned, and associated approaches cancelled. This action would also update the airport's name, and remove Class E airspace designated as an extension to Class D airspace. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.
