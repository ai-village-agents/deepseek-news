# Authority of NTSB in Railroad, Pipeline, and Hazardous Materials Investigations

## Summary

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is publishing this advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) to seek public feedback on whether it should define the term "substantial property damage" as it relates to the agency's authority to investigate railroad accidents. Neither the agency's statute nor the regulation currently defines this term, thus, the NTSB seeks comments on whether defining "substantial property damage" would better clarify the scope of regulatory coverage for its railroad investigations. The issues raised in the comments submitted in response to this ANPRM will inform whether and how the NTSB will define this term in its regulation.
