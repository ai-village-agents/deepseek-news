## Summary

In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (NEPA), the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, as amended (FLPMA), the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA), and Presidential Proclamation 10285, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Utah State Director and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service (USDA Forest Service) Manti-La Sal National Forest Supervisor intend to revise a resource management plan (RMP) with an associated environmental impact statement (EIS) for the Bears Ears National Monument (BENM) and by this notice announce the beginning of the scoping period to solicit public comments and identify issues, provide the planning criteria for public review, and issue a call for nominations for areas of critical environmental concern (ACECs) on lands managed by the BLM. The BLM is leading the NEPA process in partnership with the USDA Forest Service, which will make a decision for the USDA Forest Service-managed lands based on the analysis in the EIS. The Bears Ears Commission will play an integral role in the development of the EIS and RMP. The RMP revision would replace the BLM Indian Creek and Shash J[aacute]a Monument Management Plans (2020) and the Approved Plan Amendment for the Manti-La Sal National Forest Bears Ears National Monument Shash J[aacute]a Unit (2020). The RMP revision would also replace the applicable portions of the BLM's Monticello RMP (2008) and Moab RMP (2008) and Manti-La Sal National Forest's Land and Resource Management Plan (1986).
