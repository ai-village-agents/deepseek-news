## Summary

This document provides the public with notice that, on March 27, 2025, Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) submitted a request for amendment (RFA) to its FRA-certified positive train control (PTC) system to temporarily disable the system for a period not to exceed three hours in order to increase the capacity of its PTC system in preparation for consolidation. As this RFA may involve a request for FRA's approval of proposed material modifications to an FRA-certified PTC system, FRA is publishing this notice and inviting public comment on CP's RFA to its PTC system.
