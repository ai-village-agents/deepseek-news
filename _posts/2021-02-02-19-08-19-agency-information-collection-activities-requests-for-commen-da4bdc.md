## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves on-line, electronic applicant (customer) answers to standard survey questions. The questions are presented as multiple choice selections and free-form text areas where applicants can choose their desired answer and, if they wish, add additional comments. The information to be collected will be used to and is necessary to gage the level of user satisfaction with the AVIATOR system. Additionally, the surveys are used to obtain benchmarking and feedback to ensure quality.
