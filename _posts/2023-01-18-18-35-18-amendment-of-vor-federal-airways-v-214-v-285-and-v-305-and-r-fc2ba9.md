This action amends VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-214, V-285, and V-305, and revokes V-96. The FAA is taking this action due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Kokomo, IN, VOR/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) navigational aid (NAVAID). The Kokomo VOR is being decommissioned in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
