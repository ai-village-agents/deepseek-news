## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of ASFBIOF01-02 polypeptide in or on all food and feed commodities if used according to the label and good agricultural practices. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), Biotalys NV submitted a petition to EPA requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of this pesticide when used in accordance with the terms of the exemption.
