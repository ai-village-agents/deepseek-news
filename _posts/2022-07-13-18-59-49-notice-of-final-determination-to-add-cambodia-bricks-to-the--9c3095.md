## Summary

This notice is a final determination to revise the list required by Executive Order No. 13126 ("Prohibition of Acquisition of Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Child Labor", hereafter the E.O. List). The E.O. List identifies a list of products, by their country of origin, that the Department of Labor (DOL), in consultation and cooperation with the Department of State (DOS) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) (collectively, the Departments), has a reasonable basis to believe might have been mined, produced, or manufactured by forced or indentured child labor. The Departments proposed adding bricks from Cambodia to the E.O. List in a Notice of Initial Determination that was published in the Federal Register on October 2, 2020. After a thorough review of the comments received and information available, the Departments have determined that the use of forced child labor in brick kilns in Cambodia has been occurring in more than isolated incidents. As a result, this product meets the criteria for inclusion in the E.O. List.
