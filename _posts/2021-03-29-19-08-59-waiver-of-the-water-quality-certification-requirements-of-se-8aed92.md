## Summary

In this final rule, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is amending its regulations pursuant to section 401(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act to establish a categorial reasonable period of time for a state or tribal certifying authority to act on a water quality certification request for proposed natural gas and liquified natural gas projects. The Commission is allowing certifying authorities up to one year after receipt of a request for water quality certification, filed in connection with a requested Commission-issued section 7 certificate of public convenience and necessity or section 3 authorization under the Natural Gas Act, to grant or deny the request.
