## Summary

The FAA is withdrawing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) and supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) that proposed to supersede airworthiness directive (AD) 72-14-08 R1 for Cessna Aircraft Company (now Textron Aviation Inc.) Models 310, 320, 401, 402, 411, and 421 airplanes. AD 72-14-08 R1 requires repetitively inspecting the fuel and oil flexible hose lines for leakage or evidence of any damaged or deteriorated hose assembly on the above-referenced airplanes and replacing any discrepant part. Since issuance of the SNPRM, the FAA has not received any reports of fuel and oil flexible hose lines that leak or are damaged and has determined that the repetitive inspections required by AD 72-14-08 R1 address the unsafe condition. Accordingly, the NPRM and SNPRM are withdrawn.
