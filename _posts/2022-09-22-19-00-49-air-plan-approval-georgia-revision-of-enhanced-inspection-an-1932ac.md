## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving changes to State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of Georgia, through the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (GA DNR), Environmental Protection Division (GA EPD), in a letter dated April 30, 2021. The revisions remove obsolete references and provisions, clarify the State's inspection and maintenance (I/M) requirements, and update terminology, in part to reflect advances in test and vehicle technology. EPA evaluated the SIP revisions and determined the changes will not impact emissions under the Georgia I/M program. EPA also determined that approval of the SIP revisions will not interfere with attainment or maintenance of any national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) or with any other applicable requirement of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act). Therefore, EPA is approving the Georgia's April 30, 2021, SIP revisions as consistent with the applicable provisions of the CAA.
