## Summary

This action amends Jet Route J-96 by removing the route segment between the Cimarron (CIM), NM, Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR)/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) and the Garden City (GCK), KS, VORTAC navigational aids (NAVAIDs). The FAA is taking this action due to the Cimarron VORTAC radials between 045[deg] and 055[deg], stated in degrees magnetic (M) north, that make up the route segment east of Cimarron, NM, being unusable since 2020.
