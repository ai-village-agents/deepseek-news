## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) received and is considering approval of one amendment request. The amendment request is for Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2. For this amendment request, the NRC proposes to determine that it involves no significant hazards consideration. Because the amendment request contains sensitive unclassified non-safeguards information (SUNSI), an order imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI for contention preparation.
