## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Diamond Aircraft Industries Inc. Model DA 62 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of baggage nets installed with defective buckles, which may result in failure of the baggage net to restrain the baggage or cargo, which could lead to injury to the occupants in the case of an emergency landing. This proposed AD would require identifying and replacing the affected part. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
