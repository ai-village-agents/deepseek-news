## Summary

Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on June 16, 2022, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of Velodyne Lidar USA, Inc., of San Jose, California. A supplement to the complaint was filed on July 1, 2022. The complaint as supplemented alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain rotating 3-D LiDAR devices, components thereof, and sensing systems containing the same by reason of the infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 7,969,558 ("the '558 patent") and U.S. Patent No. 9,983,297 ("the '297 patent"). The complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The complainant requests that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a limited exclusion order and cease and desist orders.
