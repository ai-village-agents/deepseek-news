## Summary

This regulation establishes exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid, also known as DPA (CAS Reg. No. 499-83-2), when used as an inert ingredient in antimicrobial pesticide formulations for use on food contact surfaces in public eating places, dairy processing equipment, and food processing equipment and utensils and when used in pesticide formulations applied pre- and post-harvest to crops with an end-use concentration not to exceed 2 parts per million (ppm). EcoLab Inc. submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting the establishment of such exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of DPA.
