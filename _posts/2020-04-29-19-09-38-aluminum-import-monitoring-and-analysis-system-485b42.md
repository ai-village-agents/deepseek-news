## Summary

The Department of Commerce (Commerce) is issuing, and requesting public comments on, a proposed rule to establish an Aluminum Import Monitoring And Analysis (AIM) system. Over the past decade, Commerce has operated the Steel Import Monitoring and Analysis (SIMA) system to monitor for import surges of specific steel products and to monitor for potential transshipment and circumvention of U.S. trade measures relating to these products. AIM, as proposed, will be similar to the existing SIMA system. Specifically, Commerce proposes to require import license applicants to identify the country where the aluminum used in the manufacture of the imported aluminum product was smelted and poured; to release this data on an aggregate basis, as appropriate; and to apply the licensing requirement to cover all imports of basic aluminum products, which are listed in Annex II.
