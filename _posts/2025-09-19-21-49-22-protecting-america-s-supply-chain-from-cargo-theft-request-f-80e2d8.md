## Summary

Cargo theft is a growing concern for the U.S. transportation system, costing the economy billions annually. These crimes involve opportunistic "straight thefts" of trailers, containers, and loads at truck stops or multimodal distribution hubs and highly coordinated operations conducted by organized criminal networks. Both categories create significant economic losses, disrupt supply chains, and in some cases fund broader illicit activities such as narcotics trafficking, counterfeiting, and human smuggling. DOT seeks information from State, metropolitan, and local agencies; law enforcement; industry; stakeholders (e.g., carriers, shippers, drivers, warehouse operators (including at airports), insurers); and the public to aid in the development of strategies and potential programs to reduce cargo theft, strengthen supply chain security, and create a safe operating environment for freight stakeholders and the traveling public.
