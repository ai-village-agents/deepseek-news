## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) invites public comment on its Request for Information (RFI) regarding Partnerships for Transformational Artificial Intelligence Models. The purpose of this RFI is to solicit feedback from industry, think tanks, investors, research organizations, and other stakeholders on how DOE should best structure and enable partnerships to curate DOE scientific data across the National Laboratory complex for use in artificial intelligence (AI) models. This RFI also seeks input on using this data to develop self- improving AI models for science and engineering to advance scientific discovery, energy, and national security.
