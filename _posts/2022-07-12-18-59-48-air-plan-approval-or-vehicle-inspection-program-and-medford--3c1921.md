## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving revisions to the Oregon state implementation plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Oregon (Oregon) on December 9, 2020 and December 22, 2021. The revisions update the SIP-approved vehicle inspection program for the Portland and Medford areas. The EPA is approving the SIP submittal as consistent with Clean Air Act (Act or CAA) requirements. Additionally, the EPA is making a technical correction to the Medford- Ashland particulate matter (PM<INF>10</INF>) maintenance plan that incorrectly identified a street-sweeping commitment as a transportation control measure (TCM).
