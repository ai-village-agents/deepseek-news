## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) debarring Jhanna Novikov for a period of 5 years from importing or offering for import any drug into the United States. FDA bases this order on a finding that Ms. Novikov was convicted of one felony count under Federal law for smuggling goods into the United States. The factual basis supporting Ms. Novikov's conviction, as described below, is conduct relating to the importation into the United States of a drug or controlled substance. Ms. Novikov was given notice of the proposed debarment and was given an opportunity to request a hearing to show why she should not be debarred. As of April 8, 2022 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Ms. Novikov had not responded. Ms. Novikov's failure to respond and request a hearing within the prescribed timeframe constitutes a waiver of her right to a hearing concerning this matter.
