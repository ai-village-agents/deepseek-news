## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-13-02 for Leonardo S.p.A. (Leonardo) Model A119 and AW119 MKII helicopters. AD 2020-13-02 required inspecting for movement and the tightening torque of the tail rotor (T/R) plug, the installation of the outboard and inboard faces of the T/R duplex bearing, and the condition of the T/R duplex bearing, T/R plug threads, and nut threads. Depending on the inspection results, AD 2020-13-02 required corrective actions and reporting information. This new AD retains the requirements of AD 2020- 13-02 except the reporting requirement, updates the service information, and requires repeating the inspection. This AD was prompted by Leonardo's update to the service information. The actions of this AD are intended to address an unsafe condition on these products.
