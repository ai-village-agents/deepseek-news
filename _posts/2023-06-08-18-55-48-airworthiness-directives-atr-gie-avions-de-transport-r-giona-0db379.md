## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all ATR-GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42 and ATR72 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that some batches of nose landing gear (NLG) drag brace panels (DBP) having certain part numbers were affected by a quality deficiency that was not detected in production. This proposed AD would require a measurement of the affected part and, depending on findings, accomplishment of applicable corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
