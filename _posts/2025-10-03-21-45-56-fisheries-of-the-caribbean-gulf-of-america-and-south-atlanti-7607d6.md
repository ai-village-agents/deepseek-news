## Summary

NMFS issues regulations to implement management measures described in Amendment 2 to the Fishery Management Plans (FMPs) for Puerto Rico, St. Croix, St. Thomas and St. John FMP (Amendment 2), as prepared by the Caribbean Fishery Management Council (Council). This final rule prohibits and restricts the use of certain net gear in U.S. Caribbean Federal waters and requires a descending device to be available and ready for use on vessels when fishing for federally managed reef fish species in U.S. Caribbean Federal waters. The purpose of this final rule and Amendment 2 is to protect habitats and species from the potential negative impacts associated with the use of certain net gear and to enhance the survival of released reef fish in U.S. Caribbean Federal waters.
