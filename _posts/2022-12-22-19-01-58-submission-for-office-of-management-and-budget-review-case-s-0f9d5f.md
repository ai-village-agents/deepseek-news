## Summary

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is proposing to collect qualitative data to examine innovative and promising consumer education strategies that Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) Lead Agencies are using to help families search for and select child care and early education (CCEE). This information collection aims to present an internally valid description of the experiences of up to six, purposively selected case study sites, not to promote statistical generalization to different sites or service populations.
