## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500- 1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of the failure of emergency locator transmitter (ELT) antennas. This AD requires repetitive replacements of the ELT antenna and repetitive inspections for damage of the exterior fuselage skin around the ELT antenna attachment area, as specified in a Transport Canada Civil Aviation (TCCA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
