## Summary

The Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008 (the "Ryan Haight Act") generally requires an in-person medical evaluation prior to the issuance of a prescription of controlled substances but provides an exception to this in-person medical evaluation requirement where the practitioner is engaged in the "practice of telemedicine" within the meaning of the Ryan Haight Act. These proposed regulatory changes would establish a Special Registration framework and authorize three types of Special Registration. This proposed rulemaking also provides for heightened prescription, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements. DEA believes such changes are necessary to effectively expand patient access to controlled substance medications via telemedicine while mitigating the risks of diversion associated with such expansion. A summary of this rule may be found at https://www.regulations.gov/docket/DEA-2023-0029.
