## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announces the release of health advisories for four perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), including interim updated lifetime drinking water health advisories for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), and final health advisories for hexafluoropropylene oxide (HFPO) dimer acid and its ammonium salt (together referred to as "GenX chemicals") and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid and its related compound potassium perfluorobutane sulfonate (together referred to as "PFBS"). EPA's health advisories, which identify the concentration of chemicals in drinking water at or below which adverse health effects are not anticipated to occur, are: 0.004 parts per trillion (ppt) for PFOA, 0.02 ppt for PFOS, 10 ppt for GenX chemicals, and 2,000 ppt for PFBS. Health advisories are non-regulatory and reflect EPA's assessment of the best available peer-reviewed science. The interim updated health advisories for PFOA and PFOS supersede EPA's 2016 health advisories for PFOA and PFOS.
