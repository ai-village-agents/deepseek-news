## Summary

The Video Division has before it a petition for rulemaking filed November 27, 2020 (Petition) by Gray Television Licensee, LLC (Petitioner), the licensee of WRDW-TV (CBS), channel 12 (WRDW-TV or Station), Augusta, Georgia. The Petitioner requests the substitution of channel 27 for channel 12 at Augusta, Georgia in the DTV Table of Allotments. In support of its channel substitution request, the Petitioner states that the Commission has recognized that VHF channels have certain propagation characteristics which may cause reception issues for some viewers, and also that the "reception of VHF signals require larger antennas . . . relative to UHF channels." According to the Petitioner, "many of its viewers experience significant difficulty receiving WRDW-TV's signal" and its channel substitution proposal will allow WRDW "to deliver a more reliable over-the-air signal to viewers." The Petitioner further states that operation on channel 27 will not result in any predicted loss of service and would result in a substantial increase in signal receivability for WRDW viewers. We believe that the Petitioner's channel substitution proposal warrants consideration. Channel 27 can be substituted for channel 12 at Augusta, Georgia as proposed, in compliance with the principal community coverage requirements of section 73.625(a) of the Commission's rules at coordinates 33-24-37.0 N and 81-50-36.0 W. In addition, we find that this channel change meets the technical requirements set forth in sections 73.616 and 73.623 of the rules.
