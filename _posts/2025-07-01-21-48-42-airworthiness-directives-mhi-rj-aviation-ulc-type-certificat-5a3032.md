## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all MHI RJ Aviation ULC Model CL-600-2C10 (Regional Jet Series 700, 701, & 702), CL-600-2C11 (Regional Jet Series 550), CL-600-2D15 (Regional Jet Series 705), CL-600-2D24 (Regional Jet Series 900), and CL-600-2E25 (Regional Jet Series 1000) airplanes. This AD was prompted by an engine indicating and crew alerting system (EICAS) STAB TRIM Caution message that was posted, and subsequent repair that found prematurely worn teeth on a rubber bull gear (RBG) wheel in the horizontal stabilizer trim actuator (HSTA). This AD requires an inspection for part numbers and on-condition replacement of affected RBG wheels. This AD also prohibits the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
