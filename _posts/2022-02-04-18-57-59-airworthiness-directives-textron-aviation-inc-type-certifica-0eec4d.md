## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Textron Aviation Inc. (type certificate previously held by Raytheon Aircraft Company, Hawker Beechcraft Corporation, and Beechcraft Corporation) (Textron) Model 300, 300LW, B300, and B300C airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of a timing issue where the yaw servo software can generate a motor position fault when the pilot applies rudder input at the same time the rudder boost system is activated, which disables the rudder boost function and leads to a reduced ability of the flight crew to maintain the safe flight and landing of the airplane or loss of control of the airplane. This AD requires updating the software version of the yaw servo. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
