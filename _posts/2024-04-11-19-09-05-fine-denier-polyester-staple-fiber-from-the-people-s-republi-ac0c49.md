## Summary

As a result of the determinations by the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) orders on fine denier polyester staple fiber (fine denier PSF) from the People's Republic of China (China), India, the Republic of Korea (Korea), and Taiwan and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on fine denier PSF from China and India would likely lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping and net countervailable subsidies, and material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is publishing this notice of continuation of these AD and CVD orders.
