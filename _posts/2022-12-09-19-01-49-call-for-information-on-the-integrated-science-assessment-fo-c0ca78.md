## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is preparing an Integrated Science Assessment (ISA) as part of the review of the primary (health-based) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for oxides of nitrogen. For gaseous oxides of nitrogen (i.e., oxidized nitrogen compounds), which also include nitric oxide (NO) and gases produced from reactions involving NO and NO<INF>2</INF>, the primary NAAQS are specified in terms of nitrogen dioxide (NO<INF>2</INF>). The ISA will be developed by EPA's Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment (CPHEA) within the Office of Research and Development. When final, this ISA is intended to update the previous Integrated Science Assessment for Oxides of Nitrogen--Health Criteria (EPA/600/R-15/068, 2016), published on January 28, 2016 (2016 ISA). Interested parties are invited to assist EPA in developing and refining the scientific information base for the review of the primary NO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS by submitting research studies and data that have been published in the peer-reviewed scientific literature, accepted for publication, or presented at a public scientific meeting since May 15, 2015.
