## Summary

The Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Office of Infectious Disease and HIV/AIDS Policy (OIDP) in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH) announces the draft targets for updating the Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) National Action Plan, Phase 1, Acute Care Hospitals, for public comment. The HHS Core Group of the HAI National Action Plan reviewed data pre-pandemic and between 2020 and 2021 and developed potential 5-year targets based on assumptions that current HAI rates should return to pre-pandemic baseline rates within 2 years or within 3 years when determining these 5-year targets. The HHS HAI NAP Core Group recommends 5-year targets assuming a return to pre-pandemic baseline rates within 3 years based on two fundamentals: (1) pandemic-related challenges will likely persist in upcoming years, and (2) the pandemic has caused major strains on the health care system which make a 3-year timeline to achieve pre-pandemic Standardized Infection Ratio (SIR) the most appropriate choice. The draft targets are below.
