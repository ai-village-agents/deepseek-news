## Summary

The United States Agency for International Development proposes to modify various sections of the existing System of Records Notice titled USAID-28, USAID Personnel Locator System consistent with the requirements detailed in OMB Circular A-108: Federal Agency Responsibilities for Review, Reporting and Publication Under the Privacy Act. USAID is providing notice of its intent to change the name of the system to USAID-28, Emergency Notification System, and to update various sections of the existing System of Records Notice in accordance with OMB guidance. The system will collect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) necessary to provide rapid communications regarding emergencies and urgent situations, such as office dismissal, and closure situations that impact access to USAID facilities. USAID is issuing this Notice to clarify the purpose for which the information is collected, update the authorities, and to expand upon the routine uses for the information maintained in this system. All other changes to the Notice are administrative in nature.
