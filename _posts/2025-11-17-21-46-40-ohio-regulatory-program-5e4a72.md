## Summary

We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), are approving an amendment to the Ohio regulatory program (Ohio program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). The amendment revises Ohio's regulations to remove the requirement that a coal mining permit application include either the employment identification number or the last four digits of the Social Security number of a resident agent.
