## Summary

This action reconfigures and expands the Fort Lauderdale- Hollywood International Airport, FL (FLL), Class C airspace area. The FAA is taking this action to reduce the risk of midair collisions and enhance the efficient management of air traffic operations in the FLL terminal area. This action also updates the FLL Airport Reference Point (ARP) latitude/longitude geographic coordinates to match current airspace database information. Additionally, this action revokes the Class E airspace extension to the FLL Class C airspace surface area. This action is separate and distinct from the South Florida Metroplex Project. No flight path changes are associated with this proposal.
