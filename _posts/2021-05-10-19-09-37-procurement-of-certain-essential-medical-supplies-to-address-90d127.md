## Summary

On October 23, 2020, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) issued a Temporary Final Rule (TFR) amending our regulations to allow USAID to waive "Source and Nationality" rules to provide for increased flexibility, targeting, and speed of procurement of Essential Medical Supplies required to address the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. The TFR was effective through April 30, 2021. This document reverts the amended sections to the text of those sections as they existed prior to the issuance of the TFR, with minor technical updates. This reversion to the original text is applicable upon the expiration of the TFR.
