## Summary

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is seeking comment on a proposed rule to implement section 18(a)(4) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Section 18(a)(4) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act prohibits any person from making false or misleading representations about deposit insurance or from using the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's name or logo in a manner that would imply that an uninsured financial product is insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The proposed rule would describe: The process by which the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will identify and investigate conduct that may violate section 18(a)(4) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act; the standards under which such conduct will be evaluated; and the procedures which the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will follow when formally and informally enforcing the provisions of section 18(a)(4) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Act.
