## Summary

MARAD is deleting 46 CFR parts 317, 324, 325, 326, 328, 329, 330, 332, 335, 336, 337, 338, and 339, which pertain to terms under agreements with agents. While MARAD is retaining its 46 CFR part 315 regulation addressing agency agreements and the appointment of agents, other regulations that simply provide static procedures to serve as terms of agreement are obsolete and are being rescinded because they are covered by clauses contained in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). In the more than 30 years since MARAD last updated its regulations, the development of its service agreements has benefited from the uniformity and transparency provided by FAR clauses, and MARAD has increased reliance on them.
