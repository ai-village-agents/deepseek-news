## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to remove the Puerto Rican boa (Chilabothrus inornatus, but listed as Epicrates inornatus), an endemic snake from Puerto Rico, from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife (List). This determination is based on the best available scientific and commercial data, which indicate that the species has recovered and the threats to the species have been eliminated or reduced to the point that the species no longer meets the definition of an endangered species or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). If this proposal is finalized, the Puerto Rican boa will be removed from the List and the prohibitions and conservation measures provided by the Act, particularly through sections 7 and 9, would no longer apply to the species.
