## Summary

The formula rates for the Rocky Mountain region's (RMR) Loveland Area Projects (LAP) transmission and ancillary services for RMR's costs to be recovered under the Southwest Power Pool's (SPP) Open Access Transmission Tariff (Tariff) should RMR decide to become a member of SPP, have been confirmed, approved, and placed into effect on an interim basis (Provisional Formula Rates). If RMR decides to become a member of SPP, these new formula rates under Rate Schedules LAPT-ATRR (transmission), LAPT-DCTIE-IMEU (incremental market efficiency use share), and LAPT-AS1 (scheduling, system control, and dispatch) will supersede the existing formula rates for transmission and ancillary services under Rate Schedules L-NT1, L-FPT1, L-NFPT1, L-NFJDT, L-UU1, L-AS1, L-AS2, L-AS3, L-AS4, L-AS5, L-AS6, L-AS7, and L-AS9, which expire on September 30, 2026.
