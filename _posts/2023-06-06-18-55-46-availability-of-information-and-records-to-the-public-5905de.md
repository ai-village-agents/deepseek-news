## Summary

The Social Security Administration (SSA) is proposing revisions to our existing Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) regulations to conform with the requirements of the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016. The FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 requires Federal agencies to issue regulations on procedures for disclosure of records consistent with the amendments to the FOIA by such Act. We are also proposing the reorganization of our FOIA regulation to make our FOIA procedures easier for the public to understand and use.
