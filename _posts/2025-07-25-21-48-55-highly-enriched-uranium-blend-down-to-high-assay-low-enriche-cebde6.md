## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is amending its August 5, 1996, Record of Decision (ROD) for the Disposition of Surplus Highly Enriched Uranium Final Environmental Impact Statement (DOE/EIS-0240) (hereafter referred to as the HEU EIS), and its April 19, 2022, Amended ROD for the Savannah River Site Spent Nuclear Fuel Management Environmental Impact Statement (DOE/EIS-0279) (hereafter referred to as the SRS SNF EIS). DOE now amends its previous decisions and will blend down approximately 2.2 metric tons (MT) of highly enriched uranium (HEU) to produce high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) at H-Area at the Savannah River Site (SRS). DOE anticipates this activity would begin as early as 2025 and continue approximately 2 to 4 years consistent with program and policy priorities, and funding. DOE will transport the HALEU liquid to an offsite commercial vendor for fabrication into reactor fuel for use in nuclear reactors. Because the 2.2 MT of HEU will be blended down for use in reactor fuel, it will not be sent to the SRS liquid high-level waste (HLW) management system for disposal as described in the Amended ROD for the SRS SNF EIS.
