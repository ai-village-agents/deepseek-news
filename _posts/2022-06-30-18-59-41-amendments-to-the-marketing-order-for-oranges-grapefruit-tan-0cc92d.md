## Summary

This rulemaking invites comments on proposed amendments to Marketing Order 905, which regulates the handling of oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and pummelos grown in Florida. Proposed amendments reduce the size of the Committee and quorum requirements, revise the nomination and selection processes, remove the requirement of allocating committee seats on the basis of volume from each district, and add a new section to provide the Committee authority to receive voluntary contributions for promotion and research projects. Other concurring changes to align the marketing order with proposed amendments were also recommended.
