## Summary

The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) invites comments on proposed revisions to regulations that implement the Federal Seed Act (FSA). The proposals include revisions to seed labeling, testing, and certification requirements. The proposed revisions would add certain seed species to the lists of covered kinds of seed and update the lists to reflect current scientific nomenclature; update regulations related to seed quality, germination and purity standards, and acceptable seed testing methods; and update seed certification and recertification requirements, including new eligibility standards and the recognition of current breeding techniques. AMS intends to align FSA regulations with current industry practices, harmonize FSA testing methods with industry standards, and clarify confusing or contradictory language in the existing regulations. AMS expects the proposed revisions to reduce trade burden associated with interstate seed commerce and encourage compliance with State and Federal laws.
