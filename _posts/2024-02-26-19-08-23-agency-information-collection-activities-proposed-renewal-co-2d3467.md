## Summary

As part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, FinCEN invites comment on a renewal, without change, of existing information collection requirements related to beneficial ownership requirements for legal entity customers. Under Bank Secrecy Act regulations, covered financial institutions are required to collect, and to maintain records of, the information used to identify and verify the identity of each beneficial owner of their legal entity customers, subject to certain exclusions and exemptions. This request for comment is made pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA).
