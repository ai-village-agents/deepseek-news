## Summary

FMCSA amends its regulatory guidance to explain that FMCSA's current statutory authorities and regulations do not prohibit third party testers from administering the commercial driver's license knowledge tests for all classes and endorsements. SDLAs may accept the results of knowledge tests administered by third party testers in accordance with existing knowledge test standards and requirements set forth in 49 CFR part 383, subparts G and H.
