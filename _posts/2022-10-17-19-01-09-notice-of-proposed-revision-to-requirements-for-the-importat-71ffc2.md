# Notice of Proposed Revision to Requirements for the Importation of Grapes From Chile Into the United States

## Summary

We are advising the public that we have prepared a pest risk assessment (PRA) and a commodity import evaluation document (CIED) relative to the importation into the United States of fresh table grapes from regions of Chile where European grapevine moth (Lobesia botrana, EGVM) is either absent or at very low prevalence. Chile grapes are currently subject to methyl bromide fumigation for EGVM and Chilean false red mite (Brevipalpus chilensis). Based on the PRA and the findings of the CIED, we are also proposing to authorize the importation of grapes from Chile under a systems approach or irradiation for EGVM and B. chilensis; current mitigation measures for Ceratitis capitata, or Medfly, would remain unchanged. We are making the PRA and CIED available to the public for review and comment.
