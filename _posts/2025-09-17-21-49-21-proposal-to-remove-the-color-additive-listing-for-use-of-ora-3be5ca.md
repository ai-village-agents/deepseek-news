## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is proposing to issue an order that would remove the color additive regulation that allows for the use of Orange B for coloring the casings or surfaces of frankfurters and sausages. Based on certification data, it appears that Orange B is no longer used for coloring the casings or surfaces of frankfurters and sausages and has not been certified for use as a color additive in food marketed in the United States since 1978. Because the authorized use of Orange B appears to have been abandoned, we have tentatively concluded that this color additive regulation is outdated and unnecessary.
