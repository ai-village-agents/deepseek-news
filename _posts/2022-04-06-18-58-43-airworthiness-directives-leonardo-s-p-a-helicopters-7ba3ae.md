## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Leonardo S.p.a. Model AW109SP helicopters. This AD was prompted by reports of corrosion inside the hoist support assembly (boom assembly) (affected part) that affects both the huck bolt heads (blind bolt fasteners) and the support surface. This AD requires repetitive inspections of the external and internal surfaces of each affected part for cracking and corrosion and, depending on the findings, accomplishment of corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
