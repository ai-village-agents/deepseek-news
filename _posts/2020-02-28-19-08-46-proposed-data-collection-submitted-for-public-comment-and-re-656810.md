## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled "Distribution of Traceable Opioid Material* Kits (TOM Kits*) across U.S. Laboratories." CDC will use a brief web-based survey to collect information from laboratories submitting requests for TOM Kits*. CDC will use this information to prioritize which laboratories will receive kits when quantities are limited. * TRACEABLE OPIOID MATERIAL, TOM KITS, and the TOM KITS logo are marks of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
