## Summary

NHTSA published a final rule on December 18, 2024, in response to a mandate of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act) to establish the appropriate recording period in NHTSA's Event Data Recorder (EDR) regulation (49 CFR part 563). The final rule amended the pre-crash data capture requirements of EDRs by increasing the recording duration and sample rate from 5 seconds at 2 Hz to 20 seconds at 10 Hz. The agency received three petitions for reconsideration from the Alliance of Automotive Innovation, the EDR Committee of SAE International, and FCA US LLC (a subsidiary of Stellantis N.V.) in response to the final rule. NHTSA is proposing to delay the compliance date from September 1, 2027, to September 1, 2028, and implement a phase-in period for EDRs to meet the new requirements.
