## Summary

The Coast Guard announces that the Chief, Prevention Division, Thirteenth District has issued a certificate of alternative compliance from the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), for the DELTA MARINE INDUSTRIES SHIPYARD HULL #090049. We are issuing this notice because its publication is required by statute. Due to the construction and placement of the masthead light, DELTA MARINE INDUSTRIES SHIPYARD HULL #090049 cannot fully comply with the light, shape, or sound signal provisions of the 72 COLREGS without interfering with the vessel's design and construction. This notification of issuance of a certificate of alternative compliance promotes the Coast Guard's marine safety mission.
