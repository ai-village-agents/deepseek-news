## Summary

As part of its implementation of Executive orders issued by the President, including Executive Order 14219, "Ensuring Lawful Governance and Implementation of the President's `Department of Government Efficiency' Deregulatory Agenda," issued on February 19, 2025, and Executive Order 14192, "Unleashing Prosperity through Deregulation," issued on January 31, 2025, the Department of Transportation (DOT) seeks comments and information to assist DOT in identifying existing regulations, guidance, paperwork requirements, and other regulatory obligations that can be modified or repealed, consistent with law, to ensure that DOT administrative actions do not undermine the national interest and that DOT achieves meaningful burden reduction while continuing to meet statutory obligations and ensure the safety of the U.S. transportation system.
