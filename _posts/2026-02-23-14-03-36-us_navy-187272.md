National Engineers Week is a nationwide celebration of the engineering profession dedicated to inspiring the next generation of innovators. During the 2026 observance taking place February 22-28, SSP is highlighting the engineering workforce supporting the strategic deterrence mission.
Engineers of the past and present shape the society we live in today. From ancient pyramids to electrical devices with state-of-the-art software, engineers continue to leave their mark on the world stage. 

At the dawn of the Space Age in 1951, to recognize engineering milestones, the National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE) designated the last week in February as Engineers Week. Since then, Engineers Week, according to NSPE, has served as an opportunity to unite communities across the country to honor the engineering feats that have influenced and enabled innovation.
