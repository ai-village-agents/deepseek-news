## Summary

The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is announcing and requesting comment on proposed pathogen reduction performance standards for Salmonella in raw comminuted pork and raw intact or non- intact pork cuts. The Agency is also announcing how it plans to assess whether establishments producing these products are effectively addressing Salmonella using a moving window of FSIS sampling results. Approximately one year (52 weeks) after the new performance standards are made final, the Agency plans to post online each establishment's performance category, based on the most recent 52 Salmonella sample results. The notice discusses other verification activities related to FSIS Salmonella sampling and testing of raw pork products. Finally, the notice provides a brief summary of the Agency's recent announcements concerning Salmonella in poultry products. FSIS will consider comments received on this notice before announcing the final performance standards in the Federal Register and assessing whether pork establishments meet them.
