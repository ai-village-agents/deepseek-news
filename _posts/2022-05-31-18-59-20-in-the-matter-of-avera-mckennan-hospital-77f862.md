## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing a Confirmatory Order to Avera McKennan and Avera McKennan/Nuclear Medicine (collectively known as Avera McKennan) to document commitments made as part of a settlement agreement made between the NRC and Avera McKennan following an alternative dispute resolution mediation session held on April 20, 2022. The mediation addressed two apparent violations involving Avera McKennan's willful failure to accurately determine and record the activity of each dosage before medical use and the failure to maintain required information that was complete and accurate. Avera McKennan has committed to various measures intended to restore its ability to accurately measure dose activity, monitor the performance of its nuclear medicine technologists, and to train its employees and contractors on the NRC enforcement actions that may result from deliberate misconduct. The Confirmatory Order is effective upon issuance.
