## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of malic acid when used as an inert ingredient (buffering and stabilizing agent) on growing crops. Valent BioSciences, LLC, submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of malic acid, when used in accordance with the terms of these exemptions.
