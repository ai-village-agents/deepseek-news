## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) published notice in the Federal Register of June 3, 2022, in which Commerce announced the amended final results of the 2015-2016 administrative review of the antidumping duty (AD) order on certain passenger vehicle and light truck tires (passenger tires), following a final decision by the U.S. Court of International Trade which was not in harmony with the underlying final results of that review. In that notice, Commerce incorrectly labeled the headers of two tables setting forth the weighted-average dumping margins applicable in the amended final results as "Producer/Exporter," instead of labeling them as "Exporter." In addition, Commerce incorrectly separated certain entities in the first table, instead of listing them together. We are correcting these inadvertent errors with this notice, as described below.
