## Summary

On December 16, 2019, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) published in the Federal Register a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Notice) that proposed to revise the existing regulations requiring persons convicted of certain criminal offenses to obtain prior written consent before participating in the conduct of the affairs of any depository institution to incorporate the FDIC's existing Statement of Policy, and to amend the regulations setting forth the FDIC's procedures and standards applicable to an application to obtain the FDIC's prior written consent. The FDIC has determined that an extension of the comment period until March 16, 2020, is appropriate.
