## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for a new information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on October 25, 2021. The deadline for submission of public comments expired on December 27, 2021. No public comments were provided. The Department of Transportation (DOT or Department) further invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) approval for an information collection for the Department's Airport Concession Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (ACDBE) program. The DOT has the important responsibility of ensuring that firms competing for concession opportunities are not disadvantaged by unlawful discrimination. The DOT's most important tool for meeting this requirement has been its ACDBE program which is regulated by 49 CFR part 23 (ACDBE regulation) and is mandated by 49 U.S.C. 47107(e), originally enacted in 1987 and amended in 1992. The information collections described in this notice are necessary to maintain successful implementation of the ACDBE program, as it helps ensure recipients that receive Federal financial assistance from the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) do not discriminate in the provision of opportunities for disadvantaged business enterprises in airport concessions. We are required to publish this notice in the Federal Register by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, Public Law 104-13 (PRA).
