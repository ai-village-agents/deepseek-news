## Summary

EPA is finalizing a rule under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to amend the Chemical Data Reporting (CDR) requirements. The CDR rule requires manufacturers (including importers) of certain chemical substances listed on the TSCA Chemical Substance Inventory (TSCA Inventory) to report data on chemical manufacturing, processing, and use every four years. EPA is finalizing several changes to the CDR rule to make regulatory updates that align with new statutory requirements of TSCA, to improve the CDR data collected as necessary to support the implementation of TSCA, and potentially to reduce burden for certain CDR reporters. In addition, these regulatory modifications may result in additional information to EPA and the public that is currently not collected; improve the usability and reliability of the reported data; and ensure that data are available in a timely manner.
