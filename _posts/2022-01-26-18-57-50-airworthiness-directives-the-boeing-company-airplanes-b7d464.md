## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-800 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by the determination that insufficient sealing may allow water to enter the lower lobe electronic equipment (EE) bay through the main deck floor structure at the rigid cargo barrier (RCB), which could cause damage to EE bay line replacement units (LRUs) in the E5 rack. This proposed AD would require detailed inspections for the presence and condition of sealant at certain locations and applicable on-condition actions. This proposed AD would also require replacing the moisture barrier tape at a certain location, replacing the weather seal at a certain location, and installing seat track fillers. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
