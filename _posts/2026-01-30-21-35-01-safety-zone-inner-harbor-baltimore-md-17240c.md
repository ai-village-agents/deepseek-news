## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for certain navigable waters of the Inner Harbor in Baltimore, MD. The safety zone is needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards created during an Air Show. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port, Sector Maryland-National Capital Region, or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
