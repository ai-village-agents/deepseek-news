## Summary

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission or CPSC) published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) in September 2023 to address the risk of death and injury associated with infant suffocations, entrapments, falls, and other hazards associated with nursing pillows. CPSC is announcing the availability of, and seeking comment on, details about incident data relevant to the rulemaking that are associated with infants and the use of nursing pillows. The Commission is also seeking comments on how a final rule should address nursing pillow covers.
