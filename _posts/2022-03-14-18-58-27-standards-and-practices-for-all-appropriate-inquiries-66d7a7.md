## Summary

EPA is proposing to amend the Standards and Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries to reference a standard practice recently made available by ASTM International, a widely recognized standards development organization. Specifically, EPA is proposing to amend the All Appropriate Inquiries Rule to reference ASTM International's E1527- 21 "Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessments: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Process" and allow for its use to satisfy the requirements for conducting all appropriate inquiries under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. In the "Rules and Regulations" section in this issue of Federal Register, EPA is amending the All Appropriate Inquiries Rule to reference ASTM International's E1527-21 standard practice as a direct final rule without a prior proposed rule. If we receive no adverse comment, we will not take further action on this proposed rule.
