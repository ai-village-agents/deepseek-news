## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is granting a color additive petition submitted by Center for Science in the Public Interest, et al., by repealing the color additive regulations that permit the use of FD&C Red No. 3 in foods (including dietary supplements) and in ingested drugs. The petitioners provided data demonstrating that this additive induces cancer in male rats. Therefore, FDA is revoking the authorized uses in food and ingested drugs of FD&C Red No. 3 in the color additive regulations.
