## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that an incorrect low-pressure distribution supply duct may be installed in the forward cargo compartment. This proposed AD would require an inspection of the low-pressure distribution supply duct to determine the part number, and replacement if necessary, as specified in a Transport Canada Civil Aviation (TCCA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
