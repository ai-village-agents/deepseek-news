## Summary

The Department of Energy (DOE) Office of State and Community Energy Programs (SCEP) intends to issue an Administrative and Legal Requirements Document (ALRD) for the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant (EECBG) Program, as authorized by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) of 2021. DOE has released a Notice of Intent (NOI) through the EECBG Program website so that interested parties are aware of SCEP's intention to issue an ALRD in the near term. All the information contained in the NOI is subject to change. In addition, the NOI provides information on the EECBG Program, including draft funding allocations to states, local governments, and Indian tribes and the potential option for formula grant recipients to select a voucher in lieu of a formula grant. The NOI provides additional details on eligibility requirements and information on submission and registration requirements for formula grant recipients.
