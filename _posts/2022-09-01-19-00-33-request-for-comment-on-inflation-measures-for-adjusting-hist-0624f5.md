## Summary

The Census Bureau is seeking comments on the use of alternative price indices to adjust dollar-denominated income values to reflect changes in the price level over time (inflation adjustment). Currently, historical estimates of income and earnings are inflation- adjusted using the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers Research Series (R-CPI-U-RS) produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Census Bureau is considering adopting alternative chain-type price indices produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) for the inflation adjustment in the future. Based on comments received, the Census Bureau will weigh the advantages and disadvantages of these alternative price indices in choosing the optimal index for inflation adjustment.
