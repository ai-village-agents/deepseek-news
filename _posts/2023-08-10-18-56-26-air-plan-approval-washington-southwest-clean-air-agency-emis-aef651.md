## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to approve a revision to the Washington State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the Southwest Clean Air Agency (SWCAA) jurisdiction as it relates to the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard. This proposed revision updates SWCAA's requirements in the SIP for Stage I and Stage II vapor recovery systems at gasoline dispensing facilities including: decommissioning existing Stage II systems incompatible with onboard refueling vapor recovery systems on or before January 1, 2023; allowing removal from service of Stage II vapor recovery equipment compatible with onboard refueling vapor recovery on or after January 1, 2023; and removing the requirement for Stage II vapor recovery at new installations. The proposed revisions to the SIP also include, among other changes, revised requirements for installation of enhanced conventional nozzles, installation of low permeation hoses, and annual testing based on facility throughput. SWCAA's submittal, in coordination with the Washington Department of Ecology, incudes a demonstration that such removal of Stage II requirements is consistent with the Clean Air Act and EPA guidance.
