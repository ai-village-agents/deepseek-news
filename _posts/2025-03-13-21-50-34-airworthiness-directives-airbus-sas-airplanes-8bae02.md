## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-27-01, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and - 1041 airplanes. AD 2022-27-01 requires replacing affected fasteners and applying additional head nut cap protection at the front and rear spars in the center wing box (CWB). Since the FAA issued AD 2022-27-01, the FAA determined that additional Airbus SAS Model A350 manufacturer serial numbers (MSNs) are affected by the same potential unsafe condition. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2022-27-01 and would expand the applicability to include the additional Airbus SAS Model A350 MSNs, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
