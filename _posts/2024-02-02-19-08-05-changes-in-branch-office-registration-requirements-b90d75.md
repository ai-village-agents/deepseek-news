## Summary

The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing--Federal Housing Commissioner is issuing final regulations to amend the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) requirement for branch office registration. The final rule removes the requirement that lenders and mortgagees register each branch office where they conduct FHA business with HUD. After considering public comments received in response to the proposed rule HUD published on March 1, 2023, this final rule adopts the proposed rule without change.
