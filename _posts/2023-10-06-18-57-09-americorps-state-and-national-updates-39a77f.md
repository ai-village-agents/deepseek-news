## Summary

The Corporation for National and Community Service (operating as AmeriCorps) proposes to revise its regulations governing the AmeriCorps State and National program. This proposed rule would make four substantive changes to the regulations governing the AmeriCorps State and National program to provide programmatic and grantmaking flexibilities. Specifically, this proposed rule would: limit AmeriCorps State and National grantees' required share of program costs (known as "match" or "cost share") to a scale that starts at 24 percent for the first three-year grant cycle and increases more incrementally with each successive three-year grant cycle, until it reaches 50 percent in the sixth three-year grant cycle (that is, the sixteenth year of the grant) and beyond; simplify the criteria that allow AmeriCorps to waive match for AmeriCorps State and National grantees; allow AmeriCorps to grant waivers of education hour limitations under certain circumstances to permit AmeriCorps State and National AmeriCorps members to spend an increased number of hours on education and training activities; and remove the four-term limit on service in AmeriCorps State and National programs, instead referring to the limitation on total value of the Segal Education Awards (education awards) a member may earn. The main non-substantive change in this proposed rule updates nomenclature to reflect that the Corporation for National and Community Service operates as AmeriCorps.
