## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), affirm the listing of the streaked horned lark (Eremophila alpestris strigata), a bird subspecies from Washington and Oregon, as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). We also revise the rule issued under section 4(d) of the Act ("4(d) rule") for this bird. This final rule maintains this species as a threatened species on the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and continues to extend the protections of the Act to the species.
