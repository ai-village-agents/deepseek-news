## Summary

The Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation (OPRE) in the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), requests Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to extend approval of the ACF Behavioral Interventions to Advance Self-Sufficiency Next Generation (BIAS-NG) Project Overarching Generic (OMB #: 0970-0502; Expiration date: 8/31/ 2022). Under this overarching generic, ACF collects data as part of rapid cycle testing and evaluation, in order to inform the design of interventions informed by behavioral science and to better understand the mechanisms and effects of such interventions. Interventions have been and will continue to be developed in the program area domains of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), child welfare, and Early Head Start/Head Start (EHS/HS). These interventions are intended to improve outcomes for participants in these programs. No changes are proposed.
