## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), have received an application from the Ramona Municipal Water District (applicant) for a 4-year incidental take permit for the endangered Stephens' kangaroo rat and arroyo toad pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). We are requesting comments on the permit application and on the preliminary determination that the proposed habitat conservation plan (HCP) qualifies as a "low-effect" HCP, eligible for a categorical exclusion under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended. The basis for this determination is discussed in the environmental action statement and the associated low-effect screening form, which are also available for public review.
