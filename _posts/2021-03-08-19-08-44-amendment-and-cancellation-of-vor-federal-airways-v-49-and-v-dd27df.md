## Summary

This action modifies VHF Omni-directional Range Federal airway V-541 and removes V-49, in the vicinity of Decatur, AL. This action is necessary due to the planned decommissioning of the Decatur, AL, VOR/ Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) navigation aid, which provides navigation guidance for segments of the routes. This will provide for the safe and efficient use of navigable airspace within the National Airspace System (NAS) while reducing NAVAID dependencies throughout the NAS as part of the FAA VOR Minimum Operation Network program.
