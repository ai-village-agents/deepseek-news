## Summary

As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act, the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is submitting the new, proposed information collection to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB): NCUA Speaker and Chairman Request Forms.

As part of its collaboration efforts, the NCUA receives requests annually for NCUA leadership and staff to participate in speaking engagements at various events. This digital collection of information is necessary to ensure an efficient and timely process to schedule outreach and engagement with NCUA stakeholders.
