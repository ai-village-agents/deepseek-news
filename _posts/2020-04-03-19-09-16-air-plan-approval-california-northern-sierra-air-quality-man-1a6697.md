## Summary

On January 15, 2020, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published in the Federal Register a final rule entitled "Air Plan Approval; California; Northern Sierra Air Quality Management District; Reasonably Available Control Technology." That publication inadvertently listed in the regulatory text the wrong document number for a document entitled "Control Techniques Guidelines for the Oil and Natural Gas Industry." This document corrects this error in the regulatory text.
