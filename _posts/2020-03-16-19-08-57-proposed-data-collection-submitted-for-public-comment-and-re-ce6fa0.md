## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled School Health Profiles Test- Retest Reliability Study. CDC is requesting a one-year approval to conduct the School Health Profiles Test-Retest Reliability Study, a study to test the reliability of the data collected through the School Health Profiles questionnaires administered by state and local agencies to principals and lead health education teachers in public secondary schools containing at least one of grades 6 through 12 in the United States.
