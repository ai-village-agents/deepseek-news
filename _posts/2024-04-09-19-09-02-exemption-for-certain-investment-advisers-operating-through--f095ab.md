## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC" or "Commission") is adopting amendments to the rule under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 that exempts certain investment advisers that provide advisory services through the internet ("internet investment advisers") from the prohibition on Commission registration, as well as related amendments to Form ADV. The amendments are designed to modernize the rule's conditions to account for the evolution in technology and the investment advisory industry since the initial adoption of the rule in 2002.
