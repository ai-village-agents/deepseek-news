## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) debarring Brian Michael Parks for a period of 5 years from importing or offering for import any article of food (including dietary supplements) or drug into the United States. FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Parks was convicted of one felony count under Federal law for distribution of an unapproved new drug with the intent to defraud and mislead. The factual basis supporting Mr. Parks' conviction, as described below, is conduct relating to the importation into the United States of any food and of any drug or controlled substance. Mr. Parks was given notice of the proposed debarment and was given an opportunity to request a hearing to show why he should not be debarred. As of November 17, 2021 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Mr. Parks had not responded. Mr. Parks' failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this matter.
