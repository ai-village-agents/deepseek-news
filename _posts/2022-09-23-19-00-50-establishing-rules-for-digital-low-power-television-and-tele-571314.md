## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission or FCC) adopts several rule updates to otherwise outdated rules for low power television and TV translator stations following the July 13, 2021, transition from analog to digital operations. This final rule deletes or revises rules that no longer have any practical effect given the completion of the low power television (LPTV)/translator digital transition, or that are otherwise obsolete or irrelevant. In addition, this final rule makes certain ministerial changes, for example, to delete analog rules, and to add definitions and other information previously adopted in rulemaking proceedings but inadvertently omitted from the rules.
