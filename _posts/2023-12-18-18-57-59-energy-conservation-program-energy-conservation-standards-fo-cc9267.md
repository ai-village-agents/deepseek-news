## Summary

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended ("EPCA"), prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment, including consumer furnaces. EPCA also requires the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE" or "the Department") to determine periodically whether more stringent standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would result in significant energy savings. In this final rule, DOE is adopting amended energy conservation standards for consumer furnaces, specifically non-weatherized gas furnaces and mobile home gas furnaces. The Department has determined that the amended energy conservation standards for the subject products would result in significant conservation of energy, and are technologically feasible and economically justified.
