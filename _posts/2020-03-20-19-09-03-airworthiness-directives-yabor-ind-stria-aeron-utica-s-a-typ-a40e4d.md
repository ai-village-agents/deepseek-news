## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Yabor[atilde] Ind[uacute]stria Aeron[aacute]utica S.A. (Type Certificate Previously Held by Embraer S.A.) Model ERJ 190-100 STD, - 100 LR, -100 ECJ, -100 IGW, -200 STD, -200 LR, and -200 IGW airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of erroneous indications of certain engine parameters and reports of "pitch up" and "pitch down" uncommanded attitudes with autopilot engaged in cruise flight. This AD requires installing updated PRIMUS EPIC LOAD software, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) Brazilian AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
