## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to determine that the West Pinal County, Arizona nonattainment area did not attain the 1987 24-hour national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or "standard") for particulate matter with a diameter of ten micrometers or smaller (PM<INF>10</INF>) by December 31, 2018, the statutory attainment date for the nonattainment area. This proposal is based on the EPA's calculation of the PM<INF>10</INF> design value for the nonattainment area over the 2016-2018 period, using complete, quality-assured, and certified PM<INF>10</INF> monitoring data. If the EPA makes a final determination that West Pinal County has failed to attain the PM<INF>10</INF> NAAQS by its attainment date, then Clean Air Act (CAA) section 188(b)(2) requires that the nonattainment area be reclassified to Serious by operation of law. Within 18 months from the effective date of a reclassification to Serious, the State must submit State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions that comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements for Serious PM<INF>10</INF> nonattainment areas.
