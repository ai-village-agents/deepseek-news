## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all MHI RJ Aviation ULC Model CL-600-2C10 (Regional Jet Series 700, 701 & 702), CL-600-2C11 (Regional Jet Series 550), CL-600-2D15 (Regional Jet Series 705), CL-600-2D24 (Regional Jet Series 900), and CL-600-2E25 (Regional Jet Series 1000) airplanes. This AD was prompted by a manufacturing quality escape concerning the installation of the Halon metering device on certain cargo fire extinguisher containers. This AD requires the inspection of cargo fire extinguisher container serial numbers and the replacement of the affected containers. This AD would also limit the installation of affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
