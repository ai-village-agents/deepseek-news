## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) has completed its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on certain cased pencils (cased pencils) from the People's Republic of China (China) for the period of review (POR) December 1, 2020, through November 30, 2021. We continue to find that the single entity Wah Yuen Stationery Co. Ltd./Shandong Wah Yuen Stationery Co. Ltd. (Wah Yuen) had no shipments of cased pencils during the POR. We also continue to find that Tianjin Tonghe Stationery Co., Ltd. (Tianjin Tonghe) and Ningbo Homey Union Co., Ltd. (Ningbo Homey) are not eligible for a separate rate and should be treated as part of the China-wide entity.
