## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve two state implementation plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. These revisions address certain reasonably available control technology (RACT) requirements, including those related to Control Technique Guidelines (CTGs) for volatile organic compounds (VOC) and the addition of regulations controlling VOC emissions from industrial cleaning solvents. These submissions are part of Pennsylvania's efforts to implement RACT for the 2008 ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS). This action is being taken under the Clean Air Act (CAA).
