## Summary

Restoring competition in the American technology sector is a critical priority of the President's Executive order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy. On behalf of the U.S. Department of Commerce, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is requesting comments on competition in the mobile application ecosystem. The data gathered through this process will be used to inform the Biden-Harris Administration's competition agenda, including, but not limited to, the Department of Commerce's work developing a report to submit to the Chair of the White House Competition Council regarding the mobile application ecosystem.
