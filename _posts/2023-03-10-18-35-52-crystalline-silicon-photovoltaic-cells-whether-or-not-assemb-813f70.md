## Summary

The Department of Commerce (Commerce) published a notice in the Federal Register, in which it amended the final results of the 2017-2018 administrative review of the antidumping duty order on crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells, whether or not assembled into modules, (solar cells and modules) from the People's Republic of China (China) pursuant to a final judgment by the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT). That notice contains incorrect weighted-average dumping margins for two company groupings.
