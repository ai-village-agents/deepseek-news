## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-14- 14, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, - 212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2017-14-14 required repetitive inspections for cracking in the cabin floor beam junction at certain fuselage frame locations and repair if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2017-14-14, further analysis determined that the compliance times for the inspections must also be based on flight hours. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2017-14-14, revises compliance times, and adds a provision for optional modifications. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
