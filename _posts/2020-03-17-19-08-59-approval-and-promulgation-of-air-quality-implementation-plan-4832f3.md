## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a state implementation plan (SIP) revision formally submitted by the Commonwealth of Virginia. Whenever EPA promulgates a new or revised national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS or standard), the Clean Air Act (CAA) requires states to make SIP submissions to provide for the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of the NAAQS. These infrastructure requirements are designed to ensure that the structural components of each state's air quality management program are adequate to meet the state's responsibilities under the CAA. EPA is approving Virginia's submittal addressing the following infrastructure elements, or portions thereof, of section 110(a)(2) of the CAA for the 2015 ozone NAAQS: CAA section 110(a)(2)(A), (B), (C), (D)(i)(II), (D)(ii), (E), (F), (G), (H), (J), (K), (L), and (M). EPA is approving Virginia's submittal as a SIP revision in accordance with the requirements of section 110(a) of the CAA.
