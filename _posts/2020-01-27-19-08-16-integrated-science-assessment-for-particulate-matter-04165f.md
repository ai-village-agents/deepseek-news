## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the availability of a final document titled, "Integrated Science Assessment for Particulate Matter" (EPA/600/R-19/188). The document was prepared by the Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment (CPHEA) within EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) as part of the review of the primary (health-based) and secondary (welfare-based) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter (PM) and represents an update of the 2009 Integrated Science Assessment (ISA) for PM. The welfare-based effects evaluated consist of non-ecological effects, specifically visibility impairment, climate effects, and effects on materials. The ISA provides the scientific basis for EPA's decisions, in conjunction with additional technical and policy assessments, on the adequacy of the current NAAQS and the appropriateness of possible alternative standards. EPA is currently developing a separate ISA to support the secondary NAAQS review for ecological effects for oxides of nitrogen, oxides of sulfur, and particulate matter.
