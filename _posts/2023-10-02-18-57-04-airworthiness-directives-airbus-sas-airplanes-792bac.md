## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A330-200 series airplanes; Model A330-200 Freighter series airplanes; Model A330-300 series airplanes; Model A330-800 series airplanes; Model A330-900 series airplanes; Model A340-200 series airplanes; and Model A340-300 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of cracks found in the fuel control unit housing assembly of a Honeywell GTCP331-350 auxiliary power unit (APU), which caused fuel leakage in the APU compartment. This AD requires replacing any affected APU fuel control unit or affected APU, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also prohibits the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
