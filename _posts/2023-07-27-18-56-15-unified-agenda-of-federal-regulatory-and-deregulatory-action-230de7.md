## Summary

The following agenda of the National Labor Relations Board is published in accordance with Executive Order 12866, "Regulatory Planning and Review," and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601-612, as amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act. The complete Unified Agenda is available online at www.reginfo.gov. Publication in the Federal Register is mandated only for regulatory flexibility agendas required under the RFA. Because the RFA does not require regulatory flexibility agendas for the regulations proposed and issued by the Board, the Board's agenda appears only on the internet at www.reginfo.gov. The Board's agenda refers to www.regulations.gov, the Government website at which members of the public can find, review, and comment on Federal rulemakings that are published in the Federal Register and open for comment.
