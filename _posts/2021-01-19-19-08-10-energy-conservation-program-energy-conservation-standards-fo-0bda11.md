# Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Small Electric Motors

## Summary

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended ("EPCA"), prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment, including small electric motors ("SEMs"). EPCA also requires the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") to periodically determine whether more-stringent standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would result in significant conservation of energy. In this final determination, DOE has determined that more stringent SEMs standards would not be cost effective, and thus has determined that standards for SEMs should not be amended.
