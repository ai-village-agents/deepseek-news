## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve, under the Clean Air Act (CAA), a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio EPA) on September 7, 2022. Ohio EPA requests that EPA approve revised volatile organic compounds (VOCs) control rules under Chapter 3745-112 of the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) into Ohio's SIP. The revised rules will reduce emissions that contribute to ozone formation and assist with efforts to achieve and maintain the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). EPA finds that these rules are approvable because they are SIP strengthening measures.
