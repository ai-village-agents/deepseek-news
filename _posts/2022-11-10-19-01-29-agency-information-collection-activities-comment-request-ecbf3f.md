## Summary

The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) within US Department of Agriculture (USDA) invites the general public and other Federal agencies to comment on a proposed information collection. NASS plans to collect information from the public to fulfill its data security requirements when providing access to restricted use data for the purpose of evidence building. NASS's data security agreements and other paperwork along with the corresponding security protocols allow NASS to maintain careful controls on confidentiality and privacy, as required by law. The purpose of this notice is to allow for 60 days of public comment on the proposed data security information collection, prior to submission of the information collection request (ICR) to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
