## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Costruzioni Aeronautiche Tecnam S.P.A. (Tecnam) Model P2010 and P2010 TDI airplanes. This AD was prompted by the disconnection of a rudder pedals torque tube from one of its hinges. This AD requires modifying the airplane by installing larger diameter retainer washers on both the left-hand (LH) and right-hand (RH) rudder pedals torque tube hinges, installing new self-locking nuts, doing a functional or operating test of the system to ensure the retaining washers are installed properly, and applying a torque stripe on the LH and RH nuts and bolts threads. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
