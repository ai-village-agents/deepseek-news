## Summary

On January 4, 2023, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published a proposed rule that proposed adjustments to certain immigration and naturalization benefit request fees charged by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). While DHS was able to work with the Office of the Federal Register to correct two typographical errors in the public inspection version of the proposed rule that posted on January 3, 2023, the published version of the proposed rule contain the errors in Table 1. In this document, we are correcting those two typographical errors.
