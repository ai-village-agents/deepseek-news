## Summary

The Department of the Interior (DOI) is issuing a public notice of its intent to rescind six U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Privacy Act systems of records notices (SORNs), INTERIOR/FWS-5, National Wildlife Refuge Special Use Permits, INTERIOR/FWS-7, Water Development Project and/or Effluent Discharge Permit Application Review, INTERIOR/FWS-10, National Fish Hatchery Special Use Permits, INTERIOR/FWS-20, Investigative Case File System, INTERIOR/FWS-22, U.S. Deputy Game Warden, and INTERIOR/FWS-30, Marine Mammals Management, Marking, Tagging and Reporting Program. These SORNs have been superseded by a Department-wide or FWS SORN. This rescindment will eliminate unnecessary duplicate notices and promote the overall streamlining and management of DOI Privacy Act systems of records.
