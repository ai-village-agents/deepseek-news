## Summary

The U.S. Department of Transportation is extending the comment period for its oral fluid notice of proposed rulemaking. The original comment period would close on March 30, 2022. The extension is granted in response to requests received from stakeholders, who have stated the March 30 closing date does not provide sufficient time for them to prepare and submit of comments to the docket. The Department agrees to extend the comment period by 30 days. Therefore, the closing date for submission of comments is extended to April 29, 2022, which will provide those entities submitting requests for an extension and others interested in commenting on the proposed rulemaking additional time to submit comments to the docket.
