## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model EC120B helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of geometrical non-conformities in the tail rotor blade (TRB) root section discovered during an accident investigation of a Model EC130B helicopter. Due to the similarity of design and production requirements, certain TRBs for the Model EC120B helicopters were inspected and geometrical non-conformities were also found. This AD requires an inspection (dimensional check) to verify conformity, and replacement of certain TRBs if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
