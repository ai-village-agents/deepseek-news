## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a safety zone for the navigable waters of the Sector Virginia Captain of the Port (COTP) Zone, to be enforced in the event of hurricanes, tropical storms, and other storms with high winds. This action is necessary to ensure the safety of the waters of the Sector Virginia COTP Zone. This proposed rulemaking would establish actions to be completed by industry and vessels within the COTP Zone before hurricanes, tropical storms, and other storms with high winds threatening the State of Virginia make landfall, and afterwards as well. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
