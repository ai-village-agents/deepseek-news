## Summary

On behalf of the United States Department of Agriculture, the United States Forest Service (USFS) filed an application with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) requesting the Secretary of the Interior extend Public Land Order (PLO) No. 6958 for an additional 30- year term. PLO No. 6958 withdrew 220 acres of National Forest System lands in Beaverhead County, Montana, from location and entry under the United States mining laws, subject to valid existing rights, to protect the USFS-managed recreation area. The lands remain open to leasing under the mineral leasing laws, and to such uses as may be made on National Forest System lands. The withdrawal created by PLO No. 6958 will expire on March 1, 2023, unless extended. This notice announces to the public an opportunity to comment on the proposal and announces the date, time, and how to access the virtual public meeting to be held in conjunction with this withdrawal extension application.
