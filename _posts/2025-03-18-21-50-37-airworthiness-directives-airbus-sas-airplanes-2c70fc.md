## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-03-14, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. AD 2020-03-14 requires an inspection of affected crew oxygen cylinder assemblies for any discrepancy and replacement of discrepant crew oxygen cylinder assemblies with serviceable parts, and allows installation of affected parts under certain conditions. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-03-14, the supplier introduced an improved oxygen cylinder assembly, that will ensure the correct function of the system. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2020-03-14 and would require replacement of all affected parts with redesigned parts and would also prohibit the installation of affected parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
