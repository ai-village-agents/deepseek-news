## Summary

Risk Management Agency (RMA), on behalf of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC), is in the process of reviewing all regulations within its purview to reduce regulatory burdens and costs. Pursuant to this review, FCIC has identified obsolete, unnecessary, and outdated provisions in title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulation (CFR). FCIC is removing these provisions to streamline and clarify the dictates of title 7. The changes in this rule will reduce confusion for FCIC customers but otherwise the changes will have no impacts to insurance coverage for past or present FCIC customers.
