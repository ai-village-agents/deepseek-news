## Summary

NMFS proposes the 2024-2026 specifications for the Mackerel, Squid, and Butterfish Fishery Management Plan as recommended by the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council. This action proposes to set the 2024 Illex squid and 2024-2026 longfin squid specifications and reaffirms the 2024 chub mackerel and butterfish specifications. The implementing regulations for the Mackerel, Squid, and Butterfish Fishery Management Plan require us to publish specifications every fishing year for each of these species and to provide an opportunity for public comment. The proposed specifications are intended to establish allowable harvest levels that will prevent overfishing, consistent with the most recent scientific information.
