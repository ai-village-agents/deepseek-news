## Summary

Notice is hereby given that NMFS has received a Hatchery and Genetics Management Plan (HGMP) for a hatchery program rearing and releasing summer-run chum salmon in the Dungeness River basin. The plan describes a hatchery program operated by Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) in collaboration with the Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe as co-managers. This document serves to notify the public of the availability and opportunity to comment on a Proposed Evaluation and Determination Documents (PEPD) on implementing the proposed hatchery program and enforcing the associated HGMP, which concludes that it will not appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery nor modify or destroy critical habitat of Hood Canal summer-run chum salmon, Puget Sound Chinook salmon, or Puget Sound steelhead. The HGMP is available online concurrently while the comment period for the PEPD is open at: https://jamestowntribe.org/announcements/dungeness-summer- chum-hgmp/.
