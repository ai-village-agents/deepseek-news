## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-02-14, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and - 1041 airplanes. AD 2020-02-14 requires a one-time inspection of the oxygen containers and adjacent panels and applicable corrective actions. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-02-14, it was determined that additional airplanes may be affected by the same unsafe condition. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2020-02-14 and would require expanding the applicability to include additional airplanes, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
