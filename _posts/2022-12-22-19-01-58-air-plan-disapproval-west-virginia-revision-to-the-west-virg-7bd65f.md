## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to disapprove a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of West Virginia on June 13, 2017. The revision pertains to a new rule setting forth the requirements to establish, at the discretion of the Secretary of the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (WVDEP), an alternative emission limitation (AEL) for a source that requests an AEL. This SIP revision was submitted in response to a finding of substantial inadequacy and SIP call published on June 12, 2015, for provisions in the West Virginia SIP related to excess emissions during startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) events. EPA is proposing to disapprove the SIP revision and proposing to determine that such SIP revision does not correct the deficiencies identified in the June 12, 2015, SIP Call.
