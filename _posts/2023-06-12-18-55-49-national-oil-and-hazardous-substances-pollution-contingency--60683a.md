## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) is amending the requirements in Subpart J of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) that govern the use of dispersants, other chemicals and other spill mitigating substances when responding to oil discharges into jurisdictional waters of the United States. This action addresses the efficacy and toxicity of dispersants and other chemical and biological agents, as well as public, state, local, and federal officials' concerns regarding their use. Specifically, the Agency is amending the Subpart J regulatory requirements for the NCP Product Schedule in two distinct ways. First, the Agency is adding new listing criteria, revising the efficacy and toxicity testing protocols, and clarifying the evaluation criteria for removing products from the NCP Product Schedule. Second, the Agency is amending requirements for the authorities, notifications, and data reporting when using chemical or biological agents in response to oil discharges to Clean Water Act (CWA) section 311 jurisdictional waters and adjoining shorelines. These requirements are anticipated to encourage the development of safer and more effective spill mitigating products and better target the use of these products to reduce the risks of oil discharges and response technologies to human health and the environment. Further, the amendments are intended to ensure that On-Scene Coordinators (OSCs), Regional Response Teams (RRTs), and Area Committees (ACs) have sufficient information to support agent authorization of use decisions.
