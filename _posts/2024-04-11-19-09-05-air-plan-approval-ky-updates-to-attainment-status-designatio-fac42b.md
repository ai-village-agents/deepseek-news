## Summary

The Commonwealth of Kentucky, through the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet (Cabinet), Kentucky Division for Air Quality (KDAQ), submitted a revision to the Kentucky State Implementation Plan (SIP) on November 29, 2022. The SIP revision updates the geographical boundary description and attainment status designation for the Henderson-Webster nonattainment area for the 2010 Sulfur Dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) primary National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The update is being made to conform Kentucky's attainment status tables with the federal attainment status designations made for this area. The SIP revision also includes minor language changes in the attainment status designations provisions. EPA is proposing to approve Kentucky's SIP revision pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act).
