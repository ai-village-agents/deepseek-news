## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing an environmental assessment (EA) prepared under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and NRC's regulations. This EA summarizes the results of the NRC staff's environmental review, which evaluates the potential environmental impacts of granting exemptions from NRC regulations and issuing an associated license amendment in response to a request from the Union Electric Company, doing business as (dba) Ameren Missouri (Ameren, the licensee) for Renewed Facility Operating License NPF-30, for the Callaway Plant, Unit No. 1 (Callaway). Specifically, the licensee is seeking a license amendment and regulatory exemptions that would, if granted, allow the licensee to use both a deterministic and risk-informed approach to address safety issues discussed in Generic Safety Issue (GSI)-191, "Assessment of Debris Accumulation in PWR [Pressurized Water Reactor] Sump Pump Performance" and to close Generic Letter (GL) 2004-02, "Potential Impact of Debris Blockage on Emergency Recirculation During Design Basis Accidents at Pressurized-Water Reactors." The NRC staff is issuing a final EA and finding of no significant impact (FONSI) associated with the proposed exemptions.
