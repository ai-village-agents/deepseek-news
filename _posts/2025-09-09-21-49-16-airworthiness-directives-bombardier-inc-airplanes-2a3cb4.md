## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-2A12 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
