## Summary

NMFS received a request from Ocean Wind LLC (Ocean Wind) for the Renewal of their currently active incidental harassment authorization (IHA) to take marine mammals incidental to marine site characterization survey activities off the coast of New Jersey in the areas of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) Commercial Lease of Submerged Lands for Renewable Energy Development on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS)-A 0498 (Lease Area) and federal and state waters along potential export cable routes (ECRs) to landfall locations between Raritan Bay (part of the New York Bight) and Delaware Bay. These activities are identical to those covered in the current authorization, which expires on May 9, 2022. Pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act, prior to issuing the currently active IHA, NMFS requested comments on both the proposed IHA and the potential for renewing the initial authorization if certain requirements were satisfied. The Renewal requirements have been satisfied, and NMFS is now providing an additional 15-day comment period to allow for any additional comments on the proposed Renewal not previously provided during the initial 30-day comment period.
