## Summary

NMFS adjusts the 2022 baseline quotas for U.S. North and South Atlantic swordfish based on available underharvest of the 2021 adjusted U.S. quotas. This action is necessary to implement binding recommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), as required by the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (ATCA), and to achieve domestic management objectives under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson- Stevens Act). This action to adjust the quotas is only temporary and will be effective through December 31, 2022. On January 1, 2023, the unadjusted annual baseline allocations of North and South Atlantic swordfish will renew and be available to harvest consistent with HMS regulations.
