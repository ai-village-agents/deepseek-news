## Summary

On March 6, 2020, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) solicited comments on a proposed interpretation of its low-level radioactive waste disposal regulations that would permit licensees to dispose of waste by transfer to persons who hold specific exemptions for the purpose of disposal. The public comment period was originally scheduled to close on April 20, 2020. In recognition of the impacts of the current COVID-19 pandemic across the nation, the NRC has decided to extend the public comment period to allow more time for members of the public to develop and submit their comments.
