## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily determines that no companies under review qualify for a separate rate and that these companies are, therefore, considered to be part of the People's Republic of China (China)-wide entity. Additionally, Commerce is partially rescinding this review with respect to: companies for which all review requests were timely withdrawn; and a company with no entries of subject merchandise during the period of review (POR), August 1, 2022, through July 31, 2023. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.
