## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Helicopters Model EC225LP helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of incorrect door opening instructions on the placards located on the right hand (RH) side of the VIP flap door. This AD requires installing a placard specifying jettisoning instructions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
