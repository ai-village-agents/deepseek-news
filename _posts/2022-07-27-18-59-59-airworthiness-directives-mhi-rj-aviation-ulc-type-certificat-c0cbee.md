## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain MHI RJ Aviation ULC Model CL-600-2C10 (Regional Jet Series 700, 701 & 702), CL-600-2C11 (Regional Jet Series 550), CL-600-2D15 (Regional Jet Series 705), CL-600-2D24 (Regional Jet Series 900), and CL-600-2E25 (Regional Jet Series 1000) airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of the failure of certain primary ejector fuel feed flexible hoses, which may have a thinner liner than specified by design requirements, and are therefore more susceptible to cracking. This AD requires replacing the hoses. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
