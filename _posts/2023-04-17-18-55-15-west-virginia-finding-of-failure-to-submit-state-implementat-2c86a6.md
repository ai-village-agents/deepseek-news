# West Virginia; Finding of Failure To Submit State Implementation Plan Revision in Response to the 2015 Findings of Substantial Inadequacy and SIP Calls To Amend Provisions Applying to Excess Emissions During Periods of Startup, Shutdown, and Malfunction

## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to find that the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (WVDEP) failed to timely submit a state implementation plan (SIP) revision required by the Clean Air Act (CAA) to address the deficiencies identified in EPA's 2015 findings of substantial inadequacy and "SIP calls" for provisions applying to excess emissions during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM). EPA is issuing this finding of failure to submit (FFS) without prior public notice and opportunity for comment. This action triggers certain CAA deadlines for EPA to impose sanctions if a state does not submit a complete SIP revision addressing the outstanding requirements and to promulgate a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) if EPA does not approve the state's submission as a SIP revision. In a separate but related action, published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, EPA is also issuing a final disapproval of a SIP revision submitted by West Virginia which allowed sources who could not meet emission limits during startup and shutdown events to apply for alternative emission limits (AELs) (see Docket ID No. EPA-R03-OAR-2022-0956).
