## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-20-07 for certain Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Trent 1000-AE3, Trent 1000-CE3, Trent 1000-D3, Trent 1000-G3, Trent 1000-H3, Trent 1000-J3, Trent 1000-K3, Trent 1000-L3, Trent 1000-M3, Trent 1000-N3, Trent 1000-P3, Trent 1000-Q3, Trent 1000-R3, Trent 7000-72, and Trent 7000-72C model turbofan engines. AD 2020-20-07 required initial and repetitive borescope inspections (BSIs) or visual inspections of the intermediate-pressure compressor (IPC) shaft assembly and, depending on the results of the inspection, replacement of the IPC shaft assembly. This AD was prompted by the manufacturer providing optional terminating actions for the required repetitive inspections and alternative inspection instructions. This AD continues to require initial and repetitive BSIs but allows modification of the engine in accordance with RRD service information as a terminating action to these inspections, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
