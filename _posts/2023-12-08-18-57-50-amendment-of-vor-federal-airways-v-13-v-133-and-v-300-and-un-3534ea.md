## Summary

This action proposes to amend Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-13, V-133, and V-300, and United States (U.S.) Area Navigation (RNAV) route T-331; establish Canadian RNAV routes Q-924, T-765, T-776, and T-810 in U.S. airspace; and revoke Jet Route J-533 and VOR Federal airway V-348. The FAA is proposing this action due to the planned decommissioning of the Thunder Bay, Ontario (ON), Canada, VOR navigational aid (NAVAID). This action is in support of NAV CANADA's NAVAID Modernization Program within Canada.
