Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on September 15, 2022, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of Pratum Farm, LLC of Salem, Oregon. Letters supplementing the complaint were filed on September 15, October 3, and October 4, 2022.
