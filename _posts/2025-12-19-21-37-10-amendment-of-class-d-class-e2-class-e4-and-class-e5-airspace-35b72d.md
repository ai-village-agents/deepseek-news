## Summary

This action proposes to amend Class D, Class E2, Class E4, and Class E5 airspace at Patuxent River Naval Air Station (NAS) (Trapnell Field), Patuxent River, MD. The currently designated Class D, Class E2, and Class E4 airspace do not properly contain instrument flight rule (IFR) operations, which require controlled airspace. The geographic coordinates for Patuxent River NAS (Trapnell Field) would be updated in the airspace legal descriptions. The reference to the decommissioned Patuxent VORTAC would also be updated in the Class E2, Class E4, and Class E5 airspace legal descriptions. Last, the geographic coordinates for the Patuxent River NDB would also be updated in the Class E2 and Class E4 airspace legal descriptions.
