# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus SAS Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A330-200 series airplanes, Model A330-200 Freighter series airplanes, and Model A330-300 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that certain inspection procedures specified an incorrect inspection area. This proposed AD would require repetitive detailed inspections of a certain stringer location, and applicable corrective actions if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which will be incorporated by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
