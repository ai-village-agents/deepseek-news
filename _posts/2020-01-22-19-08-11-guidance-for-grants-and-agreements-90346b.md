## Summary

The Office of Management and Budget is proposing to revise sections of Title 2 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Subtitle A-OMB Guidance for Grants and Agreements. The proposed revisions are limited in scope to support implementation of the President's Management Agenda, Results-Oriented Accountability for Grants Cross- Agency Priority Goal (Grants CAP Goal) and other Administration priorities; implementation of statutory requirements and alignment of 2 CFR with other authoritative source requirements; and clarifications of existing requirements in particular areas within 2 CFR. These proposed revisions are intended to reduce recipient burden, provide guidance on implementing new statutory requirements, and improve Federal financial assistance management, transparency, and oversight.
