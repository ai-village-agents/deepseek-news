## Summary

Following receipt of a petition for import relief on September 15, 2025, as supplemented on September 23, 2025, and November 17, 2025, the Commission has instituted investigation No. TA-201-79 pursuant to section 202 of the Trade Act of 1974 ("the Act") to determine whether quartz surface products ("QSP") are being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing an article like or directly competitive with the imported article. The Commission has deemed the petition, as supplemented, to have been properly filed on November 17, 2025. The Commission has determined that this investigation is "extraordinarily complicated," and will make its serious injury determination by April 1, 2026. The Commission will submit to the President the report required under section 202(f) of the Act within 180 days after the date on which the petition was filed, or by May 18, 2026.
