## Summary

NMFS is implementing harvest specifications and management measures for the 2023 non-tribal directed commercial Pacific halibut fishery that operates south of Point Chehalis, WA (46[deg]53.30' N lat.) in the International Pacific Halibut Commission's regulatory Area 2A off Washington, Oregon, and California. Specifically, this final rule establishes directed commercial fishing periods and fishing period catch limits by vessel size class for the 2023 fishing season. These actions are intended to conserve Pacific halibut and provide fishing opportunity where available.
