## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of New Hampshire. These revisions provide certifications that the State has adopted regulations meeting the requirements for reasonably available control technology (RACT) for the 2008 and 2015 ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). We are also proposing approval of amendments to a related regulation that New Hampshire revised as part of its RACT certifications for these two NAAQS, a revision to the State's definition of emergency generator, and removal from the SIP of two previously issued RACT orders. This action is being taken under the Clean Air Act.
