## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) modifies its rules to promote improvement in the efficacy and quality of video relay service (VRS) supported by the Interstate Telecommunications Relay Services (TRS) Fund. The modifications: increase the portion of monthly VRS minutes that may be handled by communications assistants (CAs) working at home; reduce the amount of prior interpreting experience required of VRS CAs who work at home; and allow VRS providers to use contract CAs, subject to conditions, for up to 30% of their monthly call minutes. These changes increase providers' flexibility to hire communications assistants from a wider pool of qualified sign-language interpreters. The Commission also modifies its rules to improve the process for registered VRS users to place calls to the United States while traveling abroad.
