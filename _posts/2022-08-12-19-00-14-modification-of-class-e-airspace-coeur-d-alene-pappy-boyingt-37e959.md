## Summary

The FAA is correcting a final rule that appeared in the Federal Register on June 10, 2022. The rule modified the Class E surface airspace, and the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Coeur D'Alene--Pappy Boyington Field, ID. The final rule's Class E5 airspace legal description was missing verbiage. This action adds that missing verbiage to correct the Class E5 airspace legal description.
