## Summary

The Department of the Air Force (DAF) is issuing this Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) assessing the potential social, economic, and environmental impacts associated with the Department of the Army (DoA) constructing and operating a new childcare center on Camp Bull Simons, Eglin Air Force Base (AFB), Florida; and the Department of the Air Force (DAF) constructing and operating one or more additional childcare centers in the area north of the Eglin Test and Training Complex (ETTC), Eglin AFB, Florida. DoA is a tenant of Eglin AFB on Camp Bull Simons. The purpose of the Proposed Action is to provide childcare capacity to support the needs of the DoA personnel assigned to Camp Bull Simons as well as DAF personnel living north of the ETTC. The Proposed Action is needed to address the current childcare deficiencies and hardships experienced by DoA and DAF military families residing north of the ETTC. The distance to the existing child development centers (CDCs) on Eglin Main and Hurlburt Field is too great to support these military families where they live and work. The DoA is proposing to provide childcare at a location to be determined on Camp Bull Simons. DAF is proposing to provide childcare at one or more of four alternative locations to include State Road (SR) 85 and Rattlesnake Bluff Road, Crestview West, Crestview Central, and Crestview East. None of the alternative locations are currently under the ownership or control of the federal government.
