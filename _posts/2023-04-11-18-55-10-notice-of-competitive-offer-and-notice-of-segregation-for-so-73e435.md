## Summary

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Pahrump Field Office will accept competitive bids on four parcels of public lands in Nye County, Nevada, for photovoltaic solar energy development: two parcels located within the Amargosa Valley Solar Energy Zone offered for lease, and two parcels to determine preferred right-of-way applicants. The BLM also announces the segregation of the two parcels of public lands outside the Amargosa Valley Solar Energy Zone from appropriation under the public land laws, including the Mining Law, but not the Mineral Leasing or Material Sales Acts, for a period of 2 years from the date of publication of this notice, subject to valid existing rights. This segregation will facilitate the orderly administration of the public lands while the BLM considers potential solar development on the two described parcels.
