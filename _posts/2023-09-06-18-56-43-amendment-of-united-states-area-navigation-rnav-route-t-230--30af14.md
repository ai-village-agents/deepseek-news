## Summary

This action corrects a final rule published by the FAA in the Federal Register on July 17, 2023, that amends United States Area Navigation (RNAV) route T-230 in the vicinity of St. Paul Island, AK, in support of a large and comprehensive T-route modernization project for the state of Alaska. The final rule identified the GARRS, AK, route point as a waypoint (WP), in error. This action makes an editorial correction to the reference of the GARRS, AK, WP to change it to be reflected as a Fix and match the FAA's National Airspace System Resource (NASR) database information.
