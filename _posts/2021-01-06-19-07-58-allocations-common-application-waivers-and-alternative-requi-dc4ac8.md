## Summary

This notice allocates a total of $85,291,000 in Community Development Block Grant disaster recovery (CDBG-DR) funds appropriated by the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Act, 2019 (the Act). The $85,291,000 in CDBG-DR funds allocated by this notice is for the purpose of assisting in long-term recovery from major disasters that occurred in 2018 and 2019. The allocations in this notice add to the funding previously allocated in the January 27, 2020 notice for these disasters. The Act requires HUD to allocate any funds not identified for long-term recovery from major disasters to be allocated for mitigation activities for 2018 disasters. Accordingly, under a separate notice, HUD will allocate the remaining $185,730,000 of funds available under the Act for mitigation activities in the most impacted and distressed areas resulting from a major disaster that occurred in 2018. This notice also contains a waiver and alternative requirement addressing the income limits applicable to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico for its CDBG-DR and CDBG-MIT grants. Additionally, this notice also provides additional flexibility to CDBG-DR grantees as they continue their disaster recovery efforts while also responding to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
