## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves a request that airplane operators subject to the applicability of Annex 16, Volume IV of the Convention on Civil Aviation (hereinafter the "Chicago Convention") submit electronically an Emissions Monitoring Plan (EMP), an annual Emissions Report (ER) to the FAA. Airplane operators may also submit an optional ER CORSIA Eligible Fuels Annex (CEFA) to the FAA if they want to receive credit for their use of CORSIA Eligible Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) or Lower Carbon Aviation Fuel (LCAF). The information to be collected is necessary because FAA will use the information to fulfill the United States' responsibilities under the Chicago Convention
