## Summary

This rule revises the general regulations for Federal marketing orders covering fruits, vegetables, and specialty crops by updating the section regarding information collections. Further, this rule updates nomenclature in the general regulations, numerous Federal marketing orders, the import regulations, the domestic hemp program regulations, and the peanut handling regulations administered by the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). Finally, this rule corrects typographical errors found in the AMS marketing order and import regulations and removes regulations no longer in effect. These changes are necessary to provide more accurate information in the regulations moving forward.
