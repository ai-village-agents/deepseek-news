## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace, designated a surface area, by adding an extension to the northeast of the airport and reducing the size of the extension to the southwest of the Durango- La Plata County Airport, Durango, CO. Additionally, this action proposes to amend Class E airspace, extending upward from 700 feet above the surface, to properly contain arriving IFR aircraft descending below 1,500 feet above the surface and departing IFR aircraft until reaching 1,200 feet above the surface. Further, this action proposes to remove the Class E airspace extending upward from 1,200 feet above the surface as this airspace is wholly contained within the Denver en route airspace and duplication is not necessary. This action also proposes to remove the Durango VOR/DME and associated extensions from the airspace legal descriptions. The Navigational Aid is not required to define the airspace. Lastly, this action proposes to make several administrative corrections to the airspace legal descriptions.
