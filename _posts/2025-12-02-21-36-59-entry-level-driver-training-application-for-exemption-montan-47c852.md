## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to grant an exemption from the qualification requirements pertaining to entry-level driver training (ELDT) theory instructors for Montana Trucking Association's Safety Coordinator, Mr. William Cole. The exemption will allow Mr. Cole to conduct classroom (theory) training for entry-level drivers who intend to operate commercial motor vehicles (CMV) used in the transportation of hazardous materials (HM). The exemption excuses Mr. Cole from the requirement to possess a commercial driver's license (CDL) or have previously held a CDL. FMCSA analyzed the application and public comments and determined that granting the exemption is likely to achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved in the absence of the exemption.
