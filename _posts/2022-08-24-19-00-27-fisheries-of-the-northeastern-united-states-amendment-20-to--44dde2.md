## Summary

NMFS proposes regulations to implement Amendment 20 to the Atlantic Surfclam and Ocean Quahog Fishery Management Plan. The Mid- Atlantic Fishery Management Council developed this action to limit the amount of surfclam or ocean quahog individual transferable quota share or annual allocation in the form of cage tags that an individual or their family members could hold. These changes are intended to ensure the management plan is consistent with requirements of the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, and to improve the management of these fisheries.
