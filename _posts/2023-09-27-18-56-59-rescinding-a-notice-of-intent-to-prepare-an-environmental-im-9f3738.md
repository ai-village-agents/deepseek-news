## Summary

The FHWA, in cooperation with the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), is issuing this notice to advise the public that we are rescinding the 2001 Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for a previous proposal to improve NYS Route 17 in Delaware County, New York (the Project, NYSDOT Project Identification Number [PIN] 9066.91). FHWA is rescinding the NOI because a substantial amount of time has passed since its original publication, and previously identified funding and design resources were reprioritized and reallocated to other needs, preventing the progression of the Project.
