## Summary

We are finalizing specifications for the 2023 Atlantic deep- sea red crab fishery, including an annual catch limit, and total allowable landings limit. This action is necessary to fully implement previously projected allowable red crab harvest levels that will prevent overfishing and allow harvesting of optimum yield. This action is intended to establish the allowable 2023 harvest levels, consistent with the Atlantic Deep-Sea Red Crab Fishery Management Plan.
