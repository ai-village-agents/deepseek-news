## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Dassault Aviation Model MYSTERE-FALCON 900, FALCON 900EX, FALCON 2000, and FALCON 2000EX airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of the wing anti-icing (WAI) system leaking in the wing leading edge. This AD requires a one-time inspection of the WAI system, and corrective actions if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
