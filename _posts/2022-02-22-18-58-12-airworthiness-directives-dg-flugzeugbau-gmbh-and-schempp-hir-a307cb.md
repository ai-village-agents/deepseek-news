## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for DG Flugzeugbau GmbH Model DG-1000T gliders and Schempp-Hirth Flugzeugbau GmbH Model Duo Discus T gliders with a Solo Kleinmotoren GmbH Solo Model 2350C or 2350D engine installed. This AD was prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) issued by the aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI describes the unsafe condition as failure of the bearing of the upper pulley of the belt driven reduction gear resulting in separation of the propeller from the engine. This AD requires replacing a certain hex-nut and establishing a life limit for the ball bearing assembly. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
