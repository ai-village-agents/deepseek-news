# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus SAS Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports that the latches for the forward and aft pressure relief doors could be opened during exposure to fire, leading to a breach in the engine core firewall. This proposed AD would require modification and re-identification of the affected thrust reversers (TRs) and latch access doors (LADs), as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which will be incorporated by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
