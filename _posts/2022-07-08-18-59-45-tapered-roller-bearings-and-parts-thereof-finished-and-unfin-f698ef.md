## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily determines that Shanghai Tainai Bearing Co., Ltd. (Tainai) has made sales of tapered roller bearings and parts thereof, finished and unfinished, (TRBs) from the People's Republic of China (China) at less than normal value (NV) during the period of review (POR), June 1, 2020, through May 31, 2021. The administrative review covers 11 companies; however, based on timely withdrawal of requests for review, we are now rescinding this administrative review with respect to two of these companies. Additionally, we find that Tainai and Zhejiang Jingli Bearing Technology Co., Ltd. (Jingli) have each demonstrated that they are eligible for a separate rate. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.
