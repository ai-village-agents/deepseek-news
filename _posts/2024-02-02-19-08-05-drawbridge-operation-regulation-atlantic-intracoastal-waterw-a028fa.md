## Summary

The Coast Guard is temporarily modifying the operating schedule that governs the Indiantown Road Bridge across the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway (AICW), mile 1006.2, at Jupiter, Florida. This action is necessary to alleviate vehicle traffic congestion on the Indiantown Road Bridge caused by the replacement of another nearby bridge. Once construction of the nearby bridge is complete, the Indiantown Road Drawbridge will return to normal scheduled operations.
