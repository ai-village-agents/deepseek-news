## Summary

The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) publishes notice of certain Federal agency requests for records disposition authority (records schedules). We publish notice in the Federal Register and on regulations.gov for records schedules in which agencies propose to dispose of records they no longer need to conduct agency business. We invite public comments on such records schedules. This records schedule notice was originally published on June 9, 2022. Due to multiple clerical errors, it was subsequently withdrawn on July 14, 2022. It is now reposted as a new notice allowing the full 45-day comment period for the public to submit comments.
