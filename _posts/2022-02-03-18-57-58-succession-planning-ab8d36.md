## Summary

Through this proposed rule, the NCUA Board (Board) would require that Federal Credit Union (FCU) boards of directors establish and adhere to processes for succession planning. The succession plans will help to ensure that the credit union has plans to fill key positions, such as officers of the board, management officials, executive committee members, supervisory committee members, and (where provided for in the bylaws) the members of the credit committee to provide continuity of operations. In addition, the proposed rule would require directors to be knowledgeable about the FCU's succession plan. Although the proposed rule would apply only to FCUs, the Board's purpose is to encourage and strengthen succession planning for all credit unions. The proposed rule would provide FCUs with broad discretion in implementing the proposed regulatory requirements to minimize any burden.
