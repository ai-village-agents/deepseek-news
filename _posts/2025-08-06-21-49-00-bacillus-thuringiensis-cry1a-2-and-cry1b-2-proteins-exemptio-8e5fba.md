## Summary

This regulation establishes exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of the Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1A.2 and Cry1B.2 proteins (hereafter Cry1A.2 and Cry1B.2 proteins) in or on the food and feed commodities of soybean when used as plant-incorporated protectants (PIP) in soybean. Bayer CropScience LP submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting these exemptions. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of these pesticides when used in accordance with the terms of the exemption.
