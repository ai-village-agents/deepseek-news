## Summary

The Commission has before it a petition for rulemaking (Petition) filed by KHGI Licensee, LLC, (Licensee), licensee of KHGI- TV, channel 13, Kearney, Nebraska (KHGI or Station), requesting the substitution of channel 18 for channel 13 at Kearney in the DTV Table of Allotments. Licensee states that the proposed channel substitution for KHGI from VHF channel 13 to UHF channel 18 would allow KHGI to significantly improve its over-the-air service to the Station's viewers in the Kearney, Nebraska, area. Licensee states that the proposed channel change from channel 13 to channel 18 would result a substantial increase in signal receivability for KHGI's core viewers and enable viewers to receive the Station's signal with a significantly smaller antenna. Licensee maintains that KHGI, as a VHF channel station, has had a long history of dealing with severe reception problems exacerbated by the analog to digital conversion. The proposed migration of KHGI from channel 13 to channel 18, Licensee contends, will be a favorable arrangement of allotments based on the enhanced signal levels that will be delivered to a large percentage of the Station's population without any predicted loss of coverage. Further, Licensee maintains that the change will result in an predicted increase of more than 37,000 persons in the Station's overall population and the staff has determined there is no loss of service. Licensee concludes by saying that the public interest would be best served by promptly granting its Petition with the specifications set forth therein so that Kearney-area viewers may benefit from substantially improved over-the- air broadcast television service as soon as possible.
