## Summary

As a result of these sunset reviews, the Department of Commerce (Commerce) finds that revocation of the antidumping duty orders on certain oil country tubular goods (OCTG) from India, the Republic of Korea (Korea), the Republic of Turkey (Turkey), and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (Vietnam) would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping. The magnitude of the dumping margins likely to prevail are indicated in the "Final Results of Sunset Review" section of this notice.
