## Summary

The Deepwater Horizon natural resource Trustees for the Florida Trustee Implementation Group have prepared the Draft Restoration Plan 3 and Environmental Assessment: Water Quality. The Draft RP3/EA proposes alternatives to help restore water quality impacted by the DWH oil spill. The Draft RP3/EA evaluates a reasonable range of thirteen project alternatives under the Oil Pollution Act, including criteria set forth in the OPA natural resource damage assessment regulations, and the National Environmental Policy Act and its implementing regulations. A no action alternative is also evaluated pursuant to the NEPA. The total estimated cost to implement the Florida TIG's eleven preferred alternatives is approximately $111.5 million. The Florida TIG invites the public to comment on the Draft RP3/EA.
