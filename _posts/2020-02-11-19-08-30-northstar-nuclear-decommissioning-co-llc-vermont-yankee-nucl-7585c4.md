## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing an exemption in response to an August 28, 2019, request from NorthStar Nuclear Decommissioning Company (NorthStar NDC), for the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station, from the requirement to investigate and report to the NRC when NorthStar NDC does not receive notification of receipt of a shipment, or part of a shipment, of low-level radioactive waste within 20 days after transfer from the Vermont Yankee facility. NorthStar NDC requested that the time period for it to receive acknowledgement that the shipment has been received by the intended recipient be extended from 20 to 45 days to avoid an excessive administrative burden as operational experience indicates that rail or mixed mode shipments may take more than 20 days to reach their destination.
