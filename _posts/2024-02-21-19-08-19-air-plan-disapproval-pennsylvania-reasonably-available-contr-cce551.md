# Air Plan Disapproval; Pennsylvania; Reasonably Available Control Technology Case-by-Case Permits for Keystone, Conemaugh and Homer City Generating Facilities for the 1997 and 2008 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards

## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to disapprove state implementation plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) on behalf of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania). PADEP submitted SIP revisions for the Keystone, Conemaugh and Homer City electric generating facilities on May 26, 2022 to address certain reasonably available control technique (RACT) requirements for the 1997 and 2008 ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). EPA is proposing to disapprove the May 26, 2022 SIP revisions for these facilities as the SIPs contain problematic provisions and fail to justify the selection of permit limits as RACT consistent with applicable requirements and case law. This action is being taken under the Clean Air Act (CAA).
