## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Embraer S.A. (Type Certificate previously held by Yabor[atilde] Ind[uacute]stria Aeron[aacute]utica S.A.; Embraer S.A.) Model ERJ 170- 200 STD, ERJ 170-200 LR, ERJ 170-200 SU, and ERJ 170-200 LL airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of an in-flight detachment of a right- hand wing tip and the subsequent determination that cracks could develop on the wing tip connection area that can affect its structural integrity to the point of an in-flight detachment. This AD requires a detailed inspection for cracks of the affected wing tip connections, corrective action if necessary, and revision of the existing maintenance or inspection program, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA previously sent an emergency AD to all known U.S. owners and operators of these airplanes. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
