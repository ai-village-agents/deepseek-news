## Summary

The Department is interested in design concepts and construction and financing proposals for the development of completely new terminals and concourses to replace or build upon the existing main terminal and satellite concourses at Washington Dulles International Airport. This RFI is being conducted to inform and develop potential approaches for entirely new terminal(s) and concourses to replace the existing terminal and concourses. The Department will also accept submissions that propose to retain portions of the existing airport facilities, including, for example, by incorporating all or part of the historic Eero Saarinen-designed main terminal into a new terminal building.
