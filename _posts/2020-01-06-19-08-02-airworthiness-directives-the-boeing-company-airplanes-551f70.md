## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 777-300ER and 777F series airplanes. This AD was prompted by an evaluation by the design approval holder (DAH) indicating that the fuselage stringers, stringer splices, and skin splice straps are subject to widespread fatigue damage (WFD). This AD requires repetitive detailed inspections of certain stringer splices and skin splice straps for any cracks, repetitive high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections of certain stringers and stringer splices for any cracks, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
