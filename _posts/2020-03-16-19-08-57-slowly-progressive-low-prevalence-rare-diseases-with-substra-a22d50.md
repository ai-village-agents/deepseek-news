## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled "Slowly Progressive, Low-Prevalence Rare Diseases With Substrate Deposition That Results From Single Enzyme Defects: Providing Evidence of Effectiveness for Replacement or Corrective Therapies." This document provides guidance to sponsors on the evidence necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of investigational new drugs or new drug uses intended for slowly progressive, low-prevalence rare diseases that are associated with substrate deposition and are caused by single enzyme defects. This guidance applies only to those low-prevalence rare diseases with a well-characterized pathophysiology and in which changes in substrate deposition can be readily measured in relevant tissue or tissues. This guidance incorporates the comments received for and finalizes the draft guidance of the same name issued on July 27, 2018.
