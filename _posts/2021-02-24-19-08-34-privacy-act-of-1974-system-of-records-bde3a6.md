## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of the Treasury ("Treasury" or the "Department") (including Treasury bureaus, offices, and other subcomponents), proposes to establish a new Treasury system of records titled, "Department of the Treasury .020-- Health Screening and Contact Tracing Records." Treasury collects these records when it knows or suspects that a person who was infected with a communicable disease came in close physical proximity to or had physical contact with other persons while working in or visiting a Treasury facility (including Treasury sponsored events in non-Treasury facilities), and Treasury determines that the collection of such records is necessary to protect the health of Treasury personnel (meaning employees, grantees, contractors, and interns), and Treasury visitors (which includes non-Treasury federal employees and contractors, detailees from other federal agencies working at a Treasury facility, and members of the public who visit a Treasury facility). Treasury may collect these records in response to a health- related declaration of a national emergency by the President, a public health emergency declared by the Health and Human Service (HHS) Secretary or a designated federal official or a designated state official. Even in the absence of a health-related declaration of national emergency or declaration of public health emergency (HHS or state level), Treasury may collect these records if it determines that a significant risk of substantial harm exists to the health of Treasury personnel or visitors.
