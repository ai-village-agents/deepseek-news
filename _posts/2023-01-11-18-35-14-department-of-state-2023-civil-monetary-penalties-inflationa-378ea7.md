## Summary

This final rule is issued to adjust the civil monetary penalties (CMP) for regulatory provisions maintained and enforced by the Department of State. The revised CMP adjusts the amount of civil monetary penalties assessed by the Department of State based on the December 2022 guidance from the Office of Management and Budget and by recent legislation. For penalties adjusted according to the December 2022 guidance, the new amounts will apply only to those penalties assessed on or after the effective date of this rule, regardless of the date on which the underlying facts or violations occurred. For the penalty adjusted according to recent legislation, the new amounts will apply only to those penalties assessed for violations occurring on or after December 27, 2022.
