## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the establishment of a docket to obtain information and comments that will assist the Agency in assessing whether in-home disposal products can be expected to meet the public health goal of mitigating the risk of nonmedical use or overdose if the Agency were to require drug manufacturers to make in-home disposal products available to patients under a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS). The Agency would like information and comments on the issues to be discussed at the public workshop convened by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine's (NASEM's) Forum on Drug Discovery, Development, and Translation entitled "Defining and Evaluating In-Home Disposal Systems for Opioid Analgesics" on June 26 and 27, 2023.
