## Summary

GSA proposes to modify a system of records subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. The system of records was established to collect and maintain records needed by the Office of Inspections to carry out its responsibilities pursuant to the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) is statutorily directed to provide leadership and coordination and recommend policies for activities relating to programs and operations of the General Services Administration, to promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the administration of such programs and operations, and to prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse in such programs and operations. Accordingly, the records in this system are used in the course of inspections and evaluations, and other special projects as determined by the Inspector General. The previously published notice is being revised to add four new routine uses and make changes to update the System Of Records Notice (SORN).
