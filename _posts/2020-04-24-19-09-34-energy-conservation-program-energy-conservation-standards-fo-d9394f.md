## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is initiating an effort to determine whether to amend the current energy conservation standards for single package vertical air conditioners (SPVACs) and single package vertical heat pumps (SPVHPs), collectively referred to as single package vertical units (SPVUs). This request for information (RFI) solicits information from the public to help DOE determine whether amended standards for SPVUs, a category of covered commercial equipment, would result in significant additional energy savings and whether such standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified. DOE welcomes written comments from the public on any subject within the scope of this document (including those topics not specifically raised in this RFI), as well as the submission of data and other relevant information.
