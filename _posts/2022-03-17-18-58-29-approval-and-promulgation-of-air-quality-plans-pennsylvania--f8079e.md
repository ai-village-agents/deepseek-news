## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve multiple state implementation plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. These revisions were submitted by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) to establish and require reasonably available control technology (RACT) for eight major sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and/or nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) pursuant to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's conditionally approved RACT regulations. In this rulemaking action, EPA is proposing to approve source-specific RACT determinations (case-by-case or alternative NO<INF>X</INF> emission limits) for sources at eight major NO<INF>X</INF> and VOC emitting facilities submitted by PADEP. These RACT evaluations were submitted to meet RACT requirements for the 1997 and/or 2008 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). This action is being taken under the Clean Air Act (CAA).
