## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the Missouri State Implementation Plan (SIP) received on March 19, 2025, that contain updates to the construction permit requirement regulations for stationary and portable air sources in Missouri that help ensure ambient air quality standards are met. The revisions to this rule include updating the fees for facilities applying for and receiving construction permits for air pollution sources; removing a subsection from the state rule that was never approved in the SIP; and making administrative wording changes. These revisions do not impact the stringency of the SIP or have an adverse effect on air quality. The EPA's proposed approval of this rule revision is being done in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
