## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH Model MBB-BK 117 D-2 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of chafing marks on the wiring harness behind the middle side panels in the area of the front passenger (PAX) panels. This proposed AD would require inspecting, modifying, and rerouting the wiring harness, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
