## Summary

This Notice advises the public that the Indian Health Service (IHS) proposes to expand the geographic boundaries of the Purchased/ Referred Care Delivery Area (PRCDA) for the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation to include the counties of Fairfield, Hartford, Litchfield, Middlesex, New Haven, Tolland, and Windham in the State of Connecticut. The current PRCDA for the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation includes the Connecticut county of New London. Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation members residing outside of the PRCDA are eligible for direct care services, however, they are not eligible for Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) services. The sole purpose of this expansion would be to authorize additional Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation members and IHS beneficiaries to receive PRC services.
