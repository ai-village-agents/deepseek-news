## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Vulcanair S.p.A. Model V1.0 airplanes. This proposed AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as corrosion on the lower fuselage truss. This proposed AD would require a detailed visual inspection of the right- hand (RH) and left-hand (LH) lower rear attachments of the fuselage truss for corrosion, a tactile inspection of the lower rear attachments for missing sealant, and a general visual inspection of the lower fuselage truss welded pipes for corrosion and the related rivets for missing stems and, depending on findings, additional inspections and actions (including a tap test) and applicable corrective actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
