## Summary

Oklo Power LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Oklo Inc., submitted a custom combined license application for one Aurora reactor to be located at the Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho on March 11, 2020. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has denied the Oklo Aurora custom combined license application for failure to provide information in response to NRC staff requests for additional information (RAIs). The agency is denying the application without prejudice, and Oklo is free to resubmit its application supplemented by additional information that was previously requested.
