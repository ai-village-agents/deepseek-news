## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to find that California has failed to submit state implementation plan (SIP) elements required under the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act") to implement the 2012 national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) ("2012 PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS") in the Los Angeles-South Coast Air Basin ("South Coast"). California was required to submit a SIP that meets the Serious area plan requirements for a reasonable further progress demonstration, quantitative milestones, an attainment demonstration, and contingency measures for the 2012 PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS by December 31, 2023. The State submitted the required SIP elements, but subsequently withdrew its submission. If the EPA has not affirmatively found that the State has submitted a complete SIP to correct these deficiencies within 18 months of this finding, the offset sanctions will apply in the area. If within six additional months the EPA has still not affirmatively determined that the State has submitted a complete SIP to correct the deficiencies, the highway funding sanction will apply in the area. No later than two years after the EPA makes this finding, if the State has not submitted and the EPA has not approved each of the required SIP elements, the EPA must promulgate a Federal implementation plan (FIP) to address the remaining requirements.
