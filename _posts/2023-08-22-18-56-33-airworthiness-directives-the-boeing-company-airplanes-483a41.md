# Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a reported quality escapement where the seat track fitting nuts were under-torqued on some flight attendant seats in production. This proposed AD requires re- torqueing each free standing attendant seat track fitting nut. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
