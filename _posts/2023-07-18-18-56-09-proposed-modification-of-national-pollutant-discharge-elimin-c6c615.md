## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 10 proposes to modify the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) general permit for concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) in Idaho excluding Tribal lands (Permit). EPA proposes to modify the Permit to establish monitoring conditions for the subsurface discharges of pollutants from production areas and dry weather surface and subsurface discharges from land application areas at these CAFOs to waters of the United States. A Petition for Review was filed on September 22, 2020, in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals challenging the Permit; the Court granted the petition. The modified permit includes new and revised conditions to address the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal's Order and Opinion filed on December 16, 2021 (Food & Water Watch et al. v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (No. 20-71554)).
