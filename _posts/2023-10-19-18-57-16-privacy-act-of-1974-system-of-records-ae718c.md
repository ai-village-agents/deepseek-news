## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC, Commission, or Agency) proposes to modify an existing system of records, FCC/WTB-6, Archival Radio Operator Records, subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. This action is necessary to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act to publish in the Federal Register notice of the existence and character of records maintained by the agency. The Commission uses this system to administer the Commission's radio operator program including applications and determinations of license applicant qualifications, and to refer possible violations of law to the appropriate office within the Commission and to the appropriate agency outside the Commission. This modification makes various necessary changes and updates, including formatting changes required by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-108 since its previous publication, the addition of new routine uses, as well as the revision and deletion of existing routine uses.
