## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) issues a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to prioritize processing review of certain applications filed by commercial and noncommercial radio and television broadcast stations that provide locally originated programming. The Commission's goal is to provide additional incentive to stations to provide programming that responds to the needs and interests of the communities they are licensed to serve. In 2017, the Commission eliminated the rule that required broadcast stations to maintain a main studio located in or near their community of license, as well as the associated requirement that the main studio have program origination capability. We propose this processing priority in order to further encourage radio and TV stations to serve their community of license with local journalism or other locally originated programming. Such prioritization would be granted to renewal applicants, as well as applicants for assignment or transfer of license, that certify they provide locally originated programming, thereby advancing our efforts to promote localism and serve local communities across the nation.
