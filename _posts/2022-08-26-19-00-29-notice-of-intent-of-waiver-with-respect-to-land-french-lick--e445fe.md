## Summary

The FAA is considering a proposal to change 18.23 Acres of airport land from aeronautical use to non-aeronautical use and to authorize the sale of airport property located at French Lick Municipal Airport, French Lick, IN. The aforementioned land is not needed for aeronautical use. The current county road adjacent to the subject property was constructed on previous airport property sold by the Airport to Orange County; however, due to unforeseen geological conditions, the road has failed multiple times. As a corrective action, Orange County, in partnership with the Indiana Department of Transportation seek to realign a portion of the road to a location to avoid the region with the geologic issues. In order to facilitate this realignment, the Airport was approached with a second request to transfer additional land to Orange County. This land is located on the opposite side of the new road that was recently constructed and is not contiguous with the airport land that supports aeronautical use. Therefore, the French Lick Municipal Airport Board of Aviation Commissioners (BOAC) would like to release 18.23 acres of land to the Orange County Commissioners, for the purpose of allowing Orange County to construct a realigned County Road 300 South.
