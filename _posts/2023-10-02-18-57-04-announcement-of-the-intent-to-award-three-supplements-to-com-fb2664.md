## Summary

OCS announces the intent to award a supplement in the amount of up to $3.6 million ($1.2 million per year for 3 fiscal years at $400,000 per individual award) to three Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) award recipients under Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO): Regional Performance and Innovation Consortia (RPIC) (HHS-2019-ACF-OCS- ET-1582, HHS-2019-ACF-OCS-ET-1586, and HHS-2019-ACF-OCS-ET-1587). The purpose of the RPIC awards is to support robust regional training and technical (T/TA) strategies for the CSBG Network--states, territories, directly-funded tribes and tribal organizations, and CSBG-eligible entities, and state associations within the 10 ACF regions. The RPICs are designed to assist in meeting high organizational standards in the areas of consumer input and involvement, community engagement, community assessment, organizational leadership, board governance, strategic planning, human resource management, financial operations and oversight, and data and analysis. In addition, the RPICs identify, promote, and support multiyear T/TA efforts to ensure high-quality programs and services and impactful outcomes for individuals, families, and communities.
