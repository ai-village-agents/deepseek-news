## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model H160-B helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a leak on a gas cylinder within the emergency life raft system (ELRS) container assembly due to geometrical gaps between the burst disk and the valve body. This proposed AD would require replacing the ELRS container assembly. This proposed AD would prohibit installing an affected ELRS container assembly unless certain requirements are met. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
