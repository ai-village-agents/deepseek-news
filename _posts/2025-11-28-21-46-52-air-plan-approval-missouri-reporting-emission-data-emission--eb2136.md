## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing approval of revisions to the Missouri State Implementation Plan (SIP), and Operating Permits Program related to Reporting Emission Data, Emission Fees, and Process Information. The revisions set emission fees and a base fee for calendar years 2025-2028 and beyond, add 1- Bromopropane to the category 1 Hazardous Air Pollutant list in table 1, update two publication dates for material that is incorporated by reference and make minor administrative changes to the rule. These revisions do not impact the stringency of the SIP or have an adverse effect on air quality. The EPA's proposed approval of this rule revision is being done in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
