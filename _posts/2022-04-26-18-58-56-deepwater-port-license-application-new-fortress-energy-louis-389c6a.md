## Summary

The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), in coordination with the Maritime Administration (MARAD), will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) as part of the environmental review of the New Fortress Energy Louisiana FLNG LLC (Applicant) deepwater port license application. The application proposes the ownership, construction, operation and eventual decommissioning of an offshore natural gas export deepwater port, known as New Fortress Energy Louisiana FLNG, that would be located in Federal waters approximately 16 nautical miles off the southeast coast of Grand Isle, Louisiana in a water depth of approximately 30 meters. The deepwater port would allow for the loading of liquefied natural gas (LNG) trading carriers. This Notice of Intent (NOI) requests public participation in the scoping process, provides information on how to participate and announces an informational virtual open house and virtual public meeting. Pursuant to the criteria provided in the Deepwater Port Act of 1974, as amended, Louisiana is the designated Adjacent Coastal State (ACS) for this application.
