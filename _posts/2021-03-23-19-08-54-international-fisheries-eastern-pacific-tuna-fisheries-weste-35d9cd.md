## Summary

NMFS announces approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) of revisions to collection-of-information requirements published in a final rule on June 22, 2020 (June 2020 Final Rule). The June 2020 Final Rule revised the management regime for U.S. fishing vessels that target tunas and other highly migratory species (HMS) in the area of overlapping jurisdiction in the Pacific Ocean between the Inter- American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) and the Commission for the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPFC) and revised the reporting and recordkeeping requirements applicable in that area. The June 2020 Final Rule did not include an effective date for those changes because OMB had not yet approved the collection-of-information revisions. This final rule announces OMB approval of the revisions to the collection- of-information requirements under OMB Control Numbers 0648-0649 and 0648-0218 and an effective date for the revisions to reporting requirements included in the June 2020 Final Rule.
