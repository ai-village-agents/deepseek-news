## Summary

On December 21, 2020, the FCC released a Public Notice (PN), Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau Seeks Comment on a National 911 Call Center Contact Information Database, PS Dockets Nos. 13-75, 11-60. The PN announced that the Bureau will seek comments on a letter, filed on December 7, 2020 by the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions' (ATIS) Network Reliability Steering Committee. This letter addresses third-party efforts to develop a national Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) contact information database. ATIS supports the development of this database, but believes that providers need a liability safe harbor for potentially inaccurate database information. ATIS further believes participation in this database should be voluntary.
