## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain ATR--GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42- 500 and ATR72-212A airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of potential use of improper material during the production of vertical tail plane (VTP) fittings. This proposed AD would require, for certain airplanes, an inspection for the material of affected fuselage-to-VTP fittings, an inspection report, and corrective actions, and, for certain other airplanes, part replacement, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
