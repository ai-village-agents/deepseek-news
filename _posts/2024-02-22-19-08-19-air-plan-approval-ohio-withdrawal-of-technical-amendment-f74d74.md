## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to correct the November 19, 2020, removal of the Air Nuisance Rule (ANR) from the Ohio State Implementation Plan (SIP). This action is in response to a February 10, 2023, decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit to remand without vacatur EPA's removal of the ANR from the Ohio SIP. Because the Court did not vacate EPA's removal of the ANR, the ANR is currently not in Ohio's SIP. After reevaluating EPA's November 19, 2020, rulemaking, as directed by the Court, EPA is proposing to determine that its November 2020 final action was in error, and to correct that action by reinstating the ANR as part of the Ohio SIP.
