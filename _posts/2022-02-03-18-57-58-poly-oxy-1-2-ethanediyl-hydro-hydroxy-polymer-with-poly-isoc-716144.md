## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of Poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl)-[alpha]-hydro- [omega]-hydroxy-, polymer with poly(isocyanatoalkyl) benzene, alkylol- blocked when used as an inert ingredient in a pesticide chemical formulation. BYK USA Inc. submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of Poly(oxy-1,2- ethanediyl)-[alpha]-hydro-[omega]-hydroxy-, polymer with poly(isocyanatoalkyl) benzene, alkylol-blocked on food or feed commodities.
