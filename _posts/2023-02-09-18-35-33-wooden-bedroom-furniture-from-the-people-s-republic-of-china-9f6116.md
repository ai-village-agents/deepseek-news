## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) continues to determine that nine companies/company groupings subject to this administrative review of the antidumping duty (AD) order on wooden bedroom furniture (WBF) from the People's Republic of China (China) are part of the China-wide entity because they did not demonstrate eligibility for separate rates, and that seven companies/company groupings had no shipments of WBF during the period of review (POR), January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2021. Although invited to do so, interested parties did not comment on the preliminary results of this review. We have adopted the preliminary results of this review as the final results of the review.
