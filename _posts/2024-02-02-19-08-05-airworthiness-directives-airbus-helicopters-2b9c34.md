## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model AS332C, AS332C1, AS3322L, AS332L1, AS332L2, and EC225LP helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of cracks on the fuel filter bowl (bowl) due to over-torquing. This proposed AD would require visually inspecting the bowls of the right hand (RH) and left hand (LH) fuel filters for any cracks and seepage. Depending on the inspection results, this proposed AD would require removing an affected fuel filter from service and replacing that part. This proposed AD would also allow a certain fuel filter to be installed on a helicopter if certain actions are accomplished, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
