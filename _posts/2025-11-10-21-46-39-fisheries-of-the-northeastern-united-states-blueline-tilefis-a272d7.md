## Summary

Effective at 0001 hours on November 10, 2025, Federal commercial tilefish permit holders are prohibited from fishing for, catching, possessing, transferring or landing blueline tilefish in the Tilefish Management Unit for the remainder of the 2025 fishing year. This action is required because NMFS has projected that 100 percent of the 2025 total allowable landings will have been caught. This action is intended to prevent over-harvest of blueline tilefish for the fishing year.
