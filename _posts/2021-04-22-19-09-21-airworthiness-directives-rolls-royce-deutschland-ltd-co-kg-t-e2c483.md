## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-15-12, which applies to certain Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Trent 1000 model turbofan engines. AD 2020-15-12 requires initial and repetitive ultrasonic or visual inspections of the intermediate-pressure compressor (IPC) stage 1 rotor blade root (front face), IPC stage 2 rotor blade root (front and rear face), and IPC shaft stage 2 dovetail post (front face), and removal of any cracked parts from service. AD 2020-15-12 also requires an inspection after asymmetric power and cabin depressurization events. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-15-12, the manufacturer introduced IPC stage 1 and stage 2 rotor blades in kitted sets, which terminate the need for initial and repetitive ultrasonic or visual inspections for certain IPC parts. This proposed AD would continue to require initial and repetitive ultrasonic or visual inspections of certain IPC parts until replacement of the IPC stage 1 and stage 2 rotor blades with redesigned IPC stage 1 and stage 2 rotor blades in kitted sets. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
