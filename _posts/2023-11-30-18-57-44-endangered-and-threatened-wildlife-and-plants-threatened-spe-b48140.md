## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), determine threatened species status under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended, for the distinct population segment (DPS) of the North American wolverine (Gulo gulo luscus) occurring in the contiguous United States. This rule adds the contiguous U.S. DPS of the North American wolverine to the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. We are also issuing an interim rule under the authority of section 4(d) of the Act (an "interim 4(d) rule") that provides the prohibitions, and exceptions to those prohibitions, necessary and advisable for the conservation of the contiguous U.S. DPS of the North American wolverine.
