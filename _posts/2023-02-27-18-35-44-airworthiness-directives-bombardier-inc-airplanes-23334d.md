## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-2A12 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that certain fasteners attaching the fuselage skin to a certain stringer may be missing. This AD requires inspecting for missing fasteners and damage, including cracking, of the affected area, and repair or installation of fasteners if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
