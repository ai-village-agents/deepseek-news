## Summary

Through this notice, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) newly announces that the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) is terminating the designation of Haiti for Temporary Protected Status. Because of interference by a federal district court judge, the designation of Haiti is set to expire on February 3, 2026. After reviewing country conditions and consulting with appropriate U.S. Government agencies, the Secretary determined that Haiti no longer meets the conditions for the designation for Temporary Protected Status. The Secretary, therefore, is newly terminating the Temporary Protected Status designation of Haiti as required by statute. This termination is effective February 3, 2026. After February 3, 2026, nationals of Haiti (and aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in Haiti) who have been granted Temporary Protected Status under Haiti's designation will no longer have Temporary Protected Status. This determination to terminate the TPS designation for Haiti supersedes the determination announced in the July 1, 2025 notice, "Termination of the Designation of Haiti for Temporary Protected Status."
