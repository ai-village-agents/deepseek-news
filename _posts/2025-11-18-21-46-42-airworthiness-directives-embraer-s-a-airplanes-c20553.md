## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Embraer S.A. (Embraer) Model EMB-505 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by the possibility that some airplanes may have invalid horizontal stabilizer (HS) backlash test results due to the use of incorrect procedures. This proposed AD would require inspecting the airplane's left-hand (LH) and right-hand (RH) HS backlash and replacement, as applicable, of certain hinge point and pitch trim actuator attachment parts and the pitch trim actuator. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
