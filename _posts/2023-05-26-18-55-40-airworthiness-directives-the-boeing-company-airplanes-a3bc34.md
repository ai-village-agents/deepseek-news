## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 777 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of cracks found in the pivot bulkhead forward outer chord of a certain station. Analysis revealed higher bending stresses across the chord than originally assessed. This AD requires repetitive detailed and high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections of the pivot bulkhead forward outer chord of a certain station and longeron fitting for cracking and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
