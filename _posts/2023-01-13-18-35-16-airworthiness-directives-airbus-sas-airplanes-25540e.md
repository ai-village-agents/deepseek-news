## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2013-07-03, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A330-200, A330-200 Freighter, A330-300, A340-200, and A340-300 series airplanes; and Model A340-541 and A340-642 airplanes. AD 2013-07-03 requires repetitive inspections for degradation of the bogie pivot pins and for any cracks and damage of the pivot pin bushes of the main and central landing gear; an inspection of the affected bogie pivot pins for corrosion and base metal cracks; and repairing or replacing bogie pivot pins and pivot pin bushes, if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2013-07-03, a modification was developed that addresses the unsafe condition and it was determined that a parts installation prohibition is necessary. This proposed AD would continue to require certain actions in AD 2013-07-03, add an optional modification that would terminate the repetitive inspections, and add a parts installation prohibition, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
