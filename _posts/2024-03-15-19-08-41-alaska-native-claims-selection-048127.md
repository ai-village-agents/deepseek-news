## Summary

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) hereby provides constructive notice that it will issue an appealable decision replacing its August 3, 2023, decision ("original decision") which approved lands for conveyance to The Aleut Corporation, pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 (ANCSA). The original decision is vacated in its entirety due to an error in land status and is replaced by the new decision. The lands approved for conveyance lie entirely within the Aleutian Islands Unit of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge.
