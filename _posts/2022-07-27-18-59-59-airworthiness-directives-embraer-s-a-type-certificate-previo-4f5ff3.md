## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Embraer S.A. Model ERJ 190-100 ECJ airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary and that some life limits on some components used on the main landing gear (MLG) may not be properly controlled, due to interchanging those parts between airplane models with different operational loads during repair or overhaul. This AD requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations; reviewing maintenance records of the MLG assemblies to determine if any life-limited item has been replaced and reporting those findings; and re-identifying the MLG assemblies and certain components; as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also prohibits installing certain part numbers. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
