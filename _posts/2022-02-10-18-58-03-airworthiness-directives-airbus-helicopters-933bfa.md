# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-22-01 which applies to all Airbus Helicopters Model AS332C, AS332C1, AS332L, and AS332L1 helicopters. AD 2020-22-01 requires inspecting the affected parts and associated frame bores for discrepancies, applicable corrective actions, and reporting certain information if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-22-01, a significant number of reports were received of finding corrosion on the affected parts. This proposed AD would retain the requirements of AD 2020-22-01, add recurring inspections, and update the applicable service information. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
