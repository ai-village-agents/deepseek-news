## Summary

The Department of State (the Department) is adjusting the Schedule of Fees for Consular Services (Schedule) by removing Item Number 74, a $25 return check processing fee. Domestically, the Bureau of Consular Affairs, Office of Passport Services (CA/PPT), has charged customers this fee when the instruments they have used to submit payment for a passport application could not be processed due to insufficient funds, closed accounts, stop payments, and altered/ fictious checks or money orders. A recent review of the Department's Cost of Service Model (CoSM) established that the costs associated with attempts to recover on non-viable instruments are now captured within the passport application fee. The Department therefore stopped charging this fee on December 13, 2021, and will remove this fee from the Schedule.
