## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to amend the anchorage regulations for the Delaware Bay and River, and adjacent waters, by establishing two new, offshore deep-water anchorages. The purpose of this proposed rule is to improve navigation safety by accommodating recent and anticipated future growth in vessel size and volume of vessel traffic entering the Delaware Bay and River, and to preserve areas traditionally used or needed for anchoring. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
