## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 767-300F airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report indicating that the installation requirements were not followed for the first observer seat in the flight deck. This proposed AD would require installing placards in various locations of the flight deck to indicate the proper position for the first observer seat during taxi, takeoff, and landing, and revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
