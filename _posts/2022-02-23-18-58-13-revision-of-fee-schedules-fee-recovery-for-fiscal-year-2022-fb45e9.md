## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend the licensing, inspection, special project, and annual fees charged to its applicants and licensees. These proposed amendments are necessary to implement the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act, which requires the NRC to recover, to the maximum extent practicable, approximately 100 percent of its annual budget less certain amounts excluded from this fee-recovery requirement. In addition, on August 20, 2021, the Chief Financial Officer granted a public interest exemption from the provisions in the fiscal year 2021 final fee rule that required fees for import and export licensing actions. Therefore, this proposed rule would not assess fees for import and export licensing activities in fiscal year 2022.
