## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-2B16 (601-3A, 601-3R, and 604 Variants) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by sleeve loops on some passenger oxygen mask lanyards that had improper crimping and unsealed ends. This proposed AD would require an inspection of the passenger oxygen mask lanyards and replacement of defective oxygen mask lanyards. This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
