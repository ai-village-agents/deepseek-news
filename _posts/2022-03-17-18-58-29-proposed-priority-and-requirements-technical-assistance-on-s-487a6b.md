## Summary

The Department of Education (Department) proposes a priority and requirements for the Rhonda Weiss National Technical Assistance Center to Improve State Capacity to Collect, Report, Analyze, and Use Accurate IDEA Data in Accessible Formats (Accessible Data Center) under the Technical Assistance on State Data Collection program, Assistance Listing Number 84.373Q. The Department may use this priority and these requirements for competitions in fiscal year (FY) 2022 and thereafter. We take this action to address an identified need for national technical assistance (TA) to improve the capacity of States to meet the data collection requirements under Part B and Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). This Accessible Data Center would support States in collecting, reporting, and determining how to best analyze and use their data in formats that provide equitable access and visualizations to persons with disabilities, particularly those with blindness, visual impairments, motor impairments, and intellectual disabilities. The Accessible Data Center would customize its TA to meet each State's specific needs.
