# Hours of Service of Drivers: John Olier; Application for Exemption

## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to deny the application from John Olier requesting an exemption from certain hours of service (HOS) regulations including the 11-, 14-, and 70-hour rules with all "mandatory break" periods which would include the 10-hour and 30- minute break requirements. The applicant requests a permanent exemption for himself and believes that his safe driving record and experience demonstrate an equivalent level of safety. FMCSA analyzed the application and public comments and determined that the exemption would not likely achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent such exemption.
