## Summary

The purpose of the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) Evaluation is to assess the effect of the RAD program. This evaluation will assess the implementation and effect of the choice mobility option on properties, tenants, and the voucher program; the impact of RAD on the long-term preservation and financial viability of converted properties; the adequacy of asset management for RAD conversions; PHA's organizational change; and other RAD tenant protections and outcomes. This System of Records pertains primarily to the choice mobility component of the study, specifically the aspect of that component that evaluates the effect of the choice mobility option on tenant outcomes, but also includes some of the other components of the study. The study will use HUD administrative data to determine which residents lived in a RAD-converted property and are eligible for the RAD choice mobility option and are still residents at those properties or have since left the property using a tenant-based voucher. The study includes a census of residents who used the choice mobility option and a survey of residents eligible to use the choice mobility option but remained in their RAD-converted developments. The study will also collect PII on property owners/managers, including their names and contact information, to survey them about the impact of RAD on long-term preservation, financial viability, and asset management.
