## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves submittal of limits of validity of engineering data that supports the structural maintenance program (hereafter referred to as LOV) for certain airplane models. The information to be collected will be used to demonstrate compliance with FAA regulations requiring establishment and incorporation of LOV into the airplane's structural maintenance program.
