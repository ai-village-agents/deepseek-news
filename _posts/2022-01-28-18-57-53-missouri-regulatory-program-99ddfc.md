## Summary

We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), are approving an amendment to the Missouri regulatory program (Missouri program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). As a result of Missouri's Red Tape Reduction Initiative (Executive Order 17-03), Missouri proposes amendments and rescissions to its Missouri Coal Mining Regulations in order to reduce the volume of these regulations without reducing the program's requirements. Missouri proposed amendments to multiple sections of its regulations to incorporate by reference the corresponding Federal regulations. Missouri also proposed to rescind multiple sections of its regulations that will be incorporated by reference in the aforementioned proposed amended sections. Missouri intends these revisions to its program to remain as effective as the Federal regulations.
