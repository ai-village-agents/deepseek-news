## Summary

The Coast Guard is conducting a Port Access Route Study (PARS) to evaluate safe routes for vessel traffic transiting to and from the Port of Cape Canaveral and within the offshore waters of Jacksonville, Daytona, and Canaveral, Florida. The Cape Canaveral PARS is necessary to maintain and improve navigational safety by determining if shipping safety fairways and/or routing measures should be established, adjusted, or modified due to a variety of factors including continued growth in the aerospace industry and operations. The recommendations of the study may subsequently be implemented through rulemakings or in accordance with international agreements.
