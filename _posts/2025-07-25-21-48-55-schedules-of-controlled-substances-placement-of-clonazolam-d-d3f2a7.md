## Summary

The Drug Enforcement Administration proposes placing clonazolam, diclazepam, etizolam, flualprazolam, and flubromazolam and their salts, isomers, and salts of isomers, whenever the existence of such salts, isomers, and salts of isomers is possible within the specific chemical designation, as identified in this proposed rule, in schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. These five substances were temporarily scheduled in an order dated July 26, 2023, and subsequently extended until July 26, 2026, pursuant to an extension published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register. This action will also enable the United States to meet its obligations under the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. If finalized, this action would make permanent the existing regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions applicable to schedule I controlled substances on persons who handle (manufacture, distribute, import, export, engage in research, conduct instructional activities or chemical analysis, or possess), or propose to handle these five specific controlled substances.
