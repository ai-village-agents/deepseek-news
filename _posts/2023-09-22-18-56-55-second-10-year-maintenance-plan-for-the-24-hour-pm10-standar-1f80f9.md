## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve the "Second 10-Year PM<INF>10</INF> Maintenance Plan for Sacramento County" ("Second 10-Year Maintenance Plan" or "Plan") as a revision to the state implementation plan (SIP) for the State of California ("State"). The Second 10-Year Maintenance Plan includes, among other elements, a base year emissions inventory, a maintenance demonstration, contingency provisions, and motor vehicle emissions budgets for use in transportation conformity determinations, to ensure the continued maintenance of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter of 10 microns or less (PM<INF>10</INF>). With this proposed rulemaking, the EPA is beginning the adequacy process for the 2024, 2027, and 2033 motor vehicle emissions budgets. Additionally, as part of the technical basis for this approval, the EPA is taking comment on our August 1, 2022 concurrence on the wildfire exceptional events demonstration submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) on April 26, 2021.
