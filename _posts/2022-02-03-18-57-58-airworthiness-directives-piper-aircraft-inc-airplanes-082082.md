## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Piper Aircraft, Inc., (Piper) Model PA-34-200 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by the determination that the life limit for alternate bolts that attach the drag link to the nose gear were not listed as airworthiness limitations. This proposed AD would require establishing a life limit for these bolts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
