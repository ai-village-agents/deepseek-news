## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-23- 09, which applied to all Embraer S.A. Model ERJ 190-400 airplanes. AD 2023-23-09 required repetitive inspections of the press-fitted bushings of the wing ailerons for migration and broken sealant, measurements of the distance between the aileron surfaces and hinge fittings, functional checks of the backlash of the wing aileron control system, and all applicable related investigative and corrective actions. Since the FAA issued AD 2023-23-09, it was determined that certain requirements needed to be clarified. This AD continues to require all actions of ANAC AD 2023-05-02 with revised compliance requirements, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
