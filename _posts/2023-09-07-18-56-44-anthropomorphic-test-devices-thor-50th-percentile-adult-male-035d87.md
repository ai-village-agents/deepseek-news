## Summary

This document proposes to amend NHTSA's regulations to include an advanced crash test dummy, the Test Device for Human Occupant Restraint (THOR) 50th percentile adult male (THOR-50M). The dummy represents an adult male of roughly average height and weight and is designed for use in frontal crash tests. NHTSA plans to issue a separate NPRM to amend Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 208, "Occupant crash protection," to specify the THOR-50M as an alternative (at the vehicle manufacturer's option) to the 50th percentile adult male dummy currently specified in FMVSS No. 208 for use in frontal crash compliance tests.
