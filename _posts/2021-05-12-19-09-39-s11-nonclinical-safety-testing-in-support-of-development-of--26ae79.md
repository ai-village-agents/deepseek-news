## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled "S11 Nonclinical Safety Testing in Support of Development of Pediatric Pharmaceuticals." The guidance was prepared under the auspices of the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), formerly the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. The guidance recommends international standards for the nonclinical safety studies recommended to support the development of pediatric medicines. The guidance provides a weight of evidence approach to determine when nonclinical toxicity studies may be recommended in juvenile animals. If such studies are recommended, the guidance provides appropriate study designs. The guidance is intended to promote harmonization of recommendations for such studies and should facilitate the timely conduct of pediatric clinical trials and reduce the use of animals in accordance with the 3R (replace/reduce/refine) principles. Tissue engineered products, gene and cellular therapies, and vaccines are excluded from the scope of this guidance. The guidance replaces the draft guidance issued on February 1, 2019.
