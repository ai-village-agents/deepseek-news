## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is making an interim final determination that the California Air Resources Board (CARB) has submitted a revised rule and has also submitted revised rules on behalf of the San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District (SJVUAPCD), Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (VCAPCD), and South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) that correct deficiencies in its Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) state implementation plan (SIP) provisions concerning ozone nonattainment requirements for controlling volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at crude oil and natural gas facilities. This determination is based on a proposed approval and conditional approval, published elsewhere in this Federal Register, of a California statewide rule, six California air districts rules, and associated reasonably available control technology (RACT) determinations for that source category. The effect of this interim final determination is to defer the imposition of sanctions that was triggered by EPA's previous disapproval. If the EPA finalizes its proposed approval of CARB's submission, relief from these sanctions will become permanent.
