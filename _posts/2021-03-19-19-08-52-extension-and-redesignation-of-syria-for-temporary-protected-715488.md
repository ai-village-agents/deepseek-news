## Summary

Through this notice, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announces that the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) is extending the designation of Syria for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 18 months, from March 31, 2021 through September 30, 2022 and redesignating Syria for 18 months, effective March 31, 2021 through September 30, 2022. The extension allows currently eligible TPS beneficiaries to retain TPS through September 30, 2022, so long as they otherwise continue to meet the eligibility requirements for TPS. The redesignation of Syria allows additional individuals who have been continuously residing in the United States since March 19, 2021 to obtain TPS, if otherwise eligible. Through this notice, DHS also sets forth procedures necessary for Syrian nationals (or noncitizens having no nationality who last habitually resided in Syria) either to re- register under the extension, if they already have TPS, and to apply for renewal of their Employment Authorization Documents (EAD) with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) or to submit an initial registration application under the redesignation and apply for an EAD.
