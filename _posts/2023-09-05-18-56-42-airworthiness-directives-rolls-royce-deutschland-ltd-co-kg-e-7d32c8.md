## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Model BR700-715A1-30, BR700- 715B1-30, and BR700-715C1-30 engines. This AD was prompted by reports of malformed scallop edge geometry and surface conditions at the front flange scallops of affected low-pressure compressor (LPC) booster rotors. This AD requires repetitive fluorescent penetrant inspections (FPIs) of the front flange scallops of the LPC booster rotor for any cracks, replacement or repair of the LPC booster rotor if necessary and, as an optional terminating action to the repetitive FPIs, a visual inspection for malformed scallop edge geometry and malformed surface conditions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference (IBR). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
