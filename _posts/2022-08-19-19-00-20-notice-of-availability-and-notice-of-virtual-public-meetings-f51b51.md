## Summary

Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, Council on Environmental Quality implementing regulations and a Presidential Executive Order, DoN, with United States (U.S.) Department of Energy (DOE) as a cooperating agency, has prepared and filed with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) a Draft Environmental Impact Statement/Overseas Environmental Impact Statement (EIS/OEIS) for the Disposal of Decommissioned, Defueled Ex-Enterprise (CVN 65) and its Associated Naval Reactor Plants. The Draft EIS/OEIS includes an analysis of the potential environmental impacts associated with alternatives for the disposal of ex-Enterprise, including its defueled reactor plants. The Proposed Action executes the statutory responsibilities of the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program (NNPP) and Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) policy for inactive ships stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and designated for disposal by dismantling in order to reduce DoN inactive ship inventory and eliminate costs associated with maintaining the ship in a safe stowage condition.
