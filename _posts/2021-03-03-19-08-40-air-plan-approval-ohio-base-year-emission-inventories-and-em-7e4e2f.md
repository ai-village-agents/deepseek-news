## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving, under the Clean Air Act (CAA), a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency on July 24, 2020. The CAA establishes emission inventory requirements for all ozone nonattainment areas. The revision addresses the emission inventory requirements for the Cleveland, Ohio (OH) ozone nonattainment area and the Ohio portion of the Cincinnati, Ohio-Kentucky (Cincinnati) ozone nonattainment area, as designated under the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS or standard). EPA is also confirming that Ohio's stationary annual emissions statement regulation, which has been previously approved by EPA under a prior ozone standard, satisfies the CAA emissions statement rule requirement for the Cleveland and Cincinnati nonattainment areas under the 2015 ozone NAAQS.
