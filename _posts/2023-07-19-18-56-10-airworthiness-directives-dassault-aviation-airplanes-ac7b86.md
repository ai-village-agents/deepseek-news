## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-03-24, which applies certain Dassault Aviation Model MYSTERE- FALCON 20-C5, 20-D5, 20-E5, and 20-F5 airplanes. AD 2020-03-24 requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-03-24, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2020-03-24 and require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
