## Summary

The Maritime Administration (MARAD) invites public comments on our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The information collected will be used to determine if waivers and deferments may be granted to U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) graduates and to State Maritime Academy (SMA) graduates who participated in the Student Incentive Payment (SIP) Program. We are required to publish this notice in the Federal Register by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
