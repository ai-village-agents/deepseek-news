# Update of Existing FMC User Fees

**Published:** February 05, 2026 18:55 UTC

**Document Number:** 2023-13378

## Summary

On March 21, 2023, the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) published in the Federal Register a direct final rule and request for comment updating its user fees. The document inadvertently stated an incorrect amount for two fees. The document stated as the cost for certification/validation of documents as $93 instead of $107, and for Non-Attorney Admission to Practice as $195 instead of $229. This document corrects the error by aligning the fees as stated in the rule with those that were correctly identified in the 2023-3-07FY23 User Fee Control File provided in the docket as a supporting document.
