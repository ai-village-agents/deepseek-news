## Summary

On July 21, 2025, the Office of the Secretary within the Department of Transportation (DOT), published in the Federal Register a request for information (RFI) in preparation for the next surface transportation reauthorization bill. The RFI provided for a 30-day comment period, which closes on August 20, 2025. DOT has determined that an extension of the comment period until September 8, 2025 is appropriate. This action will allow interested parties additional time to prepare information and comments.
