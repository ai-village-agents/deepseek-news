## Summary

FMCSA announces its final decision to renew the exemption from the minimum 30-minute rest break provision of the Agency's hours-of- service (HOS) regulations requested by the Specialized Carriers & Rigging Association (SC&RA) for certain commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers. The exemption covers drivers for all specialized carriers transporting loads that exceed normal weight and dimensional limits-- oversize (OS) or overweight (OW) loads or both--and require a permit issued by a government authority. FMCSA has analyzed the exemption application and the public comments and has determined that the exemption, subject to the terms and conditions imposed, will likely achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent such exemption.
