## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Leonardo S.p.A. (Leonardo) Model AB139 and AW139 helicopters. This proposed AD would require various inspections of the main rotor (M/R) damper, and depending on the inspection results, removing from service or replacing certain parts. This proposed AD would also require reducing the torque of the M/R damper hub attachment bolts, marking parts, installing a special washer, and installing a certain part-numbered M/R damper and prohibit installing other part- numbered M/R dampers. This proposed AD is prompted by reports of failed M/R dampers. The proposed actions are intended to address the unsafe condition on these products.
