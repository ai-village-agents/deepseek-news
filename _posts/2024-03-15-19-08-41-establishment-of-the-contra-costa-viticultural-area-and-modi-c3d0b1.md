## Summary

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) establishes the approximately 167,146-acre "Contra Costa" American viticultural area in Contra Costa County, California. Additionally, TTB is expanding the boundaries of the established San Francisco Bay and Central Coast viticultural areas to avoid a partial overlap with the Contra Costa viticultural area and instead encompass the entire Contra Costa AVA. TTB designates viticultural areas to allow vintners to better describe the origin of their wines and to allow consumers to better identify wines they may purchase.
