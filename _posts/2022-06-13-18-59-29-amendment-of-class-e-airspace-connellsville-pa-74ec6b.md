## Summary

This action amends the Class E airspace at Connellsville, PA. The FAA is taking this action as the result of an airspace review caused by the decommissioning of the Indian Head VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) navigation aids as part of the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program. The name and geographic coordinates of the airport are also being updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
