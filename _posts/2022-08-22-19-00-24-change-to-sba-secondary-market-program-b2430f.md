## Summary

The purpose of this Notice is to inform the public that the Small Business Administration (SBA) is making a change to its Secondary Market Loan Pooling Program. SBA is decreasing the minimum maturity ratio for both SBA Standard Pools and Weighted-Average Coupon (WAC) Pools by 100 basis points, to 92.0%. The change described in this Notice is being made to cover the estimated cost of the timely payment guaranty for newly formed SBA 7(a) loan pools. This change will be incorporated, as needed, into the SBA Secondary Market Program Guide and all other appropriate SBA Secondary Market documents.
