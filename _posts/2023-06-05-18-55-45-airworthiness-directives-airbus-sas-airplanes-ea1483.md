## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-24- 13, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2019-24-13 required repetitive high-frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections for cracking of a stiffener of a certain lateral window frame, and applicable related investigative and corrective actions. This AD was prompted by a determination that certain inspection times need to be revised. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2019-24-13, with amended compliance times, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
