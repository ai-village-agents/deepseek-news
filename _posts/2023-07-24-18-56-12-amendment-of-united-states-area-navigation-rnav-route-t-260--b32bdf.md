## Summary

This action amends United States Area Navigation (RNAV) route T-260, in the vicinity of Nome, AK. The RNAV route amendments are necessary due to the planned decommissioning of the Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) portion of the Tin City, AK (TNC), NDB/Distance Measuring Equipment (NDB/DME) and the Point Hope, AK, (PHO) NDB. Although the Tin City, AK, (TNC) NDB will decommission, the co-located Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) will remain for use within the National Airspace System (NAS).
