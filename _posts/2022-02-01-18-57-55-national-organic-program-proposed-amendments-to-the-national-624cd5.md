## Summary

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) proposes amendments to the National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances (National List) section of the USDA's organic regulations to implement recommendations submitted to the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) by the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB). This rule proposes to add low-acyl gellan gum, a food additive used as a thickener, gelling agent, and stabilizer; and paper- based crop planting aids to the National List, along with a definition of paper-based crop planting aids. If finalized, low-acyl gellan gum would be allowed as an ingredient in processed organic products, and paper-based crop planting aids would be allowed in organic crop production. The rule also proposes the correction of a spelling error on the National List to change "wood resin" to "wood rosin".
