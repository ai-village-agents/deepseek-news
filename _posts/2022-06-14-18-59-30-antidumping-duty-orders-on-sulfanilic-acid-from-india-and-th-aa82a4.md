## Summary

On April 1, 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) initiated the fifth sunset reviews of the antidumping duty (AD) orders on sulfanilic acid from India and the People's Republic of China (China) and the countervailing duty (CVD) order on sulfanilic acid from India. Because no domestic interested party filed a timely notice of intent to participate in these sunset reviews, Commerce is revoking the AD orders on sulfanilic acid from India and China and the CVD order on sulfanilic acid from India.
