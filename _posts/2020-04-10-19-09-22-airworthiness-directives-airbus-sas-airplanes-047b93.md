## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes, Model A319-111, - 112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes, Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes, and Model A321-111, - 112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of crack findings in and around the fastener holes of the central and lateral window frame upper junction; those cracks were found on fastener holes outside of the inspection area specified in a certain airworthiness limitation item (ALI) task. This proposed AD would require repetitive inspections of the upper junction fastener holes at the lateral window frame for cracking; and for certain airplanes, repetitive inspections of the spotface around the fastener holes for cracking; and corrective actions if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which will be incorporated by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
