## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), have received an application from Andris Upitis (applicant) to amend an incidental take permit pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. The permit would continue to authorize take of the central distinct population segment (DPS) of the California tiger salamander and the California red-legged frog, incidental to construction of a single-family residence at 12 Rancho San Carlos (Ocho West). We invite public comment on the amendment request, which includes the applicant's original HCP. In accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, we have prepared a draft low-effect screening form supporting our preliminary determination that the proposed action qualifies for a categorical exclusion under NEPA. To make this determination, we reassessed our environmental action statement and low-effect screening form prepared for the current HCP, and this draft NEPA compliance documentation is also available for public review.
