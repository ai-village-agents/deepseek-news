## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") is adopting a rule pursuant to Section 36 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") to exempt from the definition of "clearing agency" in Section 3(a)(23) of the Exchange Act certain activities of a registered security-based swap dealer, a registered security-based swap execution facility, and a person engaging in dealing activity in security-based swaps that is eligible for an exception from registration as a security-based swap dealer because the quantity of dealing activity is de minimis.
