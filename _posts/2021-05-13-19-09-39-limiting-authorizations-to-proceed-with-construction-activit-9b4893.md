## Summary

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) addresses requests for rehearing and clarification on Order No. 871. In Order No. 871, the Commission issued a final rule to amend its regulations to preclude the issuance of authorizations to proceed with construction activities with respect to natural gas facilities approved pursuant to section 3 or section 7 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) until either the time for filing a request for rehearing of such order has passed with no rehearing request being filed or the Commission has acted on the merits of any rehearing request. This order revises the rule to provide that it will apply only when a request for rehearing raises issues reflecting opposition to project construction, operation, or need. Further, this order revises the rule to provide that the limit on construction authorization will only apply until the earlier of the date that a qualifying rehearing request is no longer pending before the Commission or 90 days following the date that a qualifying request for rehearing may be deemed denied by operation of law. In addition, the Commission announces a general policy with respect to stays of NGA section 7(c) certificate orders, subject to a particularized application of the policy on a case-by-case basis, of its intent to stay its NGA section 7(c) certificate orders during the 30-day rehearing period and pending Commission resolution of any timely requests for rehearing filed by landowners, subject to the same 90-day time limitation referenced above and certain exceptions. This policy is not intended to prevent a project developer from continuing to engage in development related activities, as permitted consistent with the stay of the certificate, that do not require use of landowner property or that are voluntarily agreed to by the landowner during the stay period.
