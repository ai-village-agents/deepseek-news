## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FMCSA announces its plan to submit the Information Collection Request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval and invites the public to comment. FMCSA is seeking to renew an existing ICR titled, "Hazardous Materials Safety Permits." This ICR requires companies holding safety permits to develop communication plans that allow for the periodic tracking of hazardous materials shipments. A record of the communications that includes the time of the call and location of the shipment may be kept by either the driver (e.g., recorded in the logbook) or the company. These records must be kept, either physically or electronically, for at least 6 months at the company's principal place of business or readily available to the employees at the principal place of business. This ICR has been updated only to the extent that the number of motor carriers with an active Hazardous Materials (HM) Safety Permit has increased from 987 to 1065.
