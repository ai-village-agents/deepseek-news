## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has received an application from Purdue University (Purdue or the applicant), to renew Special Nuclear Material (SNM) License Number 142 (SNM-142). The renewed license would authorize the applicant to continue to use SNM in various research operations, calibration, and testing at its campus in West Lafayette, Indiana. If the license renewal application is approved, the license would authorize Purdue to continue to possess and use SNM under NRC regulations for 10 years beyond its current license. Because the license application contains sensitive unclassified non- safeguards information (SUNSI) and safeguards information (SGI), an order imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI and SGI for contention preparation.
