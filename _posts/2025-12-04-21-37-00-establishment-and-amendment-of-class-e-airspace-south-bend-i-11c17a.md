## Summary

This action proposes to establish and amend the Class E airspace at South Bend, IN. The name and geographic coordinates of the South Bend International Airport, South Bend, IN, would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of airspace reviews conducted due to the decommissioning of the Keeler very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program. This action would bring the airspace into compliance with FAA orders and support instrument flight rule (IFR) procedures and operations.
