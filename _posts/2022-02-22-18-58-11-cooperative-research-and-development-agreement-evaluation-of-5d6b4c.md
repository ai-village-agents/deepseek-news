## Summary

The Coast Guard announces its intent to enter into a cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) to evaluate and potentially modify target classification technology used in conjunction with electro-optical/infra-red (E.O./IR) systems. The Coast Guard is currently considering partnering with Teledyne FLIR, Inc. and solicits public comment on the possible participation of other parties in the proposed CRADA, and the nature of that participation. The Coast Guard also invites other potential non-Federal participants, who have the interest and capability to bring similar contributions to this type of research, to consider submitting proposals for consideration in similar CRADAs.
