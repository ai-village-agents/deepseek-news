## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Gulfstream Aerospace LP (GALP) Model Gulfstream G280 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of the accumulation of water in electrical connectors located in the aft fuselage directly below the empennage, resulting in empennage flight control related crew alerting system (CAS) messages. This proposed AD would require retrofitting the flight controls empennage electrical harness. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
