## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a safety zone to be enforced in the event of hurricanes and tropical storms in the Sector North Carolina Captain of the Port (COTP) Zone. This action is necessary to ensure the safety of the waters of the Sector North Carolina COTP Zone. This proposed rulemaking would establish actions to be completed by industry and vessels in the COTP Zone prior to landfall of hurricanes and tropical storms threatening the State of North Carolina. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
