## Summary

The Office of Management and Budget OMB, through its Economic Classification Policy Committee (ECPC), is seeking comment on potential changes to the structure and content of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). There are seven parts in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section below. Part I provides background on NAICS. Part II includes a solicitation of proposals for new and emerging industries. Part III solicits public comments on the NAICS treatment of Electronic Shopping in Retail Trade. Part IV asks for comments on the concept of internet Publishing and Broadcasting and the potential to eliminate the industry in NAICS 2022. Part V solicits comments on a proposed revision to OMB's Statistical Policy Directive No. 8, Standard Industrial Classification of Establishments. Part VI requests comments on the advisability of withdrawing OMB Statistical Policy Directive No. 9, Standard Industrial Classification of Enterprises. Finally, Part VII presents notification of a method to publicize corrections for errors and omissions that are identified in NAICS. In soliciting comments about revising NAICS, the ECPC does not intend to open the entire classification system for substantial change in 2022. The ECPC will consider public comments and proposals for changes or modifications that advance the goals of NAICS as outlined in Part I of the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section below.
