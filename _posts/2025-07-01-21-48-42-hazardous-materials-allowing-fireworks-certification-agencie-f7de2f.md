## Summary

This NPRM proposes to expand the Fireworks Certification Agency's (FCA) authority to approve fireworks constructed to the APA 87-1A standard to include those fireworks constructed to the APA 87-1B and APA 87-1C standards. PHMSA is also proposing to revise its procedural regulations to facilitate new FCA authorizations. These proposed actions are intended to streamline PHMSA's fireworks approval process and provide the industry with regulatory flexibility.
