## Summary

The Rural Business-Cooperative Service, Rural Housing Service, and Rural Utilities Service, agencies that comprise the Rural Development Mission Area within the United States Department of Agriculture, published a notice of solicitation of applications in the Federal Register on January 11, 2021, entitled "Notice of Solicitation of Applications (NOSA) for the Strategic Economic and Community Development Program for Fiscal Year (FY) 2021." The NOSA provides requirements to applicants submitting applications for programs that have been prioritized by the Secretary of Agriculture for Strategic Economic and Community Development funding. Contrary to what was published in the NOSA, this Correction Notice (Correction) is being issued to clarify that Strategic Economic and Community Development priority funding will not be set aside for the Community Connect Grant Program in FY 2021.
