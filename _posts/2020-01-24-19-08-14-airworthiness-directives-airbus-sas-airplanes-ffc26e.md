## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of sealant bead damage caused by rotation of the attachment fitting bearing assembly of a trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS). This AD requires repetitive detailed inspections, and applicable corrective action(s) if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. In addition, as specified in the EASA AD, this AD provides an optional modification that would terminate the inspections. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
