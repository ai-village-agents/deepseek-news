## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its spent fuel regulations by revising the Westinghouse Electric Company LLC FuelSolutions<SUP>TM</SUP> Spent Fuel Management System listing within the "List of approved spent fuel storage casks" to renew the initial certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 through 4 to Certificate of Compliance No. 1026. The renewal of the initial certificate of compliance and Amendment Nos. 1 through 4 for 40 years would revise the certificate's conditions and technical specifications to address aging management activities related to the structures, systems, and components important to safety of the dry storage system to ensure that these will maintain their intended functions during the period of extended storage operations.
