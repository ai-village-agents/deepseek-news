## Summary

The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has received an incidental take permit (ITP) application from Port Blakely, associated with the Port Blakely Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) for the John Franklin Eddy Forestlands located in Clackamas County, Oregon. Port Blakely submitted the ITP application pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (ESA). The permit, if issued, would authorize incidental take of the covered species under NMFS jurisdiction resulting from the timber harvest, silviculture, and road management activities, as well as take resulting from activities carried out as part of the HCP's conservation strategy on the John Franklin Eddy Forestlands for a permit term of 50 years. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (NEPA), NMFS announces the availability of a draft environmental assessment (Draft EA). NMFS is the lead Federal agency under NEPA, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) is a cooperating agency. The Draft EA analyzes the potential effects of issuance of the ITPs and approval of the HCP.
