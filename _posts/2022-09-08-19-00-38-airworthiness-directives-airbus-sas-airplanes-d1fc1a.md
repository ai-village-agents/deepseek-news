## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report indicating that the inflatable free aisle restrictor (IFAR) on certain single lane slide-rafts demonstrated inconsistent release behavior in aft wind conditions. This AD requires replacing an affected part with a serviceable part, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also prohibits the installation of affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
