## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing a limited approval and limited disapproval of a revision to the California Air Resources Board (CARB) portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revision concerns emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from vapor recovery systems of gasoline cargo tanks. Under the authority of the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), this action simultaneously approves the rescission of a different statewide rule from the California SIP that previously regulated this emission source.
