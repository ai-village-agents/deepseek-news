## Summary

On January 28, 2022, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), with the approval of the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, issued a Finding that certain palm oil and derivative products made wholly or in part with palm oil produced by Sime Darby Plantation Berhad, its subsidiaries, and joint ventures, were being produced with the use of forced labor, and were being, or were likely to be, imported into the United States. CBP has now determined, based upon additional information, that such merchandise is no longer being produced with the use of forced labor in violation of section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended.
