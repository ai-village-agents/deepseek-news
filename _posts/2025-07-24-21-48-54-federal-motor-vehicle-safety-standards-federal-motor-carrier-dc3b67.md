## Summary

FMCSA and NHTSA withdraw the September 7, 2016 joint NPRM that proposed to require that heavy vehicles (those with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of more than 11,793 kilograms (26,000 pounds)) be equipped with a speed limiting device that is maintained at a set speed. FMCSA also withdraws its May 4, 2022 ANSPRM, which announced FMCSA's intent to proceed with a speed limiter rulemaking. The ANSPRM stated that FMCSA was preparing a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) to propose that motor carriers operating commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) in interstate commerce with a gross vehicle weight or GVWR of at least 11,794 kilograms (26,001 pounds), whichever is greater, and that are equipped with an engine control unit (ECU) capable of governing the maximum speed, be required to limit the CMV to a speed to be determined by the rulemaking and to maintain that ECU setting for the service life of the vehicle. In light of significant policy and safety concerns and continued data gaps that create considerable uncertainty about the estimated costs, benefits, and other impacts of the proposed rule, FMCSA and NHTSA have decided to withdraw the proposal.
