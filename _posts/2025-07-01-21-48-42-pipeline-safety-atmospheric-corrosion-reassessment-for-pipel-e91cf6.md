## Summary

PHMSA is proposing to revise the corrosion requirements in 49 CFR part 192 for gas distribution systems by replacing the 3-year reassessment interval with a 5-year reassessment interval following the replacement of pipeline segments or components in service lines. This change would provide cost savings to gas distribution operators.
