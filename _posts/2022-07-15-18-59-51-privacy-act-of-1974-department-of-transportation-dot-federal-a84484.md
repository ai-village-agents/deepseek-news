## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Transportation (DOT) proposes a new system of records titled "Safe Driver Apprenticeship Pilot" (SDAP) Program. This system of records will allow DOT to collect and maintain records on safety performance and driving profiles of certain Commercial Motor Vehicle (CMV) drivers voluntarily participating in the SDAP program and receiving an exemption to operate in interstate commerce before reaching the age of 21. The information in the system will be used to analyze the safety performance of apprenticeship drivers as compared to current CMV drivers operating in intra- or inter-state commerce under current FMCSA regulations. This system maintains records on carriers, experienced drivers, and apprentice drivers who volunteer to participate in the SDAP. Records on carriers and experienced drivers are limited to those necessary to verify qualifications for participation, while records on apprentice drivers include safety, performance, and exposure data throughout their participation as an apprentice.
