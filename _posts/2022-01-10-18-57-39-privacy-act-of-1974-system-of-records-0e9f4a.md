## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to establish a new Department of Homeland Security system of records titled, "Department of Homeland Security/Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-016 Disaster Case Management Files System of Records." This system of records allows the Department of Homeland Security/Federal Emergency Management Agency to collect and maintain records on survivors of a Presidentially-declared major disaster with Individual Assistance (IA) authorized (as documented in the declaration published in the Federal Register) who participate in Federal Emergency Management Agency-administered Disaster Case Management (DCM) Programs. This newly established system will be included in the Department of Homeland Security's inventory of record systems.
