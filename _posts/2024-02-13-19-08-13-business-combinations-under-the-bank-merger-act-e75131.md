## Summary

The OCC is inviting comment on a proposed rule to increase the transparency of the standards that apply to the agency's review of business combinations involving national banks and Federal savings associations. In particular, the proposed rule would amend the procedures and would add, as an appendix, a policy statement that summarizes the principles the OCC uses when it reviews proposed bank merger transactions under the Bank Merger Act.
