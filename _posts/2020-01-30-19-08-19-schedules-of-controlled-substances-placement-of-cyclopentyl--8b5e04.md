## Summary

The Drug Enforcement Administration proposes placing cyclopentyl fentanyl (N-(1-phenethylpiperidin-4-yl)-N- phenylcyclopentanecarboxamide), isobutyryl fentanyl (N-(1- phenethylpiperidin-4-yl)-N-phenylisobutyramide), para-chloroisobutyryl fentanyl (N-(4-chlorophenyl)-N-(1-phenethylpiperidin-4- yl)isobutyramide), para-methoxybutyryl fentanyl (N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N- (1-phenethylpiperidin-4-yl)butyramide), and valeryl fentanyl (N-(1- phenethylpiperidin-4-yl)-N-phenylpentanamide), including their isomers, esters, ethers, salts, and salts of isomers, esters and ethers whenever the existence of such isomers, esters, ethers and salts is possible, in schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. If finalized, this action would make permanent the existing regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions applicable to schedule I controlled substances on persons who handle (manufacture, distribute, import, export, engage in research, conduct instructional activities or chemical analysis, or possess), or propose to handle cyclopentyl fentanyl, isobutyryl fentanyl, para-chloroisobutyryl fentanyl, para- methoxybutyryl fentanyl, and valeryl fentanyl.
