## Summary

Notice is being given that the FAA is considering a request from the City of Manchester to dispose of 9.97 acres of land at Manchester-Boston Regional Airport, Manchester, NH. The disposal of the 5 parcels corrects a 100-year lease that produced no revenue stream for the properties over the term of the lease. The 5 parcels are not required for existing or future aviation development and are currently developed as non-aeronautical uses. As such, the disposal will not affect the airport's future development needs. The land disposal proceeds will be deposited in the airport's operation and maintenance account.
