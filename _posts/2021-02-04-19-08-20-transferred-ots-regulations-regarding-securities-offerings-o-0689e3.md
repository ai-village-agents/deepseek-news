## Summary

In order to streamline Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) regulations and guidance, the FDIC proposes to rescind and remove from the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) rules entitled Securities Offerings that were transferred to the FDIC from the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) on July 21, 2011, in connection with the implementation of Title III of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). The FDIC also is proposing to rescind its Statement of Policy Regarding the Use of Offering Circulars in Connection with the Public Distribution of Bank Securities, which provides a guide for a State nonmember banks and other institutions in the preparation of offering circulars. At the same time, the FDIC is proposing a new regulation regarding securities disclosures to be made by State nonmember banks and State savings associations (FDIC- supervised institutions). In so doing, the FDIC would create a unified scheme for securities disclosure requirements applicable to FDIC- supervised institutions. The proposal also would include technical amendments to update related regulations.
