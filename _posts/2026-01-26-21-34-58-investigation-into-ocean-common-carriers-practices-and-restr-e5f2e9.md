## Summary

The Federal Maritime Commission is investigating reports that ocean common carriers may be in violation of the Shipping Act by unjustly and unreasonably restricting truckers and shippers from negotiating and dealing with chassis providers through service contract terms or other means, and seeks information from shippers, motor carriers, and other transportation service providers as well as the public about whether such practices are occurring and if so, how they are affecting the ocean supply chain.
