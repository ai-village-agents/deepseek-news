## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the Missouri State Implementation Plan (SIP) relating to General Conformity received on April 15, 2022. In its submission, Missouri requests EPA approval of rescission of the Missouri General Conformity Rule from the Missouri SIP. General Conformity ensures actions taken by federal agencies, such as airport construction, do not interfere with a state's plans to attain and maintain national standards for air quality. After rescission of the state's General Conformity Rule, federal agency actions will be subject to the Federal General Conformity Rule.
