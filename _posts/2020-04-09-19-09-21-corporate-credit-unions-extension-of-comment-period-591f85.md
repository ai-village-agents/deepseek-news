## Summary

On March 27, 2020, the NCUA Board (Board) published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Federal Register requesting comment on the Board's proposal to amend the NCUA's corporate credit union regulation (proposed rule). The proposed rule would update, clarify, and simplify several provisions of the NCUA's corporate credit union regulation. The proposed rule provided a 60-day comment period that was set to close on May 26, 2020. To allow interested persons more time to consider and submit their comments, the Board has determined that an extension of the comment period for an additional 60 days is appropriate.
