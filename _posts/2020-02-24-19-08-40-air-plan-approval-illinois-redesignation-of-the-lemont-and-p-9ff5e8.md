## Summary

In accordance with the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to redesignate the Lemont and Pekin sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) nonattainment areas from nonattainment to attainment. EPA is also proposing to approve Illinois' maintenance plans for these two areas. Emissions of SO<INF>2</INF> in the areas have been reduced, and the air quality in the two areas is currently better than the SO<INF>2</INF> national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS).
