## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing for public comment draft Interim Staff Guidance (ISG) ``Use of the Decommissioning Trust Fund During Operations for Major Radioactive Component Disposal.'' The purpose of this proposed ISG is to provide the NRC staff's regulatory position to licensees of nuclear power reactors regarding the use of funds from the decommissioning trust fund dedicated to the radiological decommissioning of a reactor facility for the disposal of major radioactive components (MRCs) while the facility is in an operational status. This proposed ISG may be used in connection with requests for exemption from NRC regulations related to the withdrawal of funds from reactor decommissioning trust funds (DTFs).
