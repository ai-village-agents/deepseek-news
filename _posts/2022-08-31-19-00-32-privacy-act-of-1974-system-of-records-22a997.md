## Summary

The United States Postal Service [supreg] (USPS[supreg] or Postal Service) is proposing to create a new Customer Privacy Act System of Records (SOR) to support an initiative to centralize Commercial Mail Receiving Agency (CMRA) records into an electronic database, improve the security of the In-Person enrollment process, and consolidate all CMRA paper and electronic records under one new and dedicated SOR. Previous Federal Register Notices for CMRA records that covered the current manual paper record system were published as USPS SOR 840.000, Customer Mailing and Delivery Instructions.
