## Summary

This final rule adds new test requirements to the airworthiness regulation addressing engine bird ingestion. The new test requirements ensure that turbofan engines can ingest the largest medium flocking bird (MFB) into the engine core at climb or approach conditions. To obtain certification of a turbofan engine, a manufacturer must show the engine core can continue to operate after ingesting such a bird while operating at a lower fan speed associated with climb or approach.
