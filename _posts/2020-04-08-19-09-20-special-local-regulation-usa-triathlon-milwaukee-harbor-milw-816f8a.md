## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary special local regulation for certain waters of the Milwaukee Harbor. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters within the Lake Shore State Park Lagoon during a triathlon swim event taking place from August 7, 2020 through August 9, 2020. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the regulated area unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Lake Michigan or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
