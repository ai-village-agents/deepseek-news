## Summary

In this document, the Commission announces that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the information collection requirements under OMB Control Numbers 3060-1121, 3060-1320, 3060-0009, 3060-0386, 3060-0175, 3060-0178, 3060-0182, 3060-0190, 3060-0320, 3060- 0113, and 3060-1321 associated with the rules adopted in the Report and Order, FCC 23-72, adopting several rule updates for full power and Class A television stations that no longer have any practical effect given the completion of the transition from analog to digital-only operations and the post incentive auction transition to a smaller television band with fewer channels. This document is consistent with the Report and Order, which states that the Media Bureau will publish a document in the Federal Register announcing the effective date for these revised rule sections and revising the rules accordingly.
