## Summary

The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) is proposing changes to requirements for the Public Transportation Safety Certification Training Program (PTSCTP). The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, enacted as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), established new requirements for FTA's Public Transportation Safety Program that relate to PTSCTP requirements. The proposed revisions would streamline the PTSCTP communication process and clarify voluntary PTSCTP participation and refresher training requirements. FTA seeks comments from project sponsors, the transit industry, unions, other stakeholders, and the public on the proposed changes to the regulation.
