## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 767-200, 767-300, 767-300F, and 767-400ER airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a heavy maintenance check that found corrosion damage on a Model 767 satellite communications (SATCOM) high gain antenna adapter plate. This proposed AD would require repetitive detailed inspections (DET) of the SATCOM high gain antenna adapter plate for corrosion and applicable on- condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
