## Summary

On February 4, 2022, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), published in the Federal Register a proposed supervisory framework for depository institution holding companies that are significantly engaged in insurance activities, or supervised insurance organizations. The Board has determined that an extension of the comment period until May 5, 2022, is appropriate, and is therefore making that extension.
