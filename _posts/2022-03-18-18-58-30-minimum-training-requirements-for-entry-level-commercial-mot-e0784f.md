## Summary

FMCSA removes obsolete regulatory text from its June 30, 2021, entry-level driver training (ELDT) final rule. The section-by-section analysis in the March 7, 2016 notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) concerning the ELDT requirements proposed that, upon the effective date of the final rule, the subpart setting out the old driver training standards would be removed from the regulations and the subpart reserved for future use. However, the Agency omitted the amendatory instruction needed to remove and reserve the subpart from the December 8, 2016 final rule. FMCSA corrects the omission, which was repeated in subsequent ELDT rulemaking notices, the most recent being the June 2021 final rule.
