## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all airplanes with certain Pacific Scientific Company rotary buckle assemblies (buckles) installed. This AD was prompted by a report of a manufacturing defect in the screws used inside the buckle. This proposed AD would require inspecting the buckle screws, and depending on the results, reidentifying the buckle, replacing the screws and reidentifying the buckle, or replacing the buckle. This proposed AD would also prohibit installing certain buckles. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
