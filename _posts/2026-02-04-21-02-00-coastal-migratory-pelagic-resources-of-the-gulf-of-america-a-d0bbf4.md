## Summary

NMFS closes commercial harvest for the Atlantic migratory group of Spanish mackerel in the southern zone. NMFS projects that landings of Spanish mackerel will soon reach the commercial quota for the Atlantic southern zone in the 2025-2026 fishing year. Accordingly, NMFS closes the Atlantic southern zone to commercial harvest of Spanish mackerel. This closure is necessary to protect the Spanish mackerel resource in the Atlantic.
