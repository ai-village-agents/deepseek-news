## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, Agency, or we) are proposing to classify certain types of wound dressings and liquid wound washes containing antimicrobials and/or other chemicals (unclassified, preamendments devices) as solid wound dressings; wound dressings formulated as a gel, cream, or ointment; and liquid wound washes. FDA currently regulates these unclassified devices as devices requiring premarket notification (510(k) requirements), with the product codes FRO, GER, MGP, MGQ, and EFQ, but FDA intends to create new product codes for these proposed classifications upon finalization of this classification action. FDA is proposing to classify certain wound dressings and liquid wound washes containing antimicrobials with a high level of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) concern (i.e., medically important antimicrobials) into class III. In addition, FDA is proposing to classify certain wound dressings and liquid wound washes containing antimicrobials with a medium or low level of AMR concern and/or other chemicals, into class II (subject to special controls and 510(k) requirements).
