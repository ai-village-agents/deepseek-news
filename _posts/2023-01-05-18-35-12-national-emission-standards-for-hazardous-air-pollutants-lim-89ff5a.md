## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing amendments to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Lime Manufacturing Plants (Lime Manufacturing NESHAP), as required by the Clean Air Act (CAA). To ensure that all emissions of HAP from sources in the source category are regulated, the EPA is proposing hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions standards for the following pollutants: hydrogen chloride (HCl), mercury, total hydrocarbon (THC) as a surrogate for organic HAP, and dioxin/furans (D/ F).
