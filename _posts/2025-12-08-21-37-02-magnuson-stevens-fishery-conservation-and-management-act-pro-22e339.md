## Summary

NMFS proposes regulations to implement specifications and management measures in Framework Adjustment 69 to the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan, except for measures specific to Atlantic cod; approve Northeast multispecies (groundfish) sectors and allocations; establish recreational measures for several stocks; update common pool possession limits; and clarify and correct existing regulations. This action is necessary to respond to updated scientific information and achieve the goals and objectives of the fishery management plan. The proposed measures are intended to help prevent overfishing, rebuild overfished stocks, achieve optimum yield, and ensure that management measures are based on the best scientific information available.
