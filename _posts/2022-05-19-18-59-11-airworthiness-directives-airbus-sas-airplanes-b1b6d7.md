## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A330-200, A330-200 Freighter, A330-300, and A330-900 series airplanes; and all Model A340-200 and A340-300 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by recent tests that demonstrated that when the upper secondary load path (SLP) of the trimmable horizontal stabilizer actuator (THSA) is engaged, the THSA might not stall, with consequently no indication of SLP engagement. This proposed AD would require modifying the THSA installation, implementing the electrical load sensing device (ELSD) wiring provisions, and installing and activating the ELSD, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
