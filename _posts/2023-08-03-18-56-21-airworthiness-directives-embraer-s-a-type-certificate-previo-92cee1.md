## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Embraer S.A. Model ERJ 190-300 and -400 airplanes. This AD was prompted by identification that, during simulations, analysis, and an in-service event of the airplane, a stall warning system activation (i.e., stick shaker) and angle of attack (AOA) limiter engagement may occur in certain vertical gust conditions with specific intensity and frequency. This AD requires revising the Limitations section of the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to incorporate minimum operating speeds during flight at moderate or severe turbulence conditions, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
