## Summary

USAID's Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (USAID/BHA) proposes to survey all members of its workforce to assess and gauge its processes for developing and improving a more cohesive BHA culture. This survey is also sent to institutional support contractors (ISCs), which are part of the USAID workforce but are members of the public for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA). USAID/BHA invites the general public and other Federal agencies to take this opportunity to comment on the following new information collection as it relates to ISCs, as required by the PRA. Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information collection should be sent within 30 days of publication of this notice to www.reginfo.gov/public/ do/PRAMain. Find this particular information collection by selecting "Currently under 30-day Review--Open for Public Comments" or by using the search function.
