## Summary

This Public Land Order (PLO) extends the withdrawal created by PLO No. 6244, as extended by PLO No. 7514, which would otherwise expire on May 12, 2022, for an additional 20-year term. PLO No. 6244 withdrew approximately 3,264.32 acres of public land, known as the Davis Range Tract M, from operation of surface land and mining laws, but not mineral leasing, and reserved for use by the Department of the Air Force for cold weather survival and infantry tactical training purposes in Fort Richardson, Alaska. PLO No. 7514 extended PLO No. 6244 for an additional 20-year term. This PLO also corrects the acreage in PLO 6244 and gives effect to the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) recommendation and subsequent creation of Joint Base Elmendorf- Richardson in 2010, with the Department of the Air Force as the supporting agency.
