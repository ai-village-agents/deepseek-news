These actions relate to CADOT's right of way (ROW) involved in the proposed light rail transit (LRT) line that will extend through southeast Los Angeles County. The project will encroach onto CADOT ROW at four freeways: Interstate (I) 605, State Route (SR) 91, I-710 via an at-grade configuration, and I-105 via an aerial configuration.
