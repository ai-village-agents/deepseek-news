## Summary

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is amending its regulatory description of the agency's seal. Since the seal's inception, the agency has utilized various versions of the seal. For consistency, the agency proposes updating the regulation and codifying current agency practice. This proposed change will provide a revised graphical representation of the seal. Additionally, the NTSB is including non-substantive technical amendments throughout part 803 due to recent internal organizational changes and a typographical error reflected in the agency's mailing address.
