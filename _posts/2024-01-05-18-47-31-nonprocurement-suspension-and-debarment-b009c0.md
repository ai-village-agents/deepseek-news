## Summary

The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) invites the general public and other Federal agencies to take this opportunity to comment on proposed nonprocurement debarment and suspension regulations. Under this system, a person who is debarred or suspended is excluded from Federal financial and nonfinancial assistance and benefits under Federal programs and activities. The proposed regulations adopt the common rule format established by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In this document DFC proposes establishing a new CFR chapter that adopts OMB's final Governmentwide guidance on nonprocurement debarment and suspension and contains supplemental DFC nonprocurement debarment and suspension provisions.
