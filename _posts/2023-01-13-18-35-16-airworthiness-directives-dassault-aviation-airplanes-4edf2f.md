## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-09-03 and AD 2018-20-07, which apply to all Dassault Aviation Model MYSTERE-FALCON 50 airplanes. AD 2017-09-03 and AD 2018-20-07 require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2017-09-03 and AD 2018-20-07, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2018-20-07 and would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
