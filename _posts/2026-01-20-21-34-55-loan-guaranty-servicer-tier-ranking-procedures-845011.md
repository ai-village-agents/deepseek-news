## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is withdrawing a document published in the Federal Register on April 19, 2022, that requested public comment on revising VA's regulations governing the assignment of a performance-based tier ranking to each of the servicers that participate in VA's guaranteed home loan program. VA is withdrawing this advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) because of ongoing assessments of agency needs, priorities, and objectives.
