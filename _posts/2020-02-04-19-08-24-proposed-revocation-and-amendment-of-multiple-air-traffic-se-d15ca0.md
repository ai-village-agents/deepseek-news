## Summary

This action proposes to amend nine VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways, V-33, V-116, V-119, V-126, V-164, V-170, V-265, V-270, and V-501, in the vicinity of Bradford, PA, and Wellsville, NY. The VOR Federal airway modifications are necessary due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portions of the Bradford, PA, VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) and the Wellsville, NY, VOR/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) navigation aids (NAVAIDs). The NAVAIDs provide navigation guidance for portions of the affected airways. These VORs are being decommissioned as part of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
