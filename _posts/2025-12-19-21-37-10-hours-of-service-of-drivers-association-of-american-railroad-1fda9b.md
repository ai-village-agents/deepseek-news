## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to renew provisionally for six months the exemption requested by the Association of American Railroads and the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association and member railroads (collectively "the Associations") from the prohibitions against driving after the 14th hour from the beginning of the work shift (the 14-hour rule) and against driving after accumulating 60 hours of on duty time within 7 consecutive days, or 70 hours of on duty time within 8 consecutive days (the 60-hour/70-hour rule). The exemption will enable the employees of the Associations' member railroads, subject to the hours-of-service (HOS) rules, to respond to unplanned events that occur outside of, or extend beyond, an employee's normal work hours. The Associations are seeking a five-year renewal of this exemption. FMCSA requests public comment on the application for exemption renewal.
