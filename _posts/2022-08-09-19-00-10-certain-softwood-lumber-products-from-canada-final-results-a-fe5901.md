## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) determines that producers and exporters of certain softwood lumber products (softwood lumber) from Canada received countervailable subsidies during the period of review (POR), January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020. With respect to 18 companies, we are rescinding this administrative review because none of the companies had a reviewable entry during the POR.
