## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2000-20- 15, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A300 and A300-600 series airplanes. AD 2000-20-15 required a high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspection to detect cracking of the rear fittings of fuselage frame FR40 at stringer 27, and repetitive inspections or repair, as applicable. In lieu of accomplishing the repetitive inspections, AD 2000-20-15 provided a modification that would allow the inspection to be deferred for a certain period of time. This AD was prompted by cracking of the rear fittings of fuselage frame FR40 at stringer 27, and a determination that reduced compliance times are necessary. This AD removes airplanes from the applicability, and continues to require the actions in AD 2000-20-15, but at reduced compliance times, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
