## Summary

The Director of the Water Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency--Region 1 (EPA), is providing a notice of availability of draft National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) general permits for discharges from sites engaged in certain dewatering and remediation activities to certain waters in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State of New Hampshire, sites in Connecticut and Rhode Island located on Indian Country lands, and federal facilities in Vermont. The draft NPDES general permits establish electronic Notice of Intent (NOI), Change Notice of Intent (CNOI), and Notice of Termination (NOT) requirements, discharge limitations and requirements, standard and special conditions, and best management practice (BMP) requirements for sites that discharge 1.0 million gallons per day or less. These general permits replace the Dewatering General Permit (DGP) that expired on April 24, 2020, and the Remediation General Permit (RGP) that expires on April 8, 2022. The Draft General Permit is available on EPA Region 1's website. The fact sheet for the draft general permit sets forth principal facts and the significant factual, legal, methodological, and policy questions considered in the development of the draft general permit and is also available at this website.
