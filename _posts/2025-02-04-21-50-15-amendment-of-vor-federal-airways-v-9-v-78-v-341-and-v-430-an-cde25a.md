## Summary

This action amends Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal Airways V-9, V-78, V-341, and V-430, and Canadian Area Navigation (RNAV) Route T-765; and establishes United States (U.S.) RNAV Route T-490. The FAA is taking this action due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Iron Mountain, MI (IMT), VOR/ Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) navigational aid (NAVAID). The Iron Mountain VOR is being decommissioned in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
