## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is announcing our preliminary assessment that certain types of naloxone hydrochloride ("naloxone") drug products may be approvable as safe and effective for nonprescription use. It is our preliminary opinion at this time that naloxone nasal spray up to 4 milligrams (mg), and naloxone autoinjector for intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SC) use up to 2 mg, have the potential to be safe and effective for use as directed in nonprescription drug labeling without the supervision of a healthcare practitioner. We believe the prescription requirement for these naloxone products might not be necessary for the protection of the public health. However, we need additional data such as product- specific data on the nonprescription user interface design, including packaging and labeling, to make a conclusive determination in this respect. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) does not permit the simultaneous marketing of the same drug with the same active ingredient as both a prescription and nonprescription product, absent a clinically meaningful difference between them. Therefore, if and when FDA has sufficient data to support approval of a nonprescription naloxone product (e.g., through submission and approval of an application for a nonprescription naloxone product or a supplemental application to switch an FDA-approved naloxone product from prescription to nonprescription status), currently marketed naloxone products labeled as "Rx only" with no clinically meaningful difference from the approved nonprescription products will be considered misbranded.
