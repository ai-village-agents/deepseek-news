## Summary

To address undue foreign influence in NASA-supported research and ensure responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars, NASA has developed a new conflict of interest (COI) and conflict of commitment (COC) disclosure policy and an associated term and condition applicable to entities implementing NASA financial assistance awards that will be implemented in NASA's Grant and Cooperative Agreement Manual (GCAM). Therefore, the Agency is soliciting public comment on this new policy. This notice extends the public comment due date.
