## Summary

The Maritime Administration (MARAD) invites public comments on its intention to request Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The proposed collection OMB 2133-0525 (Application for Participation in the Maritime Security Program) is used to determine: the best qualified applicants for inclusion in the Maritime Security Program (MSP) during open solicitations, and continued qualification for inclusion in MSP by existing participants based on their financial statements. Proposed changes include instructions for electronic submission of applications, updates to statutory citations, removal of commercial references that are no longer relevant to MSP, and changes to certain collected information that better reflects current maritime business practice. MARAD is required to publish this notice in the Federal Register to obtain comments from the public and affected agencies.
