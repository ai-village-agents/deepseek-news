## Summary

On April 17, 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) promulgated national minimum criteria for existing and new coal combustion residuals (CCR) landfills and existing and new CCR surface impoundments. On August 21, 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the exemption for inactive surface impoundments at inactive facilities and remanded the issue back to EPA to take further action consistent with the opinion in Utility Solid Waste Activities Group, et al. v. EPA. The Agency is proposing to establish regulatory requirements for inactive surface impoundments at inactive facilities (legacy CCR surface impoundments). EPA is also proposing to establish groundwater monitoring, corrective action, closure, and post-closure care requirements for all CCR management units (regardless of how or when that CCR was placed) at regulated CCR facilities. EPA is also proposing several technical corrections to the existing regulations, such as correcting certain citations and harmonizing definitions.
