# Commercial Driver's License: State of Hawaii; Application for Exemption

## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to grant an exemption to the State of Hawaii allowing the State to waive specific portions of the commercial driver's license (CDL) skills test for CDL applicants who take the skills test on the islands of Lanai and Molokai and issue these drivers a restricted CDL. Drivers who receive a restricted CDL under the provisions of this exemption are also exempt from the entry- level driver training (ELDT) regulations. FMCSA concludes that granting this exemption, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this notice, is likely to achieve a level of safety equivalent to or greater than the level that would be achieved absent the exemption. This Federal Register notice supersedes the current two-year exemption granted to the State of Hawaii that is scheduled to expire on February 20, 2026.
