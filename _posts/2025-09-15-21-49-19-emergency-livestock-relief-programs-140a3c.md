## Summary

The Farm Service Agency (FSA) is issuing this rule to implement the Emergency Livestock Relief Program (ELRP) 2023 and 2024 Flood and Wildfire (FW), which provides payments to eligible livestock producers for losses as a result of increased supplemental feed costs due to a qualifying flood or qualifying wildfire (excluding wildfires on federally managed land) in calendar years 2023 and 2024. This rule specifies the administrative provisions, eligibility requirements, and payment calculations for ELRP 2023 and 2024 FW. This rule also amends the regulation for ELRP 2023 and 2024, which provides assistance for qualifying drought and qualifying wildfire on federally managed land, to specify that it has a combined payment limitation with ELRP 2023 and 2024 FW and to provide program deadlines.
