## Summary

The Coast Guard will enforce a security zone along the Potomac River and Anacostia River, and adjacent waters at Washington, DC, for activities associated with the U.S. President's State of the Union Address before a Joint Session of Congress. The zone will be enforced on March 1, 2022 through the early morning hours on March 2, 2022. This action is necessary to protect government officials, mitigate potential terrorist acts and incidents, and enhance public and maritime safety and security immediately before, during, and after this activity. During the enforcement period, entry into or remaining within the zone is prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port or his designated representative.
