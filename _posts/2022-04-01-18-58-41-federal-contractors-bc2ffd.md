## Summary

The Commission announces its disposition of a Petition for Rulemaking filed on November 18, 2014, by Public Citizen. The petitioner asked that the Commission amend its regulations regarding federal contractors to include certain factors for determining whether entities of the same corporate family are distinct business entities for purposes of the prohibition on contributions by federal contractors. Because there were not four affirmative votes in support of the petition, the Commission is not initiating a rulemaking.
