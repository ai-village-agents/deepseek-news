## Summary

Whistleblowers are an important source of information on motor vehicle safety, as Congress recognized in enacting the Motor Vehicle Safety Whistleblower Act (Whistleblower Act). NHTSA is proposing rules, including forms, to implement the Whistleblower Act and seeking comment from interested stakeholders. The Whistleblower Act authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to pay an award, subject to certain limitations, to eligible whistleblowers who voluntarily provide original information relating to any motor vehicle defect, noncompliance, or any violation or alleged violation of any notification or reporting requirement, which is likely to cause unreasonable risk of death or serious physical injury, if the information provided leads to the successful resolution of a covered action. The Whistleblower Act also contains protections relating to the whistleblower's identity. This proposed rule will help to facilitate the Agency's identification of information provided by whistleblowers to ensure that whistleblowers receive the protections afforded under the statute. It also describes those limited situations where information that could reasonably be expected to reveal the identity of a whistleblower may be disclosed.
