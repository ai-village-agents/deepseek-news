## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations, the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is announcing its intention to revise the approved information collection regarding the importation of undenatured inedible product, and samples of imported product for laboratory examination, research, evaluative testing, or trade show exhibition. The approval for this information collection will expire on July 31, 2022. FSIS is reducing the total burden estimate by 14,441 hours because the number of applications for importing meat, poultry or egg products samples destined for laboratory examination, research, evaluative testing, or trade show exhibition has decreased.
