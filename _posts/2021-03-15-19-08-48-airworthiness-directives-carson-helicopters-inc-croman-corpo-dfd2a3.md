# Airworthiness Directives; Carson Helicopters, Inc.; Croman Corporation; Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation; and Siller Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA is revising an earlier proposal for all Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation Model S-61 A, D, E, and V helicopters; Croman Corporation Model SH-3H helicopters, Carson Helicopters, Inc. Model S- 61L helicopters; and Siller Helicopters Model CH-3E and SH-3A helicopters. This action revises the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) by adding camshaft and gear housing part numbers that need to be marked and clarifying the applicability and certain compliance times. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive (AD) to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over that in the NPRM, the FAA is reopening the comment period to allow the public the chance to comment on these changes.
