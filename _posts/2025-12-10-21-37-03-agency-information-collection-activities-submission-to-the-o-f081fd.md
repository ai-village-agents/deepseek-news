## Summary

In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), this notice announces that the Information Collection Request (ICR) summarized below will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected burden. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) proposes to conduct a new information collection, Factors that Influence the Effectiveness of Hazard Anticipation and Attention Maintenance Training, from 168 participants ages 18 and 19 who do not yet have driver's licenses for a research study on novice driver training. This information will be used to test the effectiveness of a hazard anticipation and attention maintenance training program for novice drivers that takes relatively little time to complete and could support future efforts to deliver the training via smartphones. A Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following information collection was published on August 21, 202. NHTSA did not receive any comments on the proposed information collection.
