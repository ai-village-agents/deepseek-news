## Summary

We are advising the public that we have reclassified the region of Nuevo Le[oacute]n, Mexico as Level V for bovine tuberculosis. Previously, the Nuevo Le[oacute]n region was classified as Level IV for bovine tuberculosis. We took this action based on an onsite review of the bovine tuberculosis control and eradication program in Nuevo Le[oacute]n.
