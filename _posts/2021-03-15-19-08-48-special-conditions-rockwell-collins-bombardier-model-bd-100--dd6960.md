## Summary

These special conditions are issued for the Bombardier Model BD-100-1A10 airplane. This airplane, as modified by Rockwell Collins, will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport category airplanes. This design feature is the installation of a system that allows connection to airplane electronic systems and networks, and access from aircraft external to the previously isolated internal airplane electronic assets. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
