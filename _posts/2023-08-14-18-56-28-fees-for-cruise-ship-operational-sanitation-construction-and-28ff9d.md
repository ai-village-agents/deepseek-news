## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), located within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), announces fees for vessel sanitation, construction, and renovation inspections for fiscal year (FY) 2024. These inspections are conducted by HHS/CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program (VSP). VSP helps the cruise industry fulfill its responsibility for developing and implementing comprehensive sanitation programs to minimize the risk for acute gastroenteritis. Every passenger cruise vessel that has a foreign itinerary involving a U.S. port and carries 13 or more passengers is subject to twice-yearly unannounced operational sanitation inspections and, when necessary, reinspection. Cruise vessel design and equipment must meet VSP's sanitary design criteria standards and routine operational inspection requirements. Cruise vessel owners or shipyards that build or renovate cruise vessels can request construction or renovation inspections of new or renovated vessels before their first or next operational inspection.
