## Summary

This regulation establishes exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of various fragrance components listed in Unit II of this document when used as inert ingredients in antimicrobial pesticide formulations applied to food-contact surfaces in public eating places, dairy-processing equipment, and food-processing equipment and utensils when the end-use concentration does not exceed 100 parts per million (ppm). Innovative Reform Group, on behalf of The Clorox Company, submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting establishment of exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of these various fragrance components, when used in accordance with the terms of the exemptions.
