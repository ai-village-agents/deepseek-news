## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Embraer S.A. Model EMB-545 airplanes. This AD was prompted by an error that was detected in the airplane takeoff configuration warning logic. The error prevents the system from sounding an aural alert "No Takeoff Trim" for the flightcrew. This AD requires the installation of a new software version of engine indication and crew alert system (EICAS), as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
