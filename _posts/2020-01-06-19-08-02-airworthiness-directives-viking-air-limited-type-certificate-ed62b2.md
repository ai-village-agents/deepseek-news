## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Viking Air Limited Model CL-215-1A10 and CL-215-6B11 (CL-215T Variant) airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of cracks on the wing lower skin under the drag angle at a certain wing station (WS). This AD requires a one-time inspection of the wing lower skin under the drag angle at a certain WS to determine if a certain repair or modification has been accomplished; repetitive visual inspections of certain fuselage structures; repetitive eddy current inspections of the front spar along a certain WS reference line, the drag angle, and all fastener holes; repetitive structural gap checks of a certain surface; and corrective actions if necessary. This AD also requires replacing certain rivets with certain fasteners, and corrective actions if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
