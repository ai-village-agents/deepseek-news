## Summary

The Commission hereby gives notice of the scheduling of the final phase of countervailing and antidumping duty investigation Nos. 701-TA-685 and 731-TA-1599-1606 (Final) pursuant to the Tariff Act of 1930 ("the Act") to determine whether an industry in the United States is materially injured or threatened with material injury, or the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded, by reason of imports of tin mill products from Canada, China, Germany, the Netherlands, South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, and the United Kingdom, provided for in subheadings 7210.11.00, 7210.12.00, 7210.50.00, 7212.10.00, 7212.50.00, 7225.99.00, and 7226.99.01 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.

In addition, Commerce has made negative preliminary determinations of sales at less-than-fair value in the antidumping duty investigations on tin mill products from the Netherlands, South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.
