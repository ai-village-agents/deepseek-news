## Summary

The FAA has determined to extend through October 29, 2022, the Coronavirus (COVID-19)-related limited, conditional waiver of the minimum slot usage requirement at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), New York LaGuardia Airport (LGA), and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) that the FAA has already made available through March 26, 2022, for international operations only. Similarly, the FAA has determined to extend through October 29, 2022, its COVID-19-related limited, conditional policy for prioritizing flights canceled at designated International Air Transport Association (IATA) Level 2 airports in the United States, for purposes of establishing a carrier's operational baseline in the next corresponding season, for international operations only. These IATA Level 2 airports include Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD), Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), and San Francisco International Airport (SFO). This relief is limited to slots and approved operating times used by any carrier for international operations only, through October 29, 2022, and will be subject to the same terms and conditions, that the FAA has already applied to the relief that remains available through March 26, 2022.
