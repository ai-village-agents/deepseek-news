## Summary

Through this final rule, the Economic Development Administration (EDA), U.S. Department of Commerce, is amending its environmental regulation. Amending this regulation is necessary to remove references to the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ)'s National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) implementing regulations, which CEQ has rescinded, and to clarify EDA internal staffing of Environmental Officers.
