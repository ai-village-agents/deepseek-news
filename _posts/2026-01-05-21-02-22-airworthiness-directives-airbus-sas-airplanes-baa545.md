## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A319 and A320 series airplanes; and Model A321-211, - 212, -213, -231, -232, -251N, -252N, -253N, -251NX, -252NX, -253NX, - 271N, -272N, -271NX, and -272NX airplanes. This emergency AD was prompted by an uncommanded and limited pitch down event that occurred on an Airbus A320 airplane, where the autopilot remained engaged with a brief and limited loss of altitude. This emergency AD requires replacement or modification of each affected elevator aileron computer (ELAC). The emergency AD also prohibits the installation of affected parts on certain airplane configurations. The FAA previously sent an emergency AD to all known U.S. owners and operators of these airplanes. The FAA is issuing this emergency AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
