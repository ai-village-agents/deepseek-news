## Summary

"Executive Order on America's Supply Chains", issued on February 24, 2021, outlines U.S. policy objectives with respect to strengthening the resilience of America's supply chains. The Executive Order directed relevant Secretaries to prepare reports on the supply chains for critical sectors and subsectors within either 100 days or 1 year of the Order. Through this Request for Comment (RFC), the Department of Commerce (Commerce) is requesting input from the public on a draft list of critical goods and materials within four of the supply chains assessed under the Order: public health and biological preparedness, information and communications technology (ICT), energy, and critical minerals. The draft list, defined by 8- and 10-digit tariff lines of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), is set out online at https://www.trade.gov/data-visualization/draft-list-critical-supply- chains. The list of critical goods and materials will serve as a tool to facilitate ongoing targeted analysis of trade data and the evaluation of policies to strengthen these supply chains. This RFC is a part of the government's ongoing work to identify risks, address vulnerabilities, and develop a strategy to promote American supply chains resiliency in accordance with the Order.
