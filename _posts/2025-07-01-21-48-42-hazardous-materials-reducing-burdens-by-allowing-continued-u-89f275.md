## Summary

This NPRM proposes to revise the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) to allow for the continued use of packagings authorized under a manufacturing special permit for duration of the useful life of the package. The current HMR provisions require an otherwise safe and usable package to be discontinued solely because the original special permit has expired or was not renewed.
