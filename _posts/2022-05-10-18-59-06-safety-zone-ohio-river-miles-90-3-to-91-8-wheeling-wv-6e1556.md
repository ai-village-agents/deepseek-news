## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for all navigable waters of the Ohio River from Mile 90.3 to Mile 91.8 from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. The safety zone is needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards created by a floating lantern festival. Entry of vessels or persons into this zone is prohibited unless specifically authorized by Captain of the Port Marine Safety Unit Pittsburgh. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
