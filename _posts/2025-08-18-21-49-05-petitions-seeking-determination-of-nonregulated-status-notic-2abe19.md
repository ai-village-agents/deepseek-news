## Summary

This notice advises the public that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is withdrawing notices of intent to prepare environmental impact statements for two petitions seeking determinations of nonregulated status for organisms developed using genetic engineering. APHIS' decision to withdraw the notices of intent is consistent with APHIS' July 9, 2025 Program Update that as of that date, APHIS will no longer prepare an analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act to accompany its review of petitions seeking a determination of nonregulated status. This document provides public notice of this withdrawal.
