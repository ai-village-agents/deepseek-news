In accordance with the requirements of the PRA, the OCC may not conduct or sponsor, and the respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The OCC is soliciting comment concerning the renewal of its information collection titled, "Community and Economic Development Entities, Community Development Projects, and Other Public Welfare Investments." The OCC also is giving notice that it has sent the collection to OMB for review.
