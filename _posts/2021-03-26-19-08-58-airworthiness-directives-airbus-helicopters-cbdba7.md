## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model AS332L, AS332L1, AS332C, and AS332C1 helicopters. This AD was prompted by the failure of a second stage planet gear installed in the main gearbox (MGB). This AD requires identifying the part number of each second stage planet gear assembly installed in the MGB, replacing an MGB having certain second stage planet gear assembly part numbers with a serviceable MGB, modifying the helicopter by installing a full flow magnetic plug (FFMP), repetitively inspecting the FFMP and the MGB bottom housing and conical housing for metal particles, analyzing any metal particles that are found, and applying corrective actions if necessary, as specified in European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) ADs, which are incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
