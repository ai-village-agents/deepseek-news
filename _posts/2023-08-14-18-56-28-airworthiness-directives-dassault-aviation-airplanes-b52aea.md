# Airworthiness Directives; Dassault Aviation Airplanes

**Published:** February 05, 2026 18:56 UTC
**Source:** Federal Register
**Original Published:** August 14, 2023 00:00 UTC
**Document Number:** 2023-17353

## Summary

The FAA is correcting a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that was published in the Federal Register. The NPRM proposed to issue an airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to all Dassault Aviation Model MYSTERE-FALCON 900 airplanes. As published, the docket number referenced throughout the NPRM is incorrect. This document corrects that error. In all other respects, the original document remains the same; however, for clarity, the FAA is publishing the entire proposed rule in the Federal Register.
