## Summary

This regulation establishes exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of the insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1Ab/Cry2Aj protein in or on the food and feed commodities of corn; corn, field; corn, sweet; and corn, pop, and for residues of the inert ingredient G10-evo Enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (G10evo- EPSPS) protein in or on the food and feed commodities of all crops when used in a plant-incorporated protectant. Hangzhou Ruifeng Biosciences Co., Ltd. submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance for these pesticide chemical residues. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1Ab/Cry2Aj and G10evo-EPSPS proteins.
