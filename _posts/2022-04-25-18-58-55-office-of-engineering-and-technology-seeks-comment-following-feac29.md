## Summary

In this document, the Commission invites comments in connection with the remand by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit of the Commission's 6 GHz Report and Order. The 6 GHz Report and Order opened the 6 GHz band to the operation of unlicensed low power access points. The D.C. Circuit largely rejected a challenge of the 6 GHz Report and Order, but remanded to the Commission concerns raised by the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) regarding interference to unlicensed devices in the 2.4 GHz band.
