## Summary

On March 8, 2021, the Department of Education (Department) published in the Federal Register a notice announcing the reestablishment of a matching program between the Department and the Social Security Administration (SSA) to assist the Department in its obligation to ensure that applicants for student financial assistance under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, satisfy eligibility requirements. This notice corrects language in that notice by removing references to an SSA-restricted data field, date of death, and by more closely mirroring the description of the purpose in the computer matching agreement. All other information in the March 8, 2021 Federal Register notice, remains the same.
