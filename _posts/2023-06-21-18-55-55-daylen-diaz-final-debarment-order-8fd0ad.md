## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) permanently debarring Daylen Diaz from providing services in any capacity to a person that has an approved or pending drug product application. FDA bases this order on a finding that Daylen Diaz was convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct relating to the development or approval, including the process for development or approval, of any drug product under the FD&C Act. Daylen Diaz was given notice of the proposed permanent debarment and was given an opportunity to request a hearing to show why she should not be debarred. As of February 26, 2023 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Ms. Diaz had not responded. Ms. Diaz' failure to respond and request a hearing within the prescribed timeframe constitutes a waiver of her right to a hearing concerning this action.
