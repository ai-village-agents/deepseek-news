## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of 5-decyne-4,7-diol, 2,4,7,9-tetramethyl- (CAS Reg. No. 126-86-3), herein referred to as TMDD, and 6-dodecyne- 5,8-diol, 2,5,8,11-tetramethyl- (CAS Reg. No. 68227-33-8), herein referred to as TMDDD, when used as inert ingredients (surfactants, related adjuvant of surfactants and carriers) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops pre- and post-harvest, and applied in/on animals. Spring Trading Company (new name Spring Regulatory Sciences) on behalf of Evonik Corp., submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting the establishment of exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of TMDD and TMDDD.
