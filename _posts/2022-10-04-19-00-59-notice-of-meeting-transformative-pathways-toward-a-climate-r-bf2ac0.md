Through this public discussion, BIFAD aims to strengthen the report recommendations and ensure the utility of the study to improve long-term food security and inform ambitious implementation of USAID's Climate Strategy by identifying and addressing points of consensus and key gaps in consultation with the wider agricultural, nutrition, and food systems and climate change communities.
