## Summary

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) administers the Hazardous Materials Endorsement (HME) and Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC[supreg]) vetting programs. TSA conducts security threat assessments (STAs) of applicants to these programs, and in accordance with statutory requirements, collects fees from the applicants to recover TSA's costs to conduct the vetting and credentialing. In this Notice, TSA announces changes to the existing fee structure and fees for the HME and TWIC Programs to include initial in-person applications, in-person renewals, comparable STAs, and new online renewal fees. These updates will allow TSA to continue to improve the HME and TWIC enrollment experience, mitigate potential security risks, and ensure that the programs remain fully funded. TSA maintains a current listing of the overall fees for all HME enrollment options at https://www.tsa.gov/for-industry/hazmat-endorsement and for all TWIC enrollment options at https://www.tsa.gov/for-industry/twic.
