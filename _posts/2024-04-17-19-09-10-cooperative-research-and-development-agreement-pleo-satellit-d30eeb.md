## Summary

The Coast Guard is announcing its intent to enter into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with Hughes Network Systems to build a Proof of Concept (POC) to understand the capabilities, benefits, risks, technical limitations, and performance associated with operating a proliferated low earth orbiting (pLEO) satellite system on Coast Guard ships at sea. The pLEO satellite system provides global broadband coverage, to include the extreme northern and southern latitudes, which have traditionally been limited to geostationary satellites. While the Coast Guard is currently considering partnering with Hughes Network Systems, we are soliciting public comment on the possible nature of and participation of other parties in the proposed CRADA. In addition, the Coast Guard also invites other potential non-Federal participants, who have the interest and capability to bring similar contributions to this type of research, to consider submitting proposals for consideration in similar CRADAs.
