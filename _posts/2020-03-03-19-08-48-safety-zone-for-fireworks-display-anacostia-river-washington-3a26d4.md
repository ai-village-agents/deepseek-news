## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for certain navigable waters of the Anacostia River in Washington, DC, on April 11, 2020 (with alternate date of April 12, 2020). This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these waters during a fireworks display. This rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from entering the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Maryland-National Capital Region or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
