## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A320-214, -251N, and -271N airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports that damaged seat rail covers were detected in the forward and aft seat fixation area of some airplanes during initial delivery. This AD requires a one-time detailed inspection of the affected passenger seats and corrective actions if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
