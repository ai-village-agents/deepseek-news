## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-100-1A10 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that some parts of horizontal stabilizer trim actuators (HSTAs) that were meant to be replaced through a required overhaul were not replaced and were instead reinstalled on the HSTAs. This proposed AD would require verification of the HSTA serial number, and, if applicable, replacement of the HSTA. This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
