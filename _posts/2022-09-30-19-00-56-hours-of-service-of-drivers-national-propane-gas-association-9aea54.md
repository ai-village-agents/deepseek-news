## Summary

FMCSA announces that it has received an application from the National Propane Gas Association (NPGA) for an exemption to waive various hours-of-service (HOS) requirements to enable the propane industry to prepare and respond to peak periods of consumer demand among residential, agricultural, and commercial consumers in anticipation of, during, and to recover from emergency conditions. NPGA requests that the exemption apply on a per-driver, per-route basis, and that each company that elects to utilize it must maintain appropriate documentation to demonstrate the presence of peak consumer demand conditions within the scope of the exemption. FMCSA requests public comment on the applicant's request for exemption.
