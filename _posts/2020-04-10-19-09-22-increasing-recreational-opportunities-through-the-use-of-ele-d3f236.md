# Increasing Recreational Opportunities Through the Use of Electric Bikes

## Summary

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) proposes to amend its off- road vehicle regulations to add a definition for electric bikes (e- bikes) and, where certain criteria are met and an authorized officer expressly determines through a formal decision that e-bikes should be treated the same as non-motorized bicycles, expressly exempt those e- bikes from the definition of off-road vehicles. This proposed change would facilitate increased recreational opportunities for all Americans, especially those with physical limitations, and would encourage the enjoyment of lands and waters managed by the BLM.
