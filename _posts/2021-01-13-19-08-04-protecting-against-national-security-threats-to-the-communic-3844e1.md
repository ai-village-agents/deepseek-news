## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) establishes rules to publish a list of covered communications equipment and services determined to be a risk to national security. Eligible telecommunications carriers (ETCs) that receive universal service funding to provide service in remote areas of the country must remove such equipment or services from their networks and properly dispose of it. This document also establishes the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Reimbursement Program, which will provide funds to smaller providers of advanced communications services for the removal and replacement of covered communications equipment and services, conditioned on the appropriation of funds by Congress. Lastly, all providers of advanced communications services must report whether their networks include any covered communications equipment or services acquired after August 14, 2018.
