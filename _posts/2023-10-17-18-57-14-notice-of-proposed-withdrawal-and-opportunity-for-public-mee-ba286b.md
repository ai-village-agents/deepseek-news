## Summary

On behalf of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and subject to valid existing rights, the Secretary of the Interior proposes to withdraw 311.09 acres of public land from location and entry under the United States mining laws, but not from leasing under the mineral and geothermal leasing laws or disposal under the Mineral Materials Act of 1947, for 50 years to protect the historic and recreational values associated with the Silver City National Historic Site, Idaho. Publication of this notice segregates the lands for up to two years from location and entry under the United States mining laws, subject to valid existing rights, but not from leasing under the mineral and geothermal leasing laws or disposal under the Mineral Materials Act of 1947, while the application is being processed. This notice initiates a 90-day public comment period and announces the opportunity to request a public meeting on the proposed withdrawal.
