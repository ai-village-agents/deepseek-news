## Summary

NMFS increases the 2022 Atlantic herring annual catch limit and Area 1A sub-annual catch limit by 1,000 metric tons (mt) for the remainder of 2022. This action is required by the herring regulations when, based on data through October 1, NMFS determines that the New Brunswick weir fishery landed less than 3,012 mt of herring. This notification informs the public of these catch limit changes.
