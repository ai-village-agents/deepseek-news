## Summary

The Superior National Forest (SNF) published a notice of intent (NOI) to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on April 15, 2020 for the Lutsen Mountains Ski Area Expansion Project. Lutsen Mountain Corporation (LMC) has submitted a proposal to the SNF to implement select projects at Lutsen Mountains Resort (Lutsen Mountains). All projects are identified within the Lutsen Mountains 2016 Master Development Plan (MDP). The original scoping period was identified to conclude May 15, 2020. The scoping period will be extended to conclude May 28, 2020. The original NOI also indicated that one public open house meeting would be held; however, in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States, and the Center for Disease Control's recommendation for social distancing and avoiding large public gatherings, a public meeting will not be scheduled during the scoping period.
