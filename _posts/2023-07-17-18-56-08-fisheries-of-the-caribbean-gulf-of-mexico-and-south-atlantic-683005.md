## Summary

NMFS proposes regulations to implement management measures described in Framework Amendment 12 under the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Coastal Migratory Pelagic (CMP) Resources of the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Region (CMP FMP), as prepared and submitted by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Gulf Council). This proposed rule and Framework Amendment 12 would modify the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) migratory group of king mackerel (Gulf king mackerel) gillnet component commercial fishing season. The purpose of this proposed rule and Framework Amendment 12 is to allow the Gulf king mackerel gillnet component of the CMP fishery to fish without interruption from the season start date until NMFS determines that the gillnet quota has been met.
