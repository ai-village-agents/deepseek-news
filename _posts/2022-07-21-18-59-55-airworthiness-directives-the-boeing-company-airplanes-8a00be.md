## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that during a C-check, corrosion was found in the vertical fin tension bolt hole located in the aluminum crown frames at a certain section. This AD requires inspecting certain vertical fin tension bolt holes; reviewing the bolt sealant application installation procedure in the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable; checking maintenance records to determine the replacement status of vertical fin tension bolts; and doing applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
