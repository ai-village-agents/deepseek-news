## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Airbus Helicopters Model AS332C, AS332C1, AS332L, AS332L1, AS332L2, and SA330J helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of three newly supplied main rotor swashplate bushing retaining plates with oversized internal diameters. This AD requires accomplishing a one-time inspection to measure the internal diameter of affected bushing retaining plates and depending on the results, accomplishing an additional inspection, replacing non-conforming bushing retaining plates, or accomplishing additional corrective action, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA previously sent this AD as an emergency AD to all known U.S. owners and operators of these helicopters. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
