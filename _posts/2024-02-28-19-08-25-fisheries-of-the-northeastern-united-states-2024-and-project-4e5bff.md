## Summary

NMFS proposes 2024 specifications and projected 2025 specifications for Atlantic mackerel. The implementing regulations for the Mackerel, Squid, and Butterfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) require us to publish specifications for the upcoming fishing year for each of these species and to provide an opportunity for public comment. The proposed specifications are intended to establish allowable harvest levels that will prevent overfishing, consistent with the most recent scientific information.
