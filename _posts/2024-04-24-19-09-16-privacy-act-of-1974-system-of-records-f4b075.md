## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the DoD is modifying and reissuing a current system of records titled, "DCAA Management Information System (DMIS), RDCAA 590.8." This system of records was originally established by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) to collect and maintain records on audit requirements, programs, and performance and to provide timekeepers with access to time and attendance records. This system of records notice (SORN) is being updated to change the SORN title from "DCAA Management Information System (DMIS)" to "DCAA Portfolio Management System Records." The DoD is also modifying various other sections within the SORN to improve clarity or update information that has changed.
