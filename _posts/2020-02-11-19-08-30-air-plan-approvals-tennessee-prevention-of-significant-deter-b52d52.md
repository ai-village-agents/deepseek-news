## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to conditionally approve portions of the Tennessee infrastructure State Implementation Plan (SIP) submission for the 2015 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) provided to EPA on September 13, 2018. Whenever EPA promulgates a new or revised NAAQS, the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) requires that states adopt and submit a SIP for the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of each such NAAQS, commonly referred to as an "infrastructure SIP." Specifically, EPA is proposing to conditionally approve the portions of the Tennessee infrastructure SIP submission related to the prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) infrastructure elements for the 2015 8-hour ozone NAAQS.
