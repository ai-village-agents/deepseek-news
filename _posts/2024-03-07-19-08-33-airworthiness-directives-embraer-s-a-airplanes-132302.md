## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Embraer S.A. Model EMB-545 and EMB-550 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by occurrences of premature cracks in the outer layer of certain flight deck side windows caused by interference due to manufacturing tolerances. This proposed AD would require initial and repetitive inspections of the flight deck side windows and applicable corrective actions, and would prohibit the installation of affected flight deck side windows, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
