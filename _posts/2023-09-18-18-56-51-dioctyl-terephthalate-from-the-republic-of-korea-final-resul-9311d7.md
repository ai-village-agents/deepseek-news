## Summary

On July 14, 2023, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) published the notice of initiation and preliminary results of the changed circumstances review (CCR) of the antidumping duty (AD) order on dioctyl terephthalate (DOTP) from the Republic of Korea (Korea). Commerce preliminarily determined that Aekyung Chemical Co., Ltd. (AKC) is the successor-in-interest to Aekyung Petrochemical Co., Ltd. (AKP) and, as a result, should be accorded the same AD cash deposit rate as AKP with respect to subject merchandise. For these final results, Commerce continues to find that AKC is the successor-in-interest to AKP and is entitled to the same cash deposit rate as AKP under the AD order on DOTP from Korea.
