# Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA is revising an earlier proposal for all The Boeing Company Model 737-100, -200, -200C, -300, -400, and -500 series airplanes. This action revises the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) by reducing the compliance time for certain airplanes. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive (AD) to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over that in the NPRM, the FAA is reopening the comment period to allow the public the chance to comment on these changes.
