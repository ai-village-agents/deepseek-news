## Summary

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is proposing to amend its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) regulations. The proposal would amend the OCC's FOIA regulations to provide for expedited processing of FOIA requests and establish procedures for requestors to appeal denials of expedited processing and fee waiver requests. The proposal also would remove the competitive harm standard for information provided to the government on an involuntary basis and make a conforming amendment to the OCC's FOIA regulations to be consistent with FOIA.
