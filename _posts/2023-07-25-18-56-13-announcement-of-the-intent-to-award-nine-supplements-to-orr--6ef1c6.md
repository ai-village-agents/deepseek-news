## Summary

ACF, ORR, Division of Refugee Health (DRH) announces the intent to award supplements in the aggregate amount of up to $466,563 to nine grant recipients under Notice of Funding Opportunity: Direct Services for Survivors of Torture, HHS-2022-ACF-ORR-ZT-0051. The purpose of the awards is to ensure that the 222 Nicaraguan Humanitarian Parolees (NHP) who were brought to the United States will have access to holistic care and services. This supplement will enable the identified grant recipients in California, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Texas, and Virginia to provide access to medical, mental health, social, and legal services to NHP within their geographic service areas, and coordinate with The Center for Victims of Torture in Minnesota and other providers to serve NHP outside their service areas. The goal of these services is to help the NHP improve their health, find employment and stable housing, and regularize their immigration status.
