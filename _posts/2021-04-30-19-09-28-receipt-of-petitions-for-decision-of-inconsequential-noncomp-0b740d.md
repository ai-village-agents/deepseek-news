Due to Ricon's determination, Navistar, Inc. on behalf of IC Bus, LLC (Navistar), and Daimler Trucks North America (DTNA), who installed the S-Series and K-Series Titanium wheelchair lifts in their buses, determined that certain model year (MY) 2015-2019 IC and Thomas Built buses do not comply with FMVSS No. 404, Platform Lift Installation in Motor Vehicles. Ricon, Navistar, and DTNA, collectively referred to as the "the petitioners," filed the appropriate noncompliance reports and petitioned NHTSA for a decision that the subject noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. This document announces receipt of the petitioners' petitions.
