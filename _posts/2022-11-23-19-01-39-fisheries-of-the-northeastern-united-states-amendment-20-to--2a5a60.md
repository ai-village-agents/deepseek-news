## Summary

This final rule announces approval of, and implements management measures contained in, Amendment 20 to the Atlantic Surfclam and Ocean Quahog Fishery Management Plan. The Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council developed these measures to limit the amount of surfclam or ocean quahog individual transferable quota share or annual allocation in the form of cage tags that an individual or their family members are permitted to hold. These changes are intended to ensure the management plan is consistent with requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, and to improve the management of these fisheries.
