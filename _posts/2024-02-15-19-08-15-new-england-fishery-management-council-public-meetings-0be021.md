## Summary

The New England Fishery Management Council (Council) is conducting six scoping meetings to solicit comments regarding the rang of alternatives to consider in Amendment 10 (A10) to the Atlantic Herring Fishery Management Plan to consider actions affecting New England fisheries in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The Council is proposing to take action through A10 to address spatial and temporal allocation and management of Atlantic herring at the management unit level to minimize user conflicts, contribute to optimum yield and support rebuilding of the resource. The Council is also proposing to take action to enhance river herring (alewife and blueback herring) and shad (American shad and hickory shad) avoidance and other catch reduction measures to better support ongoing coastwide restoration efforts for those species. The Council is scheduling the scoping meetings in accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act and the National Environmental Policy Act. A summary of public comments received will be provided to the Council for formal consideration and action, if appropriate.
