## Summary

This rule temporarily changes the substandard and maturity dockage requirements for raisins covered under the Federal marketing order for raisins produced from grapes grown in California (Order). For the 2023-2024 crop year, the minimum requirements for substandard and maturity dockage in the marketing order's handling regulations will be relaxed to accommodate raisins adversely impacted by severe weather conditions.
