## Summary

This action amends the Class E surface area, Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface and creates Class E airspace as an extension to the Class E surface area at Battle Mountain Airport, Battle Mountain, NV. After establishment of a new area navigation (RNAV) procedure and review of the airspace, the FAA found it necessary to amend the existing airspace and establish new controlled airspace for the safety and management of Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operations at this airport. This action also removes a reference to the Battle Mountain VORTAC from the legal description for the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet.
