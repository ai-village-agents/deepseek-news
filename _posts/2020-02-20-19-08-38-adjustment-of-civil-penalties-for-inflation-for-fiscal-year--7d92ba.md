## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is correcting a final rule that appeared in the Federal Register on January 15, 2020, that amended its regulations to adjust the maximum civil monetary penalties it can assess under statutes enforced by the agency. These changes are mandated by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, as amended by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015. This document corrects the final rule to provide the correct maximum civil monetary penalty, per day, for a violation of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or any regulation or order issued under the Atomic Energy Act.
