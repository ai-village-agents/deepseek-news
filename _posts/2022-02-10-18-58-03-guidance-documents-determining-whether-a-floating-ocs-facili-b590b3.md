## Summary

The Coast Guard is issuing policies that will guide Officers In Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMIs) in determining if a Floating Outer Continental Shelf Facility (FOF) is a vessel or a non-vessel. As a result of these changes non-vessel FOFs will no longer receive a Certificate of Inspection (CG Form 841), and personnel serving on these FOFs will no longer be required to hold Merchant Mariner Credentials. In association with these changes, the Coast Guard is canceling USCG District 8 Policy Letter 08-2001, Licensing Requirements for Personnel on Non-Self Propelled Floating OCS Facilities.
