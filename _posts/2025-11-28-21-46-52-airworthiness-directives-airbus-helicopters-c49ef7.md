# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model EC120B helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of cyclic flight control restrictions due to the incorrect positioning of the bonding braid on the socket of the pilot cyclic stick, which limited full movement of the pilot cyclic stick during flight. This proposed AD would require a one-time inspection of the position of the bonding braid on the socket of the pilot cyclic stick and, depending on the results, correcting the positioning of the bonding braid and installing a binding clamp. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
