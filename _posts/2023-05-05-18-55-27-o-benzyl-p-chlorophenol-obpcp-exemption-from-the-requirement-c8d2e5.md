## Summary

EPA is proposing to exempt residues of the antimicrobial pesticide ingredients Ortho-benzyl-para-chlorophenol, Potassium 2- benzyl-4-chlorophenate, and Sodium 2-benzyl-4-chlorophenate from the requirement of a tolerance when used on or applied to food contact surfaces in public eating places, dairy processing equipment, and food processing equipment and utensils. This rulemaking is proposed on the Agency's own initiative under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), in order to implement the tolerance actions EPA identified during its review of these chemicals as part of the Agency's registration review program under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).
