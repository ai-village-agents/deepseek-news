## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) permanently debarring Charles Jeffrey Edwards from providing services in any capacity to a person that has an approved or pending drug product application. FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Edwards was convicted, as defined in the FD&C Act, of two felony counts under federal law for conduct that relates to the regulation of a drug product under the FD&C Act. Mr. Edwards was given notice of the proposed permanent debarment and was given an opportunity to request a hearing within the timeframe prescribed by regulation to show why he should not be debarred. As of November 15, 2019 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Mr. Edwards had not responded. Mr. Edwards's failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this action.
