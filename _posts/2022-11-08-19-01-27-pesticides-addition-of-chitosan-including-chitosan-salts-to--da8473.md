## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is adding a substance commonly referred to as chitosan (also known by its chemical name: poly-D-glucosamine) (CAS No. 9012-76-4) to the list of active ingredients eligible for use in minimum risk pesticide products exempt from registration and other requirements of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). In doing so, EPA is specifying that the listing also includes those chitosan salts that can be formed when chitosan is mixed with the acids that are listed as active or inert ingredients eligible for use in minimum risk pesticide products.
