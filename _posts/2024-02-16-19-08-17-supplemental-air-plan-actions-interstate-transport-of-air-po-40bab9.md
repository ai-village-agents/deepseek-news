## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to partially disapprove and partially approve State Implementation Plan (SIP) submissions from Arizona, Iowa, Kansas, New Mexico, and Tennessee regarding interstate transport for the 2015 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). This action also proposes a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for Arizona, Iowa, Kansas, New Mexico, and Tennessee to address these States' obligations to eliminate significant contribution to nonattainment, or interference with maintenance, of the 2015 ozone NAAQS in other states. The FIP would require fossil fuel-fired power plants in the five states to participate in an allowance-based ozone season nitrogen oxides emissions trading program beginning in 2025. The Agency is also proposing to establish nitrogen oxides emissions limitations applicable to certain other industrial stationary sources in Arizona with a compliance year no earlier than 2027. Finally, this action also includes proposed technical corrections to the regulatory text previously promulgated to establish comparable FIP requirements for emissions sources in other states.
