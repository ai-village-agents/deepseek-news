## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled "Clinical Trial Considerations to Support Accelerated Approval of Oncology Therapeutics." The purpose of this guidance is to provide recommendations to sponsors of anti-cancer drugs or biological products on considerations for designing trials intended to support accelerated approval. The accelerated approval pathway is commonly used for approval of oncology drugs due to the serious and life-threatening nature of cancer. Although single-arm trials have been commonly used to support accelerated approval, a randomized controlled trial is the preferred approach as it provides a more robust efficacy and safety assessment and allows for direct comparisons to an available therapy. This guidance describes considerations for designing, conducting, and analyzing data for trials intended to support accelerated approvals of oncology therapeutics.
