## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports the overwing emergency exit door (OWEED) escape line may be incorrectly routed. This proposed AD would require inspecting the OWEED escape line and correcting the routing if required, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
