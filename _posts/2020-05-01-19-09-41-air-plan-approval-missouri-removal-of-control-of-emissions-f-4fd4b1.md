## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Missouri on December 3, 2018, and supplemented by letter on May 22, 2019. Missouri requests that the EPA remove a rule related to control of emissions from the application of automotive underbody deadeners in the Kansas City, Missouri area from its SIP. This removal does not have an adverse effect on air quality. The EPA's approval of this rule revision is in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
