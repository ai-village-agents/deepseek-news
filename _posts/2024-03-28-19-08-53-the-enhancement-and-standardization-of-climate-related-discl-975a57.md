## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") is adopting amendments to its rules under the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") that will require registrants to provide certain climate-related information in their registration statements and annual reports. The final rules will require information about a registrant's climate- related risks that have materially impacted, or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on, its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. In addition, under the final rules, certain disclosures related to severe weather events and other natural conditions will be required in a registrant's audited financial statements.
