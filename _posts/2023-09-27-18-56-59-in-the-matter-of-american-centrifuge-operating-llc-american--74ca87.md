## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing a Confirmatory Order (Order) to American Centrifuge Operating, LLC (ACO, the licensee), as a result of a successful alternative dispute resolution mediation session completed on June 27, 2023. The commitments outlined in the Order were made as part of a settlement agreement concerning apparent violations by ACO for failing to meet NRC regulatory requirements related to protection of classified information. Details regarding the apparent violations contain security-related information and are therefore documented in a non- public version of the Order. The Order is effective upon issuance.
