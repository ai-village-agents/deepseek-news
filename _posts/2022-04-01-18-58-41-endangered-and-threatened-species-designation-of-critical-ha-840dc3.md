## Summary

We, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), issue this final rule to designate critical habitat for the Arctic subspecies of the ringed seal (Pusa hispida hispida) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The critical habitat designation comprises an area of marine habitat in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas. Based on consideration of national security impacts, we have excluded an area north of the Beaufort Sea shelf from the designation.
