## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain General Electric Company (GE) Model GEnx-1B64, GEnx-1B64/P1, GEnx-1B64/P2, GEnx-1B67, GEnx-1B67/P1, GEnx-1B67/P2, GEnx-1B70, GEnx- 1B70/75/P1, GEnx-1B70/75/P2, GEnx-1B70/P1, GEnx-1B70/P2, GEnx-1B70C/P1, GEnx-1B70C/P2, GEnx-1B74/75/P1, GEnx-1B74/75/P2, GEnx-1B76/P2, GEnx- 1B76A/P2, GEnx-2B67, GEnx-2B67B, and GEnx-2B67/P engines. This AD was prompted by a manufacturer evaluation that determined a lower life limit may be necessary for certain stages 6-10 compressor rotor spools than allowed by the engine shop manual (ESM). This AD requires a one- time inspection of the stages 6-10 spools for previously accomplished blend repairs, a one-time inspection of the blend repairs on the stages 6-10 spools for compliance with the updated allowable limits, and replacement if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
