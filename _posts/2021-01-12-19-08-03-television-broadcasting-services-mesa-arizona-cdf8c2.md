## Summary

The Media Bureau, Video Division (Bureau) has before it a notice of proposed rulemaking issued in response to a petition for rulemaking filed by Multimedia Holdings Corporation (Multimedia), licensee of KPNX, channel 12 (NBC), Mesa, Arizona, requesting the substitution of channel 18 for channel 12 at Mesa in the DTV Table of Allotments. The Bureau had instituted a freeze on the acceptance of rulemaking petitions by full power television stations requesting channel substitutions in May 2011 and waived the freeze to consider Multimedia's proposal to substitute channel 18 at Mesa. TEGNA, Inc., filed comments in support of the petition reaffirming its commitment to applying for channel 18. The Bureau believes the public interest would be served by the substitution and will permit the station to better serve its viewers, who have experienced reception problems with VHF channel 12.
