## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of benzyl alcohol (CAS Reg. No. 100-51-6) when used as an inert ingredient (adjuvant) in pesticide formulations applied to crops and raw agricultural commodities pre- and post- harvest, limited to no more than 60% by weight in the pesticide formulation. Landis International, Inc., on behalf of CJB Applied Technologies, LLC, submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of benzyl alcohol when used in accordance with the terms of the exemption.
