## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FMCSA announces its plan to submit the Information Collection Request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval. This notice invites comments on a proposed information collection titled "Study of Warning Devices for Stopped Commercial Motor Vehicles." It is an experimental study that requires data collection for evaluating whether warning devices meaningfully influence crash-relevant aspects of human performance in the presence of a parked or disabled commercial motor vehicle (PDCMV), and if so, how and to what extent. These data collection efforts are expected to require the participation of 256 drivers. A total of 9 comments were provided in response to the 60-day Federal Register notice (91 FR 1591). The total burden hours reported in the 60-day FR published on January 8, 2025, has now been decreased by 128 hours after FMCSA inadvertently included but has now removed the 128 hours from the burden estimate. The 128 hours is the time estimated for respondents to travel to and from the location where the collection of information will occur.
