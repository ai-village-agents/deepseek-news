## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FMCSA announces its plan to submit the Information Collection Request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review and approval and invites public comment. FMCSA requests approval to renew the ICR titled, "Application for Certificate of Registration for Foreign Motor Carriers and Foreign Motor Private Carriers," OMB Control No. 2126-0019. Foreign (Mexico-based) for-hire and private motor carriers are required to file an application Form OP-2 if they wish to register to transport property within municipalities in the United States on the U.S.-Mexico international border or within the commercial zones of such municipalities. The Certificate of Registration only permits the holder to operate in the United States within these areas. A holder of a Certificate of Registration who operates a vehicle beyond these areas is subject to applicable penalties and out-of-service orders.
