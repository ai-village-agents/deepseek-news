## Summary

The Department of the Interior (the Department or DOI), acting through the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), is amending the Department's regulations to rescind a section that provides for publishing a renewable energy leasing schedule every 2 years. This section is not necessary because it is not mandated by the statute for renewable energy regulations.
