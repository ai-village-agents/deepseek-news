## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-21-15 for certain Diamond Aircraft Industries GmbH (DAI) Model DA 42, DA 42 NG, and DA 42 M-NG airplanes. AD 2022-21-15 required replacing the rudder T-yoke axle with an improved rudder T-yoke axle. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-21-15, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) superseded its mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) to correct an unsafe condition on these products. This AD requires, for certain airplanes, inspecting the rudder steering bracket edge distance and depending on the inspection results, inspecting the T-yoke bolt hole for wear and play, and corrective action if necessary. For certain airplanes this AD requires replacing the rudder T-yoke bolt (axle) with a serviceable part, installing a new self-locking nut, and applying torque seal marks on the rudder T-yoke bolt head and self-locking nut. For all airplanes this AD requires repetitively inspecting the torque seal marks on the rudder T-yoke bolt head for proper alignment and the self-locking nut for proper installation and corrective action if necessary. This AD also prohibits the installation of affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
