## Summary

NMFS received a request from the U.S. Navy (Navy) for the renewal of their currently active incidental harassment authorization (IHA) to take marine mammals incidental to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard Dry Dock 1 modification and expansion in Kittery, Maine. These activities are nearly identical to those covered in the current authorization. The project has been delayed and a small portion of the activities covered in the initial IHA have not been completed. The Navy also proposes to drive an additional number of piles for which the installation methods are identical and pile types are nearly identical to those covered in the initial IHA. Pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act, NMFS requested comments on both the proposed IHA and the potential for renewing the initial authorization if certain requirements were satisfied. The renewal requirements have been satisfied, and NMFS is now providing an additional 15-day comment period to allow for any additional comments on the proposed renewal not previously provided during the initial 30-day comment period.
