## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'' or ``Commission'') is announcing an opportunity for public comment on the proposed renewal of a collection of certain information by the agency. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act (``PRA''), Federal agencies are required to publish notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of information, including a proposed extension of an existing collection of information, and to allow 60 days for public comment. This notice solicits comments on the information collections included in certain Commission's regulations, requiring swap dealers (``SDs'') and major swap participants (``MSPs'') to follow specified procedures and provide specified disclosures in their dealings with counterparties, to adopt and implement conflicts of interest procedures and disclosures, and to maintain specified records related to those requirements.
