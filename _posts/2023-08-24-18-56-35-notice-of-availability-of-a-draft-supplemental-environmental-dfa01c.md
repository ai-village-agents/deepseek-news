## Summary

We are advising the public that a draft supplemental environmental assessment (EA) and draft finding of no significant impact (FONSI) have been prepared by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service relative to our emergency response activities to highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks in commercial and backyard poultry operations located in the four migratory bird flyways in the United States. This draft EA supplements the initial EA and FONSI we published in September 2022, which evaluated the environmental impacts associated with the first seven States where highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks occurred. We are making this draft supplemental EA and draft FONSI simultaneously available to the public for review and comment.
