## Summary

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) announces publication of the updated significant changes that have already been made to the NIH Grants Policy Statement (GPS) in fiscal year 2023 that will be reflected in the GPS for fiscal year 2024. The NIH GPS provides both up-to-date policy guidance that serves as NIH standard terms and conditions of award for all NIH grants and cooperative agreements, and extensive guidance to those who are interested in pursuing NIH grants. This update incorporates significant changes for FY 2024, such as new and modified requirements, clarifies certain policies, and implements changes in statutes, regulations, and policies that have been implemented through appropriate legal and/or policy processes (e.g., Federal Register Notices, where appropriate) since the previous version of the NIHGPS dated December 2022.
