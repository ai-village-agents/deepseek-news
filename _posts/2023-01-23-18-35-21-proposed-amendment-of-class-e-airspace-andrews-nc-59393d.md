## Summary

This action proposes to amend Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface for Western Carolina Regional Airport, Andrews, NC, as a new Area Navigation Global Positioning System (RNAV GPS) approach has been designed for this airport. This action would also update the airport's name and geographic coordinates. Murphy Medical Center would also be removed from the descriptor, as all instrument approaches into the hospital have been canceled. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.
