## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD- 500-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report the engine fire extinguishing control and indication system did not illuminate correctly. This proposed AD would require installing a software update to the integrated cockpit control panel (ICCP) remote data concentrator (RDC), as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
