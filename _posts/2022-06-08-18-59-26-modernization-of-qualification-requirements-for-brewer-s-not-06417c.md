## Summary

In this notice of proposed rulemaking, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes deregulatory amendments to its regulations to modernize and streamline the qualification requirements for Brewer's Notices. The proposed amendments also relax requirements associated with reporting certain changes to brewery businesses and other notification requirements. The proposed amendments are a result of TTB's evaluation of its qualification requirements and consideration of relevant public comments submitted to the Treasury Department in response to its request for recommendations concerning regulations that can be eliminated, modified, or streamlined to reduce burdens.
