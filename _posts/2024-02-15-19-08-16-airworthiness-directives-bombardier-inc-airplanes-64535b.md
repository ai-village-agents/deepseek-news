## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-100-1A10 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of a steering control unit (SCU) filter plate connector that does not meet the certification requirements for exposure of electronic components to high intensity radiated field environments, which could result in malfunction of the nose wheel steering (NWS) system. This AD requires determining if the SCU is an affected SCU, replacing all affected SCUs, and rigging and testing the NWS control. This AD also prohibits installing an affected SCU on any airplane. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
