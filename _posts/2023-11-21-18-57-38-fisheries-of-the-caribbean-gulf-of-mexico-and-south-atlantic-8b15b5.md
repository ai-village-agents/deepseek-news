## Summary

NMFS implements an accountability measure (AM) for commercial greater amberjack in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) exclusive economic zone (EEZ) reef fish fishery for the 2024 fishing year through this temporary rule. NMFS has determined that Gulf greater amberjack landings in 2023 exceeded the commercial annual catch limit (ACL). Therefore, NMFS reduces both the commercial ACL and commercial annual catch target (ACT) for greater amberjack in the Gulf EEZ during the 2024 fishing year. This commercial ACL and ACT reduction is necessary to protect the Gulf greater amberjack resource.
