## Summary

The Department of Energy, Office of Legacy Management (DOE-LM) has filed an application with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) requesting that the Secretary of the Interior exercise authority under Title II of the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 (UMTRCA) to permanently withdraw and transfer administrative jurisdiction over 70 acres of public lands at the Durita Mill Tailings Site in Colorado to DOE-LM. The public land and interests in the land would be withdrawn from operation of the general land laws, including the United States mining laws, the mineral and geothermal leasing laws, and the mineral materials disposal laws, subject to valid existing rights, and would be transferred to DOE-LM for long term maintenance and monitoring under a Nuclear Regulatory Commission license as part of the Durita Mill Tailings Site. This notice announces a 30-day opportunity for the public to comment on the DOE-LM application and request a public meeting.
