## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a safety zone for reoccurring firework displays on the Mobile River in the vicinity of the Arthur R. Outlaw Convention Center in Mobile, AL. The safety zone would be enforced only during the firework displays. Establishment of this safety zone is necessary to protect waterway users and vessels from potential hazards associated with these firework displays. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit entry into the safety zone during the firework displays unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Mobile (COTP), or a COTP designated representative.
