## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving three State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision requests, submitted by Indiana, Michigan, and Minnesota. All three States submitted the SIP revision requests in 2016 in response to a finding of substantial inadequacy and a SIP call published on June 12, 2015, for specific provisions in each State's SIP related to excess emissions during startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) events. EPA is determining that each submission corrects the State's respective SIP deficiencies as identified in the June 12, 2015, SIP call. EPA proposed to approve this action on May 5, 2022, and received no adverse comments.
