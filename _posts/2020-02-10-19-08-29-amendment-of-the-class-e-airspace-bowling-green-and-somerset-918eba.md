## Summary

This action amends the Class E airspace area designated as a surface area and the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Bowling Green-Warren County Regional Airport, Bowling Green, KY, and Lake Cumberland Regional Airport, Somerset, KY. This action is due to an airspace review caused by the decommissioning of the Bowling Green VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) navigation aid, which provided navigation information for the instrument procedures at these airports, as part of the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program. The name and geographic coordinates of Lake Cumberland Regional Airport are also being updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
