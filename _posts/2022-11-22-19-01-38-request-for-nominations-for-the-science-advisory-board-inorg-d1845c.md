## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Science Advisory Board (SAB) Staff Office requests public nominations of scientific experts to form a Panel to review the draft EPA Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) Toxicological Review of Inorganic Arsenic. Based on the publicly available systematic review protocol, EPA's draft assessment includes a summary of the chemical properties and pharmacokinetics; hazard identification analysis for diseases of the circulatory system, pregnancy and birth outcomes, diabetes, and neurodevelopmental effects; and dose-response analysis characterizing the quantitative relationship for the noncancer outcomes listed above as well as for bladder cancer and lung cancer. These quantitative relationships are then used to derive cancer and non-cancer toxicity values (e.g., oral slope factor, reference dose). The SAB Inorganic Arsenic Review Panel will consider whether the conclusions found in the EPA's draft assessment are clearly presented and scientifically supported.
