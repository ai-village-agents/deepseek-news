## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Siam Hiller Holdings, Inc. (Siam Hiller), Model UH-12E (Army OH-23G and H-23F) and UH-12E-L helicopters. This AD was prompted by reports of cracks found in a main rotor (M/R) transmission drive shaft (drive shaft). This AD requires inspecting certain M/R drive shafts for a crack, prohibits installing certain M/R drive shafts unless the inspection is done, and prohibits using certain paint strippers. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
