## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Georgia, through the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (GA EPD) on September 1, 2020. Specifically, EPA is proposing to approve updates to the incorporation by reference of federal prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) new source review (NSR) regulations in the Georgia SIP. Based on the proposal to approve this SIP revision, EPA is also proposing to convert the previous conditional approval regarding Georgia's infrastructure SIP's PSD elements for the 2015 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) to a full approval. EPA is proposing to approve these changes pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act).
