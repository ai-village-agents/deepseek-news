## Summary

In August 2012, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) published a consumer product safety standard for play yards pursuant to section 104 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA). The Commission's mandatory standard incorporates by reference ASTM F406, Standard Consumer Safety Specification for Non-Full-Size Baby Cribs/Play Yards, with modifications that exclude sections of ASTM F406 that apply to non- full-size (NFS) cribs exclusively. The CPSIA sets forth a process for updating mandatory standards for durable infant or toddler products that are based on a voluntary standard, when a voluntary standards organization revises the standard. In September 2024, ASTM published a revised voluntary standard, and this direct final rule updates the mandatory standard for play yards to incorporate by reference the 2024 version of ASTM F406.
