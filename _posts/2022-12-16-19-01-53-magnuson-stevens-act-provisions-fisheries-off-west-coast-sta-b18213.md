## Summary

This final rule establishes the 2023-24 harvest specifications for groundfish caught in the U.S. exclusive economic zone seaward of Washington, Oregon, and California, consistent with the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act and the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan. This final rule also revises management measures intended to keep the total annual catch of each groundfish stock or stock complex within the annual catch limits. These measures are intended to help prevent overfishing, rebuild overfished stocks, achieve optimum yield, and ensure management measures are based on the best scientific information available. This final rule also makes minor corrections to the regulations. This action also implements portions of Amendment 30 to the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan, which specifies a shortbelly rockfish catch threshold to initiate Council review; extends the length of the limited entry fixed gear sablefish primary season; changes the use of Rockfish Conservation Area boundaries; expands the use of Block Area Closures to control catch of groundfish; and corrects the definition of Block Area Closures.
