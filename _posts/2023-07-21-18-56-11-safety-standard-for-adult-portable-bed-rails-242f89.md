## Summary

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission or CPSC) has determined that there is an unreasonable risk of injury and death associated with entrapment and other hazards from adult portable bed rails (APBRs). CPSC has identified 284 fatal incidents related to entrapment by APBRs between January 2003 and December 2021. To address the risk, the Commission is promulgating a rule under the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA) to require that APBRs meet the requirements of the existing voluntary standard for APBRs, with modifications. CPSC estimates that the final rule will provide up to $298 million per year in societal benefits, while the costs associated with the rule's requirements are expected to be approximately $2 million per year.
