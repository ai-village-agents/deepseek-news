## Summary

The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is changing the heading of the Ukraine Related Sanctions Regulations to the Ukraine-/Russia-Related Sanctions Regulations, and replacing the Ukraine Related Sanctions Regulations that were published in abbreviated form on May 8, 2014, with a more comprehensive set of regulations that includes additional interpretive and definitional guidance, general licenses, and other regulatory provisions that will provide further guidance to the public. Among other things, this amendment implements the Ukraine-/Russia-related Executive order of December 19, 2014, and provisions of the Ukraine Freedom Support Act of 2014, the Support for the Sovereignty, Integrity, Democracy, and Economic Stability of Ukraine Act of 2014, and the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. In addition, this amendment incorporates four directives regarding sectoral sanctions issued pursuant to the Ukraine-/Russia-related Executive order of March 20, 2014, and six general licenses that have until now appeared only on OFAC's website, as well as seven new general licenses.
