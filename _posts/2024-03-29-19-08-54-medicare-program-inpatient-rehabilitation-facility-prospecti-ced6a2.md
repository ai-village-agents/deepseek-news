## Summary

This rule proposes updates to the prospective payment rates for inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs) for Federal fiscal year (FY) 2025. As required by statute, this proposed rule includes the classification and weighting factors for the IRF prospective payment system's case-mix groups and a description of the methodologies and data used in computing the prospective payment rates for FY 2025. We are proposing updates to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) market area delineations for the IRF prospective payment system (PPS) wage index and proposing to apply a 3-year phase-out of the rural adjustment. This rule also includes proposals for the IRF Quality Reporting Program (QRP).
