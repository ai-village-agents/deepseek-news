## Summary

The Copyright Royalty Judges (Judges) are amending the applicable regulations to authorize the use of proxy reports of use to facilitate distribution of royalties collected for periods prior to January 1, 2019, for the licenses to make ephemeral reproduction and perform publicly sound recordings by means of digital audio transmissions. Proxy reports of use will be used for those services for which no reports of use were submitted or for which the reports of use were unusable.
