## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-22-05, which applies to all Leonardo S.p.a. (Leonardo) Model A119 and AW119 MKII helicopters. AD 2021-22-05 requires repetitively inspecting certain torque tube assemblies for any deficiency and corrective action if necessary, and replacing any affected part with a serviceable part, which is terminating action for the repetitive inspections. AD 2021-22-05 was prompted by reports of abnormal play on the collective torque tube on two Leonardo Model AW119 MKII helicopters, which were due to an erroneous manufacturing process. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-22-05, it was discovered that additional torque tube assemblies are subject to the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would retain certain requirements specified in AD 2021-22- 05, reduce the applicability to include helicopters with only affected part-numbered collective torque tube assemblies, reduce the inspection intervals, and remove the previously approved terminating action as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
