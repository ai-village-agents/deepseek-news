## Summary

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to establish the 2,415-acre "Wanapum Village" American viticultural area (AVA) in Grant County, Washington. The proposed AVA area is located entirely within the existing Columbia Valley AVA. TTB designates viticultural areas to allow vintners to better describe the origin of their wines and to allow consumers to better identify wines they may purchase. TTB invites comments on these proposals.
