## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-8, 737-9, and 737-8200 (737 MAX) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of cracks in the bear strap at the forward upper corner of the forward galley door cutout. This proposed AD would require an inspection of the fuselage skin for existing repairs and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
