## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model SA341G and SA342J helicopters. This AD was prompted by reports of disbonding of the stainless steel leading edge protection of certain part-numbered main rotor blades (MRB). This AD requires repetitively tap inspecting the MRB and, depending on the results, repairing or replacing the MRB. This AD also prohibits installing those MRB unless certain requirements are met. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
