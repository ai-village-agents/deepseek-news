## Summary

In this final rule, NMFS implements bottomfish annual catch limits (ACL), and annual catch targets (ACT) and accountability measures (AM) to correct or mitigate any overages, for Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). The ACLs, ACTs, and AMs are effective for fishing years 2020-2022 in Guam, and for 2020-2023 in the CNMI. This rule also makes a minor technical correction to the regulations. This action supports the long-term sustainability of the bottomfish fisheries in the Mariana Archipelago.
