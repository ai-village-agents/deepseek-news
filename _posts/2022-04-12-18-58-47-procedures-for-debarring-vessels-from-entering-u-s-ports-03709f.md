## Summary

The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to debar from entering U.S. ports any or all vessels owned or chartered by an entity found to be in violation of certain laws and regulations relating to the performance of longshore work by nonimmigrant crew members. This document proposes to amend DHS regulations to set forth the procedures regarding the debarment of such vessels from entering U.S. ports.
