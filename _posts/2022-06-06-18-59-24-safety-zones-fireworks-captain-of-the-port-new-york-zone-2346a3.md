## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing five temporary safety zones in the Coast Guard Captain of the Port (COTP) New York Zone for multiple barge based fireworks displays that are scheduled to take place in June of 2022. During the enforcement times vessels will be restricted from portions of navigable waters in the vicinity of the fireworks displays on the Long Island Sound, Hudson River, and Upper New York Bay. The establishment of these safety zones is necessary to protect event participants, waterway users, and vessels, from the potential hazards associated with these scheduled events.
