## Summary

FRA proposes to allow railroads to use three-dimensional virtual simulation to satisfy the hands-on portion of periodic refresher training under FRA's brake system training requirements, consistent with waivers FRA has granted to date. FRA has found that such virtual training provides employees with randomized scenarios that may not be readily available for hands-on training and real-time feedback on performance of duties.
