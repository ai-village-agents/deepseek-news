## Summary

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is evaluating and improving the specification for achieving interoperability of containerized computational software. Adherence to a specification for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) Containerized Computational Software (FAIR-CCS) enables better reuse of containerized tools in complex data analyses by chaining tools into computational workflows. NIST requests information from the community on approaches to achieving interoperability of containerized software, designing a container manifest file that meets the community needs, and lowering the barrier for constructing such a manifest file. Responses to this RFI will also inform a possible revision of the current approach to achieving FAIR-CCS via a manifest file, the entries in the current manifest file specification of FAIR-CCS, and the current tools that aim at automating adherence to the FAIR-CCS manifest specification. NIST will host a workshop on FAIR-CCS at the times and location indicated below and will discuss the responses to this RFI at the workshop.
