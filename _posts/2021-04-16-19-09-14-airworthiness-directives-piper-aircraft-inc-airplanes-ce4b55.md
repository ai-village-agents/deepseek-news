## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-04-07 which applied to certain Piper Aircraft, Inc., (Piper) Models PA-46- 350P (Malibu Mirage), PA-46R-350T (Malibu Matrix), and PA-46-500TP (Malibu Meridian) airplanes. AD 2021-04-07 required identifying and correcting nonconforming stall warning heat control systems. Since AD 2021-04-07 was issued, the FAA was notified of an error in the stall warning heat control modification kit part number. This AD retains all of the actions in AD 2021-04-07 and corrects the incorrect modification kit part number. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
