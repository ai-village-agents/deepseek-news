## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain ATR--GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42- 500 and ATR72-212A airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of loose fasteners and cracks in the horizontal stabilizer (HS) left- and right-hand leading edge lateral ribs, the box in between, the center box upper panel, and HS forward back-up fitting. This proposed AD would require an inspection of the HS affected areas for discrepancies and applicable corrective action, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
