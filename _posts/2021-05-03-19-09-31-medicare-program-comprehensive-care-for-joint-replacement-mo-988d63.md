## Summary

This final rule extends the length of the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) model through December 31, 2024 by adding an additional 3 performance years (PYs). PY 6 will begin on October 1, 2021 and end on December 31, 2022; PY 7 will begin on January 1, 2023 and end on December 31, 2023; and PY 8 will begin on January 1, 2024 and end on December 31, 2024. In addition, this final rule revises certain aspects of the CJR model including the episode of care definition, the target price calculation, the reconciliation process, the beneficiary notice requirements, and the appeals process. In addition, for PY 6 through 8, this final rule eliminates the 50 percent cap on gainsharing payments, distribution payments, and downstream distribution payments for certain recipients. This final rule extends the additional flexibilities provided to participant hospitals related to certain Medicare program rules consistent with the revised episode of care definition.
