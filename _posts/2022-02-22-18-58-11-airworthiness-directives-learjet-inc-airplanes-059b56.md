## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Learjet, Inc., Model 35, 35A (C-21A), 36, 36A, 55, 55B, 55C, and 60 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report indicating that a repair station approved Learjet spoiler assemblies for return to service after extending their life limit. This AD requires removing certain spoiler assemblies from service and prohibits their installation. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
