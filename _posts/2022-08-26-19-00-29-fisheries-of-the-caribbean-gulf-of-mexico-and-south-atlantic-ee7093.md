## Summary

NMFS announces the receipt of an application for an exempted fishing permit (EFP) from Texas Sea Grant. If granted, the EFP would authorize the testing of new bycatch reduction device (BRD) designs in the commercial shrimp fishery in Federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf). The Better BRDs for the Gulf Shrimp Fleet Project is a collaborative effort amongst Louisiana Sea Grant, Texas Sea Grant, NOAA Restoration Center, and NMFS to restore finfish populations impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (MC252) through the development and certification of new BRDs for the commercial shrimp industry throughout the Gulf.
