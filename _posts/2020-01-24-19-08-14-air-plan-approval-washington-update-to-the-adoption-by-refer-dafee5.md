## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is revising the Washington State Implementation Plan (SIP) to approve updates to the Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council (EFSEC) air quality regulations. The EFSEC regulations apply to major energy facilities in the State of Washington and establish permitting requirements and emissions standards for such facilities. The EFSEC regulations primarily adopt by reference the Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology) general air quality regulations for program implementation. We are approving EFSEC's updated adoption by reference to include certain changes to Ecology's general air quality regulations since EFSEC's last adoption by reference, consistent with prior approvals.
