## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing for public comment a draft NUREG entitled, "Methodology for Modeling Transient Fires in Nuclear Power Plant Fire Probabilistic Risk Assessments" (NUREG-2233/EPRI 3002016054). This report is a joint product of the NRC and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) collaborating under a memorandum of understanding for fire research. This report contains a methodology to increase the realism in the modeling of transient ignition sources in fire probabilistic risk assessment (FPRA). Additionally, the report develops a method for the detailed modeling of transient fires that includes fire growth and decay parameters, yields of minor products of combustion, heat of combustion, and the physical size and effective elevation of the fire.
