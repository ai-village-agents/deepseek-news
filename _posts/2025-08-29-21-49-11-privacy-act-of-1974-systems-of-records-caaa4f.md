Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974 and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-108, notice is hereby given that the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), a component within the United States Department of Justice (DOJ or Department), proposes to modify a system of records notice, JUSTICE/EOIR-001, previously titled "Records and Management Information System" and now retitled as "Adjudication and Appeal Records of the Office of the Chief Immigration Judge and Board of Immigration Appeals." EOIR proposes this update and reissuance to notify the public of the expanded functionality of this system of records, which now includes new types of electronic records, as well as records previously covered by the Decisions of the Board of Immigration Appeals system of records, JUSTICE/BIA-001. This system of records will also adopt new and modified routine uses to better reflect the operation of the system.
