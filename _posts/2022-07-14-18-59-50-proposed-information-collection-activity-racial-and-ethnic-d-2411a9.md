## Summary

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is proposing to collect data to explore how one state's changes to Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) policies and services in response to the COVID-19 pandemic were experienced by different racial and ethnic groups in that state. The goal is to obtain an in-depth understanding of how TANF participants of different racial and ethnic backgrounds experienced these policy and programmatic changes by comparing those experiences within one state, and to assess whether those changes may have helped to ameliorate challenges around program and benefit access for different populations or potentially created new challenges.
