## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to grant United Parcel Service, Inc.'s (UPS) application for an exemption from certain provisions of the Agency's commercial driver's license (CDL) regulations. The exemption allows UPS to conduct behind-the-wheel training for commercial learner's permit (CLP) holders in twin 28-foot trailers, rather than waiting to conduct the training after the individuals receive their Class A CDLs and pass the required knowledge test to obtain the double/triple trailer endorsement on their CDLs. FMCSA has analyzed the exemption application and the public comments and has determined that the exemptions, subject to the terms and conditions imposed, will likely achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent such exemption.
