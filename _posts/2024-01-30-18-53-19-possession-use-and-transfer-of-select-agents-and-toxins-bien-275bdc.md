## Summary

In accordance with the Public Health Service Act, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reviewed the HHS list of select agents and toxins with the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety. HHS/CDC proposes to amend the list by removing three biological agents, raising one toxin's exclusion amounts, renaming a virus, designating a current agent as a Tier 1 agent, and removing the designation of Tier 1 status from one agent. HHS/CDC also proposes to clarify language and add requirements as discussed below.
