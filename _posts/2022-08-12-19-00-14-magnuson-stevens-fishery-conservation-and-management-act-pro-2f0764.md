## Summary

The Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council has submitted Amendment 22 to the Summer Flounder, Scup, and Black Sea Bass Fishery Management Plan to NMFS. Amendment 22 proposes revisions to the summer flounder, scup, and black sea bass commercial and recreational allocation percentages. This action would also add the option for future modifications to the commercial/recreational allocation and transfer provisions to be considered through a framework action. Amendment 22 is intended to address the allocation-related impacts of the revised recreational catch and landings data provided by the Marine Recreational Information Program.
