## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Georgia, through the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) via a letter dated October 20, 2022. The revision seeks to change Georgia's Rules for Air Quality Control in the SIP by removing the 1971 annual and 24-hour ambient air quality primary standard for sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>), which no longer apply in Georgia as of April 30, 2022. EPA is approving this SIP revision because the State has demonstrated that this change is consistent with the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act).
