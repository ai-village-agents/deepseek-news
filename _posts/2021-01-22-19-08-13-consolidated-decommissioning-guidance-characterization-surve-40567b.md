## Summary

On December 8, 2020, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued a draft report for comment, NUREG-1757, Volume 2, Revision 2, "Consolidated Decommissioning Guidance, Characterization, Survey, and Determination of Radiological Criteria." The public comment period was originally scheduled to close on February 8, 2021. The NRC has decided to extend the public comment period to allow more time for members of the public to develop and submit their comments. Additionally, the NRC staff would like to announce that it will hold a public meeting on Monday, March 15, 2021, to discuss updates to the guidance document and provide members of the public an opportunity to comment on the draft guidance document. Details regarding the public meeting and agenda will be forthcoming on the NRC's public website https://www.nrc.gov/pmns/mtg.
