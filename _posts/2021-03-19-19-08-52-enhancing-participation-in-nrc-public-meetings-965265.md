## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has revised its policy statement, "Enhancing Participation in NRC Public Meetings," to further clarify and enhance participation in public meetings conducted by the NRC. The revised policy statement redefines the three categories of public meetings and identifies the level of public participation offered at each category of meeting. The revised policy statement also clarifies notification expectations for meetings that include physical presence in the meeting room and meetings that rely solely on remote access technology such as teleconferencing. The revisions will improve the consistency of the NRC's public meetings and help participants better prepare for NRC meetings.
