## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2012-04-15 for all Pratt & Whitney (PW) JT9D-3A, JT9D-7, JT9D-7A, JT9D-7AH, JT9D- 7F, JT9D-7H, JT9D-7J, JT9D-7Q, JT9D-7Q3, JT9D-7R4D, JT9D-7R4D1, JT9D- 7R4E, JT9D-7R4E1, JT9D-7R4E4, JT9D-7R4G2, JT9D-7R4H1, JT9D-20, JT9D- 20J, JT9D-59A, and JT9D-70A (JT9D) model turbofan engines. AD 2012-04- 15 required revisions to the Airworthiness Limitations Section (ALS) of the manufacturer's Instructions for Continued Airworthiness (ICA) to include required enhanced inspection of selected critical life-limited parts at each piece-part opportunity. AD 2012-04-15 also required additional revisions to the ALS of the manufacturer's ICA for JT9D model turbofan engines. This AD requires revising the required inspections of selected critical life-limited parts specified in the ALS of the manufacturer's ICA and, for air carriers, to the existing continuous airworthiness air carrier maintenance program (CAMP). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
