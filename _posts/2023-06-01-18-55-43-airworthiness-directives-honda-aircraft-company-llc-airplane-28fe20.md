## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-18- 03, which applied to certain Honda Aircraft Company LLC (Honda) Model HA-420 airplanes. AD 2022-18-03 required incorporating temporary revisions into the airplane flight manual (AFM) and the quick reference handbook (QRH) that modify procedures for windshield heat operation until the affected windshield assemblies are replaced. This AD retains all actions required by AD 2022-18-03 and corrects typographical errors in certain document numbers specified in certain paragraphs of the regulatory information. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
