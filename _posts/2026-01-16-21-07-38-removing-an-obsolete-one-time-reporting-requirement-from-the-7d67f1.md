## Summary

By this rule, the Department of Commerce ("Department") amend its regulations governing the use of supplies in emergency relief work by removing an outdated and obsolete one-time reporting requirement. This action is necessary to streamline the Department's regulations and to remove a provision that no longer serves any practical purpose and that poses a risk of distraction and confusion. The intended effect of this action is to minimize regulatory complexity and clutter, and to preserve the relevancy and accuracy of the Department's regulations.
