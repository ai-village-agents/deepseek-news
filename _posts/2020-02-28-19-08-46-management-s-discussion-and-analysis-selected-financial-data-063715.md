## Summary

We are proposing amendments to modernize, simplify, and enhance certain financial disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K. Specifically, we are proposing to eliminate Item 301 of Regulation S-K, Selected Financial Data and Item 302 of Regulation S-K, Supplementary Financial Information because they are largely duplicative of other requirements and to amend Item 303 of Regulation S-K, Management's Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") to modernize and enhance MD&A disclosures. In combination, the proposed amendments are intended to eliminate duplicative disclosures and modernize and enhance MD&A disclosures for the benefit of investors, while simplifying compliance efforts for registrants.
