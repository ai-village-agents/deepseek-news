## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model SA341G and SA342J helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of corrosion on the contact surfaces of the tail rotor inclined and horizontal drive shaft flanges. This proposed AD would require repetitively inspecting the inclined and horizontal drive shaft flanges and, depending on the results, replacing the inclined or horizontal drive shaft. This proposed AD would also prohibit installing certain inclined and horizontal drive shafts unless certain requirements are met, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
