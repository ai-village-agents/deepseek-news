## Summary

Consistent with the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, as amended by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015 ("2015 Act"), HUD annually publishes a final rule adjusting its civil money penalty amounts for inflation according to the formula provided by the 2015 Act. In these rules, HUD does not apply the adjustments retroactively and provides that the inflation-adjusted penalty amounts apply to violations occurring on or after the rule's effective date. HUD is considering revising this approach, however, and annually applying inflation-adjusted penalty amounts to violations assessed after the date of inflation, if the violation occurred after the enactment of the 2015 Act. Through this request for comments, HUD seeks public input on the impact of applying inflation-adjusted penalty amounts on the date the penalty is assessed rather than the date of the violation.
