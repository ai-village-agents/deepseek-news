## Summary

The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is easing export controls on certain civil Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and related technologies, which currently need a license to be exported to most countries. In particular, this interim final rule (IFR): a) allows less sensitive UAVs--namely, commercial UAVs with a maximum endurance of less than one hour, for which there is broad foreign availability--to be exported to most Wassenaar Arrangement Participating States (Country Group A:1) without a license; and b) allows more capable non-military UAVs--namely, certain long-range cargo delivery and agricultural spraying drones--to be exported to certain U.S. partners and allies (Country Group A:5) under License Exception Strategic Trade Authorization (STA). Exports pursuant to License Exception STA are subject to notification and reporting requirements to ensure the security of the exports. BIS is making these changes pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 14307, "Unleashing American Drone Dominance."
