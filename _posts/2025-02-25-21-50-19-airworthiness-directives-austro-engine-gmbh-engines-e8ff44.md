## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-20-03 for certain Austro Engine GmbH Model E4 and E4P engines. AD 2023-20-03 required repetitive engine oil analysis for aluminum content outside the acceptable limits and, if necessary, replacement of the pistons, piston rings, con-rods assembly, and crankcase or, as an alternative, replacement of the engine core. Since the FAA issued AD 2023-20-03, the manufacturer identified errors in the lists of affected engines and provided updated information, which prompted this AD. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2023-20-03, adds compliance times for additional affected engine serial numbers, and removes certain engine serial numbers from the applicability of the existing AD. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
