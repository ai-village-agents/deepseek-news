## Summary

The Department of Education (Department) proposes to establish a priority and definition under the Teacher and School Leader Incentive Program (TSL), Assistance Listing Number 84.374A. We may use this priority and definition for competitions in fiscal year (FY) 2021 and later years. We propose a priority that clarifies the extent to which TSL-funded grant project activities are concentrated in High-Need Schools and a definition that clarifies what High-Need School means for the purposes of the TSL program.
