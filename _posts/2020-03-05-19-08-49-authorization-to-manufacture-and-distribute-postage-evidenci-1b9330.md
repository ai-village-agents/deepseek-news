## Summary

The Postal Service is amending its Postage Evidencing Systems regulations. These changes put the financial responsibility for returned checks and returned Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) debit payments on the applicable resetting company (RC) and PC Postage provider. These responsibilities include providing reimbursement for any penalties or fines imposed on the Postal Service for returned checks or ACH debit payments, and remitting the amount of the returned check or ACH debit payment, as applicable, plus the reimbursement to the Postal Service within 10 federal banking days of the date the invoice is mailed. These changes also update the Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) 18 requirements and add the requirement for System and Organization Control (SOC) 2 reporting.
