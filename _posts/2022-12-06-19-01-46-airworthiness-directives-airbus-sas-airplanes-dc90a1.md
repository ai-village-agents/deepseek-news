## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-22-16, AD 2021-16-01, and AD 2022-04-03, which apply to certain Airbus SAS Model A318, A320 and A321 series airplanes; and Model A319- 111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, -133, -151N, and -153N airplanes. AD 2020-22-16, AD 2021-16-01, and AD 2022-04-03 require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-22-16, AD 2021-16-01, and AD 2022-04-03, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2020-22-16, AD 2021-16-01, and AD 2022-04-03, and would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate additional new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
