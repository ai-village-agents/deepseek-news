## Summary

This action proposes to amend Very High Frequency (VHF) Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-71 and V-245, revoke VOR Federal airways V-554 and V-570, and establish Area Navigation (RNAV) routes T-471, T-473, and T-474. The FAA is proposing this action due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Natchez, MS (HEZ), VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) navigational aid (NAVAID). The Natchez VOR is being decommissioned in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
