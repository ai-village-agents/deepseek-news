## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) submits an annual Contract Bundling Report to Congress which provides the total bundled contract dollars and information regarding bundled contracts for the prior fiscal year (FY). Section 873 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY 2023 amended the U.S. Code (U.S.C.) requiring data and information on the consolidation of contract requirements to be included in the annual Contract Bundling and Consolidation Report to Congress. Beginning in December 2023, the Federal agencies shall provide data and information on all bundled or consolidated contract requirements in their annual reports to SBA.
