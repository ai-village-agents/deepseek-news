## Summary

The FAA is removing Airworthiness Directive (AD) 92-02-14, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A320 series airplanes. AD 92- 02-14 required inspection for correct installation of the flexible control cables on the overwing emergency escape slides. The FAA issued AD 92-02-14 to prevent failure of the overwing emergency escape slides to deploy, which would compromise use of the exit during an emergency. Since the FAA issued AD 92-02-14, no new occurrences of incorrect cable installations have been reported, and existing maintenance activities are adequate to prevent new occurrences. Therefore, the FAA has determined that AD 92-02-14 is no longer necessary. Accordingly, AD 92- 02-14 is removed.
