## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS; collectively, the "Services"), propose to revise portions of our regulations for section 4 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (ESA or Act). The proposed revisions to the regulations clarify and interpret portions of the Act concerning the procedures and criteria used for listing, reclassifying, and delisting species on the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants and designating critical habitat.
