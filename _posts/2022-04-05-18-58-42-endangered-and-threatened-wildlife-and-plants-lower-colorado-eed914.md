## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, announce a finding on a petition to list the Lower Colorado River basin distinct population segment (DPS) of the roundtail chub (Gila robusta) as an endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). After a thorough review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that it is not warranted at this time to list the Lower Colorado River roundtail chub DPS as an endangered or threatened species. However, in conducting the necessary research to inform this petition finding, we have determined that we should consider removing the Gila chub (Gila intermedia) from the protections of the Act. Therefore, this document includes an advance notice of proposed rulemaking pertaining to removing the Gila chub, currently listed as endangered, from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. We ask the public to submit to us any information relevant to the status of these species or their habitats.
