## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Fire Fighter Fatality Investigation and Prevention Program Survey which will evaluate fire department implementation of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Fire Fighter Fatality Investigation and Prevention Program (FFFIPP) recommendations. The evaluation will assess whether NIOSH FFFIPP recommendations are utilized by fire departments, identify barriers to implementation of recommendations, and identify areas for potential intervention projects.
