# Airworthiness Directives; MHI RJ Aviation ULC (Type Certificate Previously Held by Bombardier, Inc.) Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain MHI RJ Aviation ULC Model CL-600-2B19 (Regional Jet Series 100 & 440) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that a certain nondestructive test (NDT) procedure associated with a certain airworthiness limitation for inspecting surface and subsurface fatigue cracks at fuselage station (FS) 460 and FS513 does not address all required inspections. This proposed AD would require using a revised NDT procedure when performing an airworthiness limitation task. This proposed AD would also prohibit the use of earlier revisions of that NDT procedure. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
