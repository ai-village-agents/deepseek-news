## Summary

Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974 the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is proposing to establish two new systems of records: (1) PBGC-27: Ensuring Workplace Health and Safety in Response to a Public Health Emergency; and (2) PBGC-28: Physical Security and Facility Access. PBGC-27 will maintain information collected to assist PBGC with maintaining a safe and healthy workplace and to protect PBGC staff working on-site from risks associated with a public health emergency (as defined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and declared by its Secretary), such as a pandemic or epidemic. PBGC-28 will maintain information collected while providing visitor, employee, and government contractor access control; physical and operational security; and video surveillance for PBGC facilities.
