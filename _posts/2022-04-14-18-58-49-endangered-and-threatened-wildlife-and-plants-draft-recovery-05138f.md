## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce the availability of our Mexican Wolf (Canis lupus baileyi) Draft Recovery Plan, Second Revision (draft revised recovery plan). The Mexican wolf is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (ESA), and is currently found in Arizona and New Mexico in the United States, and in Sonora and Chihuahua, Mexico. The draft revised recovery plan includes new site-specific management actions to address the threat of human-caused mortality, including illegal take, in response to a court-ordered remand of the Mexican Wolf Recovery Plan, First Revision (2017 recovery plan). These new actions, as well as their time and cost estimates, are incorporated into the draft revised recovery plan implementation schedule. We provide the rationale for each action in a new section of the draft revised recovery plan ("Recovery Actions Added to the Implementation Schedule to Address Human-Caused Mortality"). The draft revised recovery plan provides minor clarifying updates to explain the addition of the recovery actions but does not alter the recovery strategy or recovery criteria for the Mexican wolf. We request review and comment on the draft recovery plan from local, State, and Federal agencies; Tribes; and the public, in both the United States and Mexico.
