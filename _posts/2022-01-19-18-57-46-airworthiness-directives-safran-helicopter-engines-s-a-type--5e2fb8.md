## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2005-12-08 for certain Safran Helicopter Engines, S.A. (Safran Helicopter Engines) Arrius 2B1, 2B1A, 2B1A-1, and 2B2 model turboshaft engines. AD 2005-12- 08 required replacing the software in the engine electronic control unit (EECU). This AD was prompted by a report of simultaneous loss of automatic control on both engines installed on an Airbus Helicopters Deutschland (formerly Eurocopter Deutschland) EC135 helicopter during flight. This AD requires replacement of the EECU or upgrade of the EECU software for engines with a certain EECU part number (P/N) installed. This AD also prohibits installation of an affected EECU onto any engine. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
