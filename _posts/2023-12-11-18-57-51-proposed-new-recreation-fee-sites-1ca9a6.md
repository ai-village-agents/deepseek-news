## Summary

The Tahoe National Forest is proposing to establish a new recreation fee site and a new annual recreation pass. Recreation fee revenues collected at the new recreation fee site would be used for operation, maintenance, and improvement of the new site. Recreation fee revenues collected from the new annual pass would be used for operation, maintenance, and improvement of the standard amenity recreation fee sites listed in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section of this notice. An analysis of nearby recreation fee sites with similar amenities shows the recreation fees that would be charged at the new recreation fee site and the fees collected from the annual pass are reasonable and typical of similar recreation fee sites in the area.
