## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve state implementation plan (SIP) revisions and two redesignation requests provided by the State of Florida, through the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), related to the 2010 1-hour sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) primary national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS or standard). Specifically, EPA is approving a December 1, 2017, SIP revision (as supplemented through an October 9, 2019, SIP revision discussed below) that includes SO<INF>2</INF> multi-unit permit limits and associated compliance and monitoring parameters for Mosaic Fertilizer LLC's New Wales facility (Mosaic New Wales) and Bartow facility (Mosaic Bartow), both located in Polk County, Florida. The December 1, 2017, SIP revision also includes a modeling analysis to demonstrate that the Hillsborough-Polk SO<INF>2</INF> nonattainment area (hereinafter referred to as the "Hillsborough-Polk Area") attains the SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS with these permit limits. EPA is also approving an October 9, 2019, request to redesignate the Hillsborough-Polk Area to attainment for the 1-hour SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS and associated SIP revision containing the State's plan for maintaining attainment of the standard in the Hillsborough- Polk Area. The October 9, 2019, SIP submittal also revises the modeling analysis and some permit conditions in the 2017 SIP revision, contains a base-year emissions inventory for the Hillsborough-Polk Area, and certifies that the Hillsborough-Polk Area meets nonattainment new source review (NNSR) requirements. In addition, EPA is approving an October 9, 2019, request to redesignate the Mulberry Unclassifiable Area (hereinafter referred to as the "Mulberry Area") to attainment/ unclassifiable for the 2010 1-hour SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS. FDEP submitted a draft version of the October 9, 2019, redesignation requests and SIP revisions on February 15, 2019, and EPA proposed to approve those requests and revisions through parallel processing at the State's request.
