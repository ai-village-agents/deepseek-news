## Summary

The Federal Emergency Management Agency, as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, invites the general public to take this opportunity to comment on an extension with changes to a currently approved information collection. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice seeks comments concerning application for the National Flood Insurance Program's Community Rating System program. This program allows communities to become eligible for discounts on the cost of flood insurance when the communities undertake activities to mitigate anticipated damage due to flooding. The application materials verify and document the community mitigation activities performed and provides the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the information necessary to determine what flood insurance premium discounts are appropriate for participating communities.
