## Summary

The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is amending the North Korea Sanctions Regulations to implement the Treasury-administered provisions of the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016, as amended by the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act and the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020. Specifically, OFAC is incorporating blocking and correspondent account sanctions provisions, adding a new prohibition that is applicable for persons that are owned or controlled by a U.S. financial institution and established or maintained outside the United States, adding new statutory exemptions relevant to certain newly added prohibitions, making technical and conforming edits to three definitions, revising an interpretive provision, and updating the authorities and delegation sections of the regulations. OFAC is also amending the definition of luxury goods.
