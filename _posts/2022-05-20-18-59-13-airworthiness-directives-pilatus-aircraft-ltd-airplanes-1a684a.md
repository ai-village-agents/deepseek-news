## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Pilatus Aircraft Ltd. (Pilatus) Model PC-12/47E airplanes. This AD was prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as a batch of incorrectly sized fuel transfer ejector nozzles that were installed on Model PC-12/47E airplanes during production. This AD requires removing the affected fuel transfer ejectors from service and prohibits installation of the affected fuel transfer ejectors. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
