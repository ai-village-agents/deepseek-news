## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2015-04-04 for Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. (Bell) Model 412 and 412EP helicopters. AD 2015-04-04 required revising the Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) for your helicopter and installing a placard to limit flights to visual flight rules (VFR) and prohibit night operations because of failing inverters. This AD requires replacing the affected inverter with a new inverter. This AD was prompted by numerous failures of inverters. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
