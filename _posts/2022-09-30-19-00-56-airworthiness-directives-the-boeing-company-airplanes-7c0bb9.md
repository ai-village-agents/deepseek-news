## Summary

The FAA is correcting an airworthiness directive (AD) that was published in the Federal Register. That AD superseded AD 2015-12-03, and applies to all The Boeing Company Model 777-200, -200LR, -300, and -300ER series airplanes, and certain Model 777F airplanes. As published, a freeplay indicator value in the regulatory text is incorrect, and certain credit service information was omitted for certain actions in the regulatory text. This document corrects those errors. In all other respects, the original document remains the same.
