## Summary

ACF, ORR announces the intent to award five single-source awards in the amount of $9,118,248, in multiple states across the country, for Long Term Foster Care (LTFC) services for Unaccompanied Children. ORR proposes to have the recipient conduct the following activities: provide additional capacity for long term placement services. The action is needed because ORR has a pending list with over 300 minors on it who need LTFC placement due to the unanticipated influx of unaccompanied children at the southwestern border in 2021 and the unforeseen arrival of Unaccompanied Afghan Minors (UAM) over the past year.
