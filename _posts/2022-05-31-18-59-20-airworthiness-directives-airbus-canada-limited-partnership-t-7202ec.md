## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500- 1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports that the inflation valve safety pin has been found installed on the nitrogen bottle of a certain escape slide in-service and may be installed on the nitrogen bottles of certain other escape slides on other airplanes in-service. This AD requires inspecting the inflation valve of the nitrogen bottle of the escape slide for the presence of the safety pin, and if the safety pin is installed, removing the safety pin from the inflation valve and stowing it in the safety pin stowage pouch of the escape slide, as specified in a Transport Canada Civil Aviation (TCCA) Emergency AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
