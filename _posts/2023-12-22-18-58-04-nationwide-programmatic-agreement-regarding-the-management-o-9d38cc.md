## Summary

NASA is proposing a nationwide programmatic agreement (NPA), among NASA, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) and the National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers (NCSHPO) for management of NASA assets. The purpose of the NPA is to create a process by which NASA can meet its responsibilities to manage its U.S. real property assets under sections 106 and 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) in a manner that accommodates NASA's mission and addresses the unique challenges of historic highly technical and scientific facilities (HTSF). The need for a tailored process became more essential in 2015, when the Office of Management and Budget released the "National Strategy for the Efficient Use of Real Property" and the companion policy, "Reduce the Footprint", which requires Federal agencies to dispose of surplus properties, make more efficient use of the Government's real property assets, and reduce the total square footage of their domestic office and warehouse inventory relative to an established baseline. NASA requests comments on the proposed agreement.
