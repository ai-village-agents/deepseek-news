## Summary

On July 20, 2018, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a Notice of Availability of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Louisiana Trustee Implementation Group (Louisiana TIG) Final Restoration Plan and Environmental Assessment #4: Nutrient Reduction (Nonpoint Source) and Recreational Use (RP/EA #4). The Louisiana TIG is considering modifications to the Cypremort Point State Park Improvements (Cypremort Improvements) project originally described in the RP/EA #4. The modifications being considered include replacing the original proposed breakwater system project feature with construction of a recreational vehicle (RV) campground, associated infrastructure, and amenities at the park. In accordance with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Federal and State natural resource trustee agencies for the Louisiana TIG prepared a Draft Supplemental Restoration Plan and Environmental Assessment for the Cypremort Point State Park Improvements Project Modification (Supplemental RP/EA). The Supplemental RP/EA evaluates modifications to the Cypremort Improvements project and alternatives considered by the Louisiana TIG under criteria set forth in the OPA natural resource damage assessment (NRDA) regulations and evaluates the environmental effects in accordance with the NEPA. The modifications under consideration to the Cypremort Improvements project are consistent with the restoration alternatives selected in the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Final Programmatic Damage Assessment and Restoration Plan/Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PDARP/PEIS). This notice informs the public of the availability of the Supplemental RP/EA and provides an opportunity for the public to submit comments on the document.
