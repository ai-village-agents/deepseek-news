## Summary

We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), are reopening the public comment period due to a request for an extension of the public comment period to a proposed amendment to the Montana regulatory program (hereinafter, the Montana program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). During the 2023 legislative session, the Montana legislature passed Senate Bill 392 (SB 392), amending the Montana Strip and Underground Mine Reclamation Act (MSUMRA) as well as the Montana Code Annotated (MCA). Accordingly, Montana submitted this proposed amendment to OSMRE on its own initiative. This document gives the times and locations that the Montana program and this proposed amendment to the program are available for your inspection, the comment period during which you may submit written comments on the amendment, and the procedures that we will follow for the public hearing, if one is requested.
