## Summary

The Coast Guard announces that it has received approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for an information collection request associated with the interim rule requirements for fire safety on certain covered small passenger vessels. This rule announces the effective dates for the requirements for vessel operators to log the occurrence of passenger emergency egress drills and to post passenger safety bills in overnight accommodation spaces. In the interim rule, we stated we would publish a document in the Federal Register announcing the effective date of the collection-of- information related sections upon OMB approval. This rule establishes April 24, 2023 as the effective date for those sections.
