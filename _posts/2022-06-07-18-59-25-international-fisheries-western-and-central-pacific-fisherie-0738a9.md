## Summary

In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, this interim final rule extends the time period that temporary specifications issued to implement certain short-notice decisions of the Commission on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (Commission or WCPFC) may remain in effect. This action also extends temporary specifications to implement two short-notice WCPFC decisions. NMFS is undertaking this action under the authority of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Convention Implementation Act (WCPFC Implementation Act) to satisfy the obligations of the United States as a Contracting Party to the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (Convention). NMFS seeks comments on this interim final rule and will respond to those comments in a subsequent final rule.
