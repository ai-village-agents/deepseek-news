## Summary

This final rule reinterprets the scope of the general requirement that State payments for Medicaid services under a State plan must generally be made directly to the individual practitioner or institution providing services or to the beneficiary, in the case of a class of practitioners for which the Medicaid program is the primary source of revenue. Specifically, this final rule explicitly authorizes States to make payments to third parties on behalf of individual practitioners, for individual practitioners' health insurance and welfare benefits, skills training, and other benefits customary for employees, if the individual practitioner consents to such payments on their behalf.
