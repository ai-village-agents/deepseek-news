## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is proposing to disapprove a State Implementation Plan (SIP) submittal from the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, Department of Environmental Quality (DAQ) (herein after referred to as Kentucky or the Commonwealth) regarding the interstate transport requirements for the 2015 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or standard). The "Good Neighbor" or "Interstate Transport" provision requires that each state's implementation plan contain adequate provisions to prohibit emissions from within the state from significantly contributing to nonattainment or interfering with maintenance of the NAAQS in other states. This requirement is part of the broader set of "infrastructure" requirements, which are designed to ensure that the structural components of each state's air quality management program are adequate to meet the state's responsibilities under the CAA. This disapproval, if finalized, will establish a 2-year deadline for EPA to promulgate a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) to address the relevant interstate transport requirements, unless EPA approves a subsequent SIP submittal that meets these requirements. Disapproval does not start a mandatory sanctions clock.
