## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the DoD is establishing a new Department-wide system of records titled, "Defense Advisory Committees," DoD-0011. This system of records covers DoD's maintenance of records about proposed, appointed, and prior members of the DoD's Federal Advisory Committees, to include subcommittees, which are or not subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). Individuals may be appointed to serve on an advisory committee as a regular government employee, as a special government employee, or as a representative member when directed by statute. These records include information on individuals who applied to be on a committee/ subcommittee, were considered for, are currently serving on, and/or had previously served on a committee/subcommittee.
