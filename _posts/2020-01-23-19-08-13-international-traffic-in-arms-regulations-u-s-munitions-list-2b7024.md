## Summary

The Department of State (the Department) amends the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) to revise Categories I--firearms, close assault weapons and combat shotguns, II--guns and armament, and III--ammunition/ordnance of the U.S. Munitions List (USML) to describe more precisely the articles that provide a critical military or intelligence advantage or, in the case of weapons, perform an inherently military function and thus warrant export and temporary import control on the USML. These revisions complete the initial review of the USML that the Department began in 2011. Items not subject to the ITAR or to the exclusive licensing jurisdiction of any other set of regulations are subject to the Export Administration Regulations.
