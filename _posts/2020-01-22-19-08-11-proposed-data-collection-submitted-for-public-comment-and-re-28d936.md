## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on Statements in Support of Application of Waiver of Inadmissibility (0920-0006). CDC uses the information collected in 0920-0006 to review Class A medical waiver applications for prospective immigrants to the United States. CDC assists DHS/USCIS in determining whether or not a prospective immigrant with a Class A mental health designation may be admitted into the United States.
