## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC, the Commission) is issuing an order approving an application filed by the Dow Chemical Company (TDCC) on November 22, 2019. The application sought NRC approval of the indirect transfer of control of Renewed Facility Operating License No. R-108 for the Dow TRIGA Research Reactor (DTRR). The indirect transfer of control resulted from the merger of TDCC with E.I. du Pont De Nemours and Company in August 2017, which established a new parent company, DowDuPont, Inc. Subsequently, in April 2019, Dow, Inc. was formed as a separate company from DowDuPont, Inc. and TDCC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dow, Inc. The NRC determined that TDCC remains qualified to hold Renewed Facility Operating License No. R-108, and that the indirect transfer of the license is otherwise consistent with the applicable provisions of law, regulations, and orders issued by the Commission pursuant thereto. The NRC further determined that the indirect transfer of control of the license necessitated no changes to the license. The order is effective on the date it was issued.
