## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), the GSA is proposing a revision to an existing information collection request (ICR) for the Data Collection Form (SF-SAC) and associated FAC webform. The revisions add an optional resubmission pathway, optional structured fields within audit findings (questioned costs, criteria, condition, cause, effect, recommendation, response), optional Yes/No indicators to report whether the auditor became aware of known or likely fraud affecting a federal award or significant instances of abuse, and a new Yes/No webform field for auditor disclosures of a summary schedule of prior audit findings, consistent with 2 CFR 200.516(b)(6). This revision does not change the total estimated burden hours because the additions rely on information already required in audit reports.
