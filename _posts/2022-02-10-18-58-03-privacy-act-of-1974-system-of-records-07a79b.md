## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to modify an existing system of records titled, "DHS/Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-008 Disaster Recovery Assistance Files." This system of records describes DHS/FEMA's collection and maintenance of records on applicants for its Disaster Assistance programs that provide financial and other tangible assistance to survivors of presidentially declared disasters or emergencies. DHS/FEMA is modifying this system of records notice (SORN) to include: (1) Updating the system location; (2) clarifying the purpose of the SORN; (3) updating the categories of records; (4) updating the routine uses; (5) changing the retention and disposal schedule of records; and (6) updating record source categories. Additionally, this notice includes non-substantive changes to simplify the formatting and text of the previously published notice. This updated system will be included in DHS's inventory of record systems.
