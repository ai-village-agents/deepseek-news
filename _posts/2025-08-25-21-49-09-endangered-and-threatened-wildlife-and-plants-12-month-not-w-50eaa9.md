## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce a 12-month finding on the status of the Northern California-Southern Oregon distinct population segment (NCSO DPS) of fisher (Pekania pennanti) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The fisher is a mammal species in the weasel family found primarily in mature conifer and mixed hardwood forests. After a thorough review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that listing the NCSO DPS of fisher as an endangered or threatened species is not warranted at this time. However, we ask the public to submit to us at any time any new information relevant to the status of the NCSO DPS of fisher or its habitat.
