## Summary

The National Science Foundation's (NSF) Office of Polar Programs (OPP) and the Education and Human Resources (EHR) Directorate request input from interested parties on the goals, values, and approaches for managing the Antarctic Artist and Writers (AAW) Program and possibly expanding that program to include the Arctic. In addition, OPP and EHR request input into whether the NSF program which selects and sends educators to the Poles should be under a common management structure. This RFI will help inform NSF as it considers potential avenues for managing and enhancing education and outreach efforts related to polar science.
