## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to find that 12 States and local air pollution control agencies failed to submit State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions required by the Clean Air Act (CAA) in a timely manner to address EPA's 2015 findings of substantial inadequacy and "SIP calls" for provisions applying to excess emissions during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM). This action triggers certain CAA deadlines for the EPA to impose sanctions if a State does not submit a complete SIP revision addressing the outstanding requirements and to promulgate a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) if the EPA does not approve the State's submission as a SIP revision.
