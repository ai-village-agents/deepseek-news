## Summary

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) proposes to amend the Commission's regulations to require the Commission- certified Electric Reliability Organization to submit assessments of its performance every three years instead of the current period of every five years. The Commission also proposes to add to the Commission's regulations a requirement for the Electric Reliability Organization to include in its performance assessment a detailed discussion of any areas of the Electric Reliability Organization's responsibilities and activities, or a Regional Entity's delegated functions, beyond those required by the Commission's regulations, that the Commission has identified at least 90 days prior to the expected performance assessment submission date. Finally, the Commission proposes formalizing the method for the Electric Reliability Organization and Regional Entities to receive and respond to recommendations by the users, owners, and operators of the Bulk-Power System, and other interested parties for improvement of the Electric Reliability Organization's operations, activities, oversight and procedures.
