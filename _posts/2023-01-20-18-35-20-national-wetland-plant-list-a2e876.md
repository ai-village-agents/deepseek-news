## Summary

The National Wetland Plant List (NWPL) provides plant species indicator status ratings, which are used in determining whether the hydrophytic vegetation factor is met when conducting wetland delineations under the Clean Water Act and wetland determinations under the Wetland Conservation Provisions of the Food Security Act. Other applications of the NWPL include wetland restoration, establishment, and enhancement projects. To update the NWPL, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), as part of an interagency effort with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), is announcing the availability of the proposed changes to the 2022 NWPL and its web address to solicit public comments. The public will now have the opportunity to comment on the proposed changes to wetland indicator status ratings for two plant species in the Arid West (AW) region. In addition, we are accepting comments on the proposal to move from a two-year update cycle to a three-year update cycle for the NWPL. Finally, USACE is seeking comments on the overall NWPL update process.
