## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of Peptide Derived from Harpin Protein (PDHP) 25279 in or on all food commodities when used in accordance with label directions and good agricultural practices. Plant Health Care Inc., submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of PDHP 25279 under FFDCA when used in accordance with this exemption.
