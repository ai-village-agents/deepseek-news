## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-12- 12, which applied to all Embraer S.A. Model ERJ 170 airplanes and Model ERJ 190-100 STD, -100 LR, -100 ECJ, -100 IGW, -200 STD, -200 LR, and - 200 IGW airplanes. AD 2020-12-12 required repetitive detailed inspections for cracking of the engine inboard and outboard engine pylon lower link lugs, and repair if necessary. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2020-12-12 with certain reduced compliance times. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
