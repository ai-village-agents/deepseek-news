## Summary

This request for public comment serves as a complementary document to the Economic Growth Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act: Implementation of National Standards for the Physical Inspection of Real Estate (NSPIRE) proposed rule. The proposed rule provided that HUD would publish in the Federal Register the NSPIRE inspection standards and scoring methodology to assess the overall condition, health, and safety of properties and units assisted or insured by HUD. The NSPIRE Standards were published for public comment on June 17, 2022. HUD now seeks public review and comment on the proposed NSPIRE physical inspection scoring and ranking methodology to implement HUD's final NSPIRE rule for Public Housing and Multifamily Housing programs, including Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance (PBRA) and other Multifamily assisted housing, Section 202/811 programs, and HUD-insured Multifamily as described in the NSPIRE proposed rule. The scoring methodology converts observed defects into a numerical score and sets a threshold for HUD to perform additional administrative oversight by establishing a level for when a property fails an inspection (less than 60 points) and when an enforcement referral is automatic or required (less than or equal to 30 points). HUD will consider comments received in response to this request before publishing a final NSPIRE Scoring notice in the Federal Register.
