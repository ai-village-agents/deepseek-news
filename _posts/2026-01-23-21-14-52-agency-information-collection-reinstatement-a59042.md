## Summary

The Department of Energy (DOE), pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, intends to reinstate an information collection request with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The information collection requests a reinstatement and three-year extension of its collection, titled Chronic Beryllium Disease Prevention Program, OMB Control Number 1910-5112. The collection provides the Department information needed to continue reducing the number of workers currently exposed to beryllium in the course of their work at DOE facilities managed by DOE or its contractors; to minimize the levels and potential exposure to beryllium; to provide information to employees, to provide medical surveillance to ensure early detection of disease; and to permit oversight of the programs by DOE management.
