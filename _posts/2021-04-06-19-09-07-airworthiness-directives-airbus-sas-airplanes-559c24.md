## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-01- 10, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 airplanes. AD 2020-01-10 required installing flight control and guidance system (FCGS) software (SW) X11 Standard (STD). This AD retains the requirements of AD 2020-01-10, requires modifying the electrical power supply of the air generation system (AGS) ram air outlet door actuators, and expands the applicability by adding airplanes, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD was prompted by the development of a modification that forces the AGS ram air outlet doors to be flush in cases of total engine flameout or loss of the main electrical supply. Because of this additional modification, certain airplanes that were excluded from the applicability of AD 2020-01-10 are included in the applicability of this AD. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
