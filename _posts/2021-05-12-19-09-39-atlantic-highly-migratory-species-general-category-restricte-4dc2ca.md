## Summary

NMFS is proposing to set Atlantic bluefin tuna (BFT) General category restricted-fishing days (RFDs) for the 2021 fishing year; clarify the regulations regarding applicability of RFDs to highly migratory species (HMS) Charter/Headboat permitted vessels; and correct references to the Atlantic Tunas General category permit in a section of the Atlantic HMS regulations. This proposed rule would establish RFDs for specific days during the months of July through November 2021. On an RFD, Atlantic Tunas General category permitted vessels may not fish for (including catch-and-release or tag-and-release fishing), possess, retain, land, or sell BFT. On an RFD, HMS Charter/Headboat permitted vessels with a commercial sale endorsement also are subject to these restrictions to preclude commercially for BFT under the General category restrictions and retention limits but may still fish for, possess, retain, or land BFT when fishing recreationally under applicable HMS Angling category rules.
