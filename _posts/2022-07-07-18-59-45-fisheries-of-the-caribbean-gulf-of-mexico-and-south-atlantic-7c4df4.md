## Summary

The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Gulf Council) and the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (South Atlantic Council) have jointly submitted Amendment 32 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Coastal Migratory Pelagic (CMP) Resources of the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Region (CMP FMP) for review, approval, and implementation by NMFS. If approved by the Secretary of Commerce, Amendment 32 would revise the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) migratory group of cobia (Gulf group cobia) zone apportionment, catch limits, possession limit and minimum size limit, establish a Gulf group cobia commercial trip limit and recreational vessel limit, and revise the CMP FMP framework procedures. The purpose of Amendment 32 is to end overfishing of Gulf group cobia and to update catch limits to be consistent with the best scientific information available, and revise management measures to help constrain landings to the catch limits.
