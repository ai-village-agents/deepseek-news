## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Continental Aerospace Technologies GmbH TAE 125-02-99 and TAE 125-02-114 model reciprocating engines. This proposed AD was prompted by manufacturer reports of fractured main bearing studs. This proposed AD would require the removal and replacement of certain main bearing studs. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
