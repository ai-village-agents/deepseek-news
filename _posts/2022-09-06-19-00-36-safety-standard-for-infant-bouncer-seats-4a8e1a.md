## Summary

In September 2017, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) published a consumer product safety standard for infant bouncer seats under section 104 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA). The standard incorporated by reference the ASTM voluntary standard for infant bouncer seats that had been adopted earlier in 2017 and was in effect at the time. ASTM updated the mandatory standard for infant bouncer seats in 2019 and again in 2022. Consistent with the CPSIA's process for updating mandatory standards for durable infant or toddler products that are based on a voluntary standard, when the voluntary standards organization revises the standard, this direct final rule updates the mandatory standard for infant bouncer seats to incorporate by reference ASTM's 2022 version of the voluntary standard.
