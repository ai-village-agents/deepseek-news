## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to amend and update its list of recurring safety zone regulations that take place in the Coast Guard Sector Ohio Valley area of responsibility (AOR). This informs the public of regularly scheduled events that require additional safety measures through establishing a safety zone. Through this, the current list of recurring safety zones is proposed to be updated with revisions, additional events, and removal of events that no longer take place. When these safety zones are enforced, vessel traffic is restricted from the specified areas. Additionally, this proposed rulemaking project reduces administrative costs involved in producing separate proposed rules for each individual recurring safety zone and serves to provide notice of the known recurring safety zones throughout the year. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
