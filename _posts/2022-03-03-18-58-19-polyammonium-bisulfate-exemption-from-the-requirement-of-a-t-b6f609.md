## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of Polyammonium bisulfate (PABS) (CAS Reg. No. 10043-02-4), herein referred to as PABS, when used as an inert ingredient (carrier, adjuvant, buffer and stabilizer) in/on growing crops and raw agricultural commodities pre- and post-harvest, limited to 40% in pesticide non-residential formulations and 5% in pesticide formulations for residential use. An exemption is also established for its use in antimicrobial formulations applied to food-contact surfaces in public eating places, dairy-processing equipment, food-processing equipment and utensils, limited to 250 parts per million (ppm). Spring Regulatory Sciences on behalf of Earth Science Laboratories, Inc., submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting the establishment of exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of PABS.
