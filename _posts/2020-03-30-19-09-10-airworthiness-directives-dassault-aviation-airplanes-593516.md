## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-19-27 and AD 2014-16-12, which applied to certain Dassault Aviation Model FALCON 2000EX airplanes. AD 2018-19-27 and AD 2014-16-12 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new maintenance requirements and airworthiness limitations. This AD retains those actions and requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate additional new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. This AD was prompted by the FAA's determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
