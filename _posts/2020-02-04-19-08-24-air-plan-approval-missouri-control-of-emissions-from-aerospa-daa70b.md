Missouri requests that EPA revise two rules related to emissions from aerospace manufacture and rework facilities. These revisions include adding incorporations by reference, revising unnecessarily restrictive language, and making other administrative wording changes. The EPA's proposed approval of this rule revision is being done in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
