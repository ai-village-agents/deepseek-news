## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice invites the general public and other public agencies to comment on this proposed information collection. This data collection is based on the currently approved 2023 Pulse Survey: Operational Challenges in Child Nutrition Program, OMB Control No. 0584-0689, expiration date 12/ 31/2026. This revised collection will be renamed the OMB Generic Clearance for the Annual Survey of School Food Authorities and will be reclassified as a generic clearance to more accurately reflect the process under which FNS has submitted and OIRA has cleared revised annual School Food Authority (SFA) survey instruments. The studies encompassed under this information collection will collect data from SFAs administering the Child Nutrition Programs, including information on emerging and ongoing challenges, their impacts on operations and student participation, and strategies SFAs are undertaking to address challenges they face.
