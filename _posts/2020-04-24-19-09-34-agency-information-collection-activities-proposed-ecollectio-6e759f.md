## Summary

The Department of Justice (DOJ), Community Relations Service (CRS), intends to request approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for a generic information collection clearance that will allow CRS to conduct a variety of participant feedback studies. CRS will submit the request for review and approval in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. Over the next three years, CRS anticipates collecting program impact evaluation data for reassessing ongoing programs across several areas within community outreach. The purpose of these collections is to gather feedback from participants who attended CRS programs and to use that information to measure the impact of the programs. This work may entail redesigning and/or modifying existing programs based upon received feedback. CRS envisions using surveys, interviews, and other electronic data collection instruments.
