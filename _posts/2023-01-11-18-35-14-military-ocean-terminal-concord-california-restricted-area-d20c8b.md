## Summary

The U.S. Army Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) requested that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) revise the restricted area boundaries for the Military Ocean Terminal Concord (MOTCO). The MOTCO restricted area is located along the south shore of Suisun Bay, north of the City of Concord, Contra Costa County, California. The request to revise the boundaries of the MOTCO restricted area is due to the need to provide a more sufficient security buffer distance in navigable waters next to critical MOTCO shoreline infrastructure.
