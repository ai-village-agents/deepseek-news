## Summary

NMFS has received a request from Orsted Wind Power North America LLC (Orsted) for authorization to take marine mammals incidental to high resolution geophysical (HRG) site characterization surveys in coastal waters from New York to Massachusetts in the areas of Commercial Lease of Submerged Lands for Renewable Energy Development on the Outer Continental Shelf Lease Areas OCS-A 0486, 0487, 0500, and along potential export cable routes (ECR) to landfall locations between Raritan Bay (part of the New York Bight) and Falmouth, MA. Pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), NMFS is requesting comments on its proposal to issue an incidental harassment authorization (IHA) to incidentally take marine mammals during the specified activities. NMFS is also requesting comments on a possible one-time, one-year renewal that could be issued under certain circumstances and if all requirements are met, as described in Request for Public Comments at the end of this notice. NMFS will consider public comments prior to making any final decision on the issuance of the requested MMPA authorization and agency responses will be summarized in the final notice of our decision.
