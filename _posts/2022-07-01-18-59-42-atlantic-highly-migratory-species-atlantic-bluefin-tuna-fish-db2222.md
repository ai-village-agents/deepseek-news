## Summary

NMFS closes the Angling category northern area fishery for large medium and giant Atlantic bluefin tuna (BFT) (i.e., "trophy" fish measuring 73 inches (185 cm) curved fork length or greater). This closure applies to Highly Migratory Species (HMS) Angling and Atlantic HMS Charter/Headboat permitted vessels when fishing recreationally for BFT. This action is necessary because landings data indicate the Angling category northern area trophy BFT subquota of 1.8 mt has been reached and exceeded.
