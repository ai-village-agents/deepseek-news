## Summary

The FDIC is finalizing revisions to its regulations relating to the brokered deposits and interest rate restrictions that apply to less than well capitalized insured depository institutions. For brokered deposits, the final rule establishes a new framework for analyzing certain provisions of the "deposit broker" definition, including "facilitating" and "primary purpose." For the interest rate restrictions, the FDIC is amending its methodology for calculating the national rate, the national rate cap, and the local market rate cap. Further, the FDIC is explaining when nonmaturity deposits are accepted and when nonmaturity deposits are solicited for purposes of applying the brokered deposits and interest rate restrictions.
