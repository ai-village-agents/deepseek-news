## Summary

The Maritime Administration (MARAD) invites public comments on our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for a currently approved emergency information collection. Before a Federal agency can collect certain information from the public, it must receive approval from OMB. Under procedures established by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, before seeking OMB approval, Federal agencies must solicit public comment on proposed collection of information, including extensions and reinstatements of previously approved collections. This document described a collection of information for which MARAD intends to seek OMB approval.
