## Summary

The Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (ASD(HA)) issues this notice of demonstration to authorize the Defense Health Agency (DHA) to expand the DoD and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Hearing Aid Program (HAP) utilized throughout the Military Health System to a limited segment of the private sector care network of the TRICARE Managed Care Support Contractors (MCSCs). The intent is to replicate, to the fullest extent possible, the VA's Community Care Network model for delivery of prescribed hearing aids and associated devices to Veterans, for Active Duty Service Members (ADSMs) receiving care through the Supplemental Health Care Program (SHCP) in designated states, as well as to qualifying Prime Active Duty Family Members (ADFMs) diagnosed with profound hearing loss. This demonstration will be effective for the period of two years and conducted in three tiered phases: Phase One covers ADSMs in the state of California from January 1, 2023 until the completion of the demonstration; Phase Two covers ADSMs in the state of Texas from January 1, 2024 until the completion of the demonstration; and Phase Three covers qualifying Prime ADFMs in the states of California and Texas from July 1, 2024 through completion of the demonstration. These changes are intended to standardize the hearing aid ordering process and reduce the cost variability for hearing aids and associated devices prescribed for treatment under TRICARE by private sector care providers in network.
