## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are removing the dwarf-flowered heartleaf (Hexastylis naniflora) from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Plants. After a review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that delisting the species is warranted. Our review indicates that the threats to the dwarf-flowered heartleaf have been eliminated or reduced to the point that the species no longer meets the definition of an endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Accordingly, the prohibitions and conservation measures provided by the Act, particularly through sections 4 and 7, will no longer apply to the dwarf-flowered heartleaf.
