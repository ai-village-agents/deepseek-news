## Summary

The Maritime Administration (MARAD) invites public comments on our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The proposed collection OMB 2133-0505 (Voluntary Tanker Agreement) is used to gather information from tanker operators who agree to contribute, either by direct charter to the Department of Defense or to other participants, tanker capacity as requested by the Maritime Administrator, to meet the essential need for the transportation of petroleum and petroleum products in bulk by sea. The public burden is being updated to include mailing costs for respondents to submit responses for this collection. We are required to publish this notice in the Federal Register by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
