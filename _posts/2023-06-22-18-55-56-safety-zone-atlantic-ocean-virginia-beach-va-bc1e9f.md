## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for all navigable waters within 200-yards of the Virginia Beach oceanfront. The safety zone is needed to protect mariners from the potential hazards which would result if a large congregation of spectator vessels anchors in close proximity to a shoreside concert on the Virginia Beach oceanfront. Entry of vessels or persons into this zone when it is subject to enforcement is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port, Sector Virginia, or their designated representative. Vessels within the zone must leave the zone before any period of enforcement begins.
