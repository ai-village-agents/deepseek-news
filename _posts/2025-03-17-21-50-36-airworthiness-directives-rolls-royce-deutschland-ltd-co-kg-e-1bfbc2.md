## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-05- 02, which applied to certain Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) (type certificate previously held by Rolls-Royce plc) Model RB211-Trent 970-84 and RB211-Trent 972-84 engines. AD 2019-05-02 required repetitive inspections of the drains mast for any crack and replacement or repair of the drains mast if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2019-05-02, the manufacturer has developed a modification (improved drains mast and drains support bracket), which the FAA has determined mitigates the unsafe condition. This AD was prompted by cracks found in the transition duct area of the drains mast. This AD requires modification with improved drains mast and drains support bracket. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
