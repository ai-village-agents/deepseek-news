# Washington Apricots; Termination of Marketing Order

## Summary

This proposed rule invites comments on a recommendation from the Washington Apricot Marketing Committee (Committee) to terminate the Federal marketing order regulating the handling of apricots grown in designated counties in Washington (Marketing Order No. 922). The Committee determined the marketing order is no longer necessary to maintain orderly marketing conditions and unanimously recommended its termination. Following the Committee's recommendation, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) suspended the remaining reporting and assessment collection requirements under the marketing order while it considered termination of the marketing order. After reviewing the Committee's recommendation and other information submitted, AMS determined that the marketing order no longer tends to effectuate the declared policy of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937. If implemented, this proposed rule would remove Marketing Order No. 922 from the Code of Federal Regulations.
