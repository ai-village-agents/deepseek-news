## Summary

MSHA proposes to revise requirements for the contents in mine ventilation plans to eliminate the authority given to the District Manager to require additional provisions. The current standard may violate statutory authority; the Appointments Clause, by vesting significant regulatory authority in District Managers; and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), by skipping notice and comment.
