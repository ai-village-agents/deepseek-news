## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) is approving an application from the State of West Virginia (the State) to revise the State's Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) section 1422 underground injection control (UIC) program to include Class VI injection well primary enforcement authority (primacy). This final rule allows the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (WVDEP) to issue UIC permits for geologic carbon sequestration facilities as Class VI wells and ensure compliance of Class VI wells under the UIC program. The EPA will remain the permitting authority for all well classes in Indian lands within the State and will also oversee West Virginia's administration of its UIC Class VI program as authorized under SDWA.
