## Summary

NMFS is implementing a 2,000-lb (907.2-kg) possession limit for Atlantic herring for Management Area 1B. This is required because NMFS projects that herring catch from Area 1B will reach 92 percent of the Area's current sub-annual catch limit before the end of the fishing year. This action is intended to prevent overharvest of herring in Area 1B, which would result in additional catch limit reductions in a subsequent year.
