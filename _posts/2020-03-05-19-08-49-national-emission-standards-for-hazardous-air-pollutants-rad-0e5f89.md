## Summary

Pursuant to section 112 of the Clean Air Act, as amended, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is announcing the availability of Version 4.1 of the CAP88-PC model. This version may be used to demonstrate compliance with the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) applicable to radionuclides. CAP88- PC is approved for this use by the EPA. Version 4.1 includes a number of improvements from previous versions, including Version 4.0. The most significant of these changes from a user perspective are the implementation of a new Wix installer technology that enhances compatibility with Windows 10 and future Windows updates, an update in the number of included radionuclides and the data for these radionuclides, and a change in the manner in which reports are printed.
