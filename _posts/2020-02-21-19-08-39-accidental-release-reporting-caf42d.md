## Summary

The enabling statute of the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) provides that the CSB shall establish by regulation requirements binding on persons for reporting accidental releases into the ambient air subject to the Board's investigative jurisdiction. The final rule is intended to satisfy this statutory requirement. The rule describes when an owner or operator is required to file a report of an accidental release, and the required content of such a report. The purpose of the rule is to ensure that the CSB receives rapid, accurate reports of any accidental release that meets established statutory criteria.
