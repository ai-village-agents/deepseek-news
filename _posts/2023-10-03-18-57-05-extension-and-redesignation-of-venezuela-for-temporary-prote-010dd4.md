## Summary

Through this notice, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announces that the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) is extending the designation of Venezuela for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 18 months, beginning on March 11, 2024 and ending on September 10, 2025. This extension allows existing TPS beneficiaries to retain TPS through September 10, 2025, if they otherwise continue to meet the eligibility requirements for TPS. Existing TPS beneficiaries who wish to extend their status through September 10, 2025, must re- register during the re-registration period described in this notice. Separately, the Secretary is also redesignating Venezuela for TPS. The redesignation of Venezuela allows additional Venezuelan nationals (and individuals having no nationality who last habitually resided in Venezuela) who have been continuously residing in the United States since July 31, 2023, to apply for TPS for the first time during the initial registration period described under the redesignation information in this notice. In addition to demonstrating continuous residence in the United States since July 31, 2023, and meeting other eligibility criteria, initial applicants for TPS under this designation must demonstrate that they have been continuously physically present in the United States since October 3, 2023, the effective date of this redesignation of Venezuela for TPS. The Secretary's actions represent two distinct TPS designations of Venezuela--the first designation of Venezuela that was announced on March 9, 2021 (Venezuela 2021) and is being extended in this FRN, and this second action, redesignating Venezuela on October 3, 2023 (Venezuela 2023).
