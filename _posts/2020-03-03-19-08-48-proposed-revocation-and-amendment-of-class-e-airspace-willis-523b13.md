## Summary

This action proposes to revoke the Class E airspace at Sloulin Field International Airport, Williston, ND, due to the airport's closure. This action also proposes to amend Class E airspace at Williston Basin International Airport, Williston, ND. The action proposes to add an area designated as a surface area. This action also proposes to amend the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface by adding two extensions, one to the southeast and one to the north of the airport. Additionally, this action proposes to add a Class E airspace area extending upward from 1,200 feet above the surface. Lastly, this action proposes an administrative correction to the airspace legal description's text header by updating the airport's geographic coordinate to match the FAA's aeronautical database. These changes are necessary to accommodate airspace redesign for the safety and management of Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operations at the airport.
