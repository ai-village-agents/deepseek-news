## Summary

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended (EPCA), directs the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to initiate two rulemaking cycles for general service lamps (GSLs) that, among other requirements, determine whether standards in effect for GSLs should be amended. EPCA also requires DOE to periodically determine whether more-stringent, standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would result in significant energy savings. In this notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR), DOE proposes amended standards for GSLs pursuant to its statutory authority in EPCA, and also announces a webinar to receive comments on its proposal and associated analyses and results.
