## Summary

In this document, the Media Bureau of the Federal Communications Commission commences a hearing proceeding to determine, among other things, if the named licensee, Jennifer Juarez, and Antonio Cesar Guel, former licensee through his ownership of Hispanic Christian Community Network, Inc. (HCCN): lacked candor and misrepresented material facts to the Commission; abused FCC processes by engaging in a sham assignment of stations that apparently allowed Guel's improper and continued control of them; possess the requisite character qualifications to be a Commission licensee and, as a result, whether the stations' renewal applications should be denied/dismissed and the stations cancelled or revoked, whether to impose forfeitures against the parties, and whether to issue an order directing Guel/HCCN to cease and desist from violating provisions of Commission rules and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.
