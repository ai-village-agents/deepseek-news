## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is issuing this notice to request that public stakeholders notify FDA of their intent to participate in periodic consultation meetings on reauthorization of the Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act (AGDUFA). The statutory authority for AGDUFA expires September 30, 2023. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) requires that FDA consult with a range of stakeholders--including patient and consumer advocacy groups, veterinary professionals, and scientific and academic experts--in developing recommendations for the next AGDUFA program and hold discussions with these stakeholders at least once every 4 months during FDA's negotiations with the regulated industry. The purpose of this request for notification is to ensure consistent stakeholder representation at the consultation meetings.
