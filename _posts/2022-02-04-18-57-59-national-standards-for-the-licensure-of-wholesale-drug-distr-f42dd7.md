## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is proposing national standards for the licensing of prescription drug wholesale distributors ("wholesale distributors" or "wholesale drug distributors") and third-party logistics providers ("3PLs"), as directed under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) (Title II of the Drug Quality and Security Act). Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), as amended by the DSCSA, the proposed rule would establish standards for all State and Federal licenses issued.
