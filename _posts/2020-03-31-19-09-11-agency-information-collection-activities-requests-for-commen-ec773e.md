## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The reporting and recordkeeping requirements of this collection are related to FAA rules governing the operation of aircraft (other than moored balloons, kites, rockets, unmanned free balloons, and small unmanned aircraft) within the United States. These reporting and recordkeeping requirements are necessary for the FAA to assure compliance with these provisions.
