## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of New Hampshire on March 11, 2019. This revision establishes sulfur content limitations for fuels. In addition, the State requests withdrawal from the SIP of the existing sulfur limitations regulation, which will be superseded if and when EPA takes final action on the State's revised sulfur limitations regulation. The intended effect of this action is to propose approval of the State's March 11, 2019 submittal into the New Hampshire SIP. This action is being taken under the Clean Air Act.
