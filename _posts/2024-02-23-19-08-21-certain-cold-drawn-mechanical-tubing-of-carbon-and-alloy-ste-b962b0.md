## Summary

As a result of the determinations by the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) orders on certain cold- drawn mechanical tubing of carbon and alloy steel (cold-drawn mechanical tubing) from the Federal Republic of Germany (Germany), India, Italy, the People's Republic of China (China), the Republic of Korea (Korea), and Switzerland, and the countervailing duty (CVD) orders on cold-drawn mechanical tubing from India and China would likely lead to a continuation or recurrence of dumping, countervailable subsidies, and material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation of these AD and CVD orders.
