## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Thales AVS France SAS (Thales) Global Positioning System/ Satellite Based Augmentation System (GPS/SBAS) receivers installed on airplanes and helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by reports that Thales GPS/SBAS receivers provided, under certain conditions, erroneous outputs on aircraft positions. This proposed AD would require the installation of a software update to the aircraft navigation database and insertion of a change to the applicable airplane flight manual (AFM). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
