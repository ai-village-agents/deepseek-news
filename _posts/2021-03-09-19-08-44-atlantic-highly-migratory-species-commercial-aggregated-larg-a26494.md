## Summary

NMFS is closing the commercial fishery for the aggregated large coastal sharks (LCS) and hammerhead shark management groups in the western Gulf of Mexico sub-region. This action is necessary because the commercial landings of sharks in the aggregated LCS management group in the western Gulf of Mexico sub-region for the 2021 fishing season have reached 80 percent of the available commercial quota, and the aggregated LCS and hammerhead shark management groups quotas are linked under the regulations. This closure will affect anyone commercially fishing for sharks in the western Gulf of Mexico sub- region.
