## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-17-05, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. AD 2018-17-05 requires a check of the insulation resistance of the direct drive solenoid valve (DDSOV) of each affected electro- hydrostatic actuator (EHA) and applicable corrective actions. Since the FAA issued AD 2018-17-05, it has been determined that certain EHA part numbers can be modified and re-identified as specified in European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD 2019-0301, dated December 12, 2019, which would inadvertently remove certain part numbers from the applicability in other EHA-related ADs. This proposed AD would require a check of the insulation resistance of the DDSOV of each affected EHA and applicable corrective actions, and modifying or replacing certain EHAs, as specified in two EASA ADs, which will be incorporated by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
