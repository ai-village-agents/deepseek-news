## Summary

This rule adopts as final adjustments to the Schedule of Fees for Consular Services (Schedule of Fees) for several nonimmigrant visa (NIV) application processing fees and the Border Crossing Card (BCC) for Mexican citizens age 15 and over. These adjustments are based on the findings of the most recently approved update to the Cost of Service Model (CoSM) and incorporate revised projections for nonimmigrant visa demand. This rule also addresses public comments received by the Department on the originally proposed fee recommendations found in the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).
