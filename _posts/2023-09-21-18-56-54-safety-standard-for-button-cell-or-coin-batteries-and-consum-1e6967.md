## Summary

In February 2023, as required by Reese's Law, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) to establish performance and labeling requirements for consumer products containing button cell or coin batteries, and requirements for labeling of button cell or coin battery packages, to eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury from ingestion of button cell or coin batteries by children six years old and younger. Elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, the Commission is publishing a direct final rule to incorporate by reference a voluntary standard as the mandatory standard for consumer products containing button cell or coin batteries. The Commission issues this final rule to complete Reese's Law requirements for warning labels on the packaging of button cell or coin batteries. Button cell or coin battery packaging subject to this final rule must be certified as compliant with these warning label requirements.
