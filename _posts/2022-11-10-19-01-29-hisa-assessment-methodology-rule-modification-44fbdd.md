## Summary

The Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act of 2020 recognizes a self-regulatory nonprofit organization, the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority, which is charged with developing proposed rules on a variety of subjects. Those proposed rules and proposed rule modifications take effect only if approved by the Federal Trade Commission. The proposed rules and rule modifications must be published in the Federal Register for public comment. Thereafter, the Commission has 60 days from the date of publication to approve or disapprove the proposed rule or rule modification. The Authority submitted to the Commission a proposed rule modification on Assessment Methodology on October 20, 2022. The Office of the Secretary of the Commission determined that the proposal complied with the Commission's rule governing such submissions. This document publicizes the Authority's proposed rule modification's text and explanation, and it seeks public comment on whether the Commission should approve or disapprove the proposed rule modification.
