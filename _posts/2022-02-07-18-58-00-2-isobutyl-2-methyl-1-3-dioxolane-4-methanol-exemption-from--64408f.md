## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of 2-isobutyl-2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane-4- methanol (CAS Reg. No. 5660-53-7) when used as an inert ingredient (solvent/cosolvent) on growing crops and raw agricultural commodities after harvest, and in antimicrobial formulations applied to food- contact surfaces in public eating places, dairy-processing equipment, and food-processing equipment and utensils. SciReg, Inc., on behalf of Solvay USA Inc., submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of 2-isobutyl-2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane-4-methanol, when used in accordance with the terms of those exemptions.
