## Summary

NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Pacific cod by American Fisheries Act (AFA) trawl catcher/processors in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the annual 2025 Pacific cod total allowable catch (TAC) allocated to AFA trawl catcher/processors in the BSAI.
