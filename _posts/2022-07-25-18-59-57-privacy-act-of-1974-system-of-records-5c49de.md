## Summary

HUD Emergency Operations Center, Office of Disaster Management and National Security proposes to add a new system of records entitled, "Emergency Notification System". The purpose of this system is to maintain emergency contact information for HUD personnel to enable emergency notifications involving an immediate threat to health or safety of HUD employees. The system provides for high-speed message delivery that reaches all HUD personnel across all available communication channels to deliver alerts and notifications issued by the Department of Homeland Security, other Federal Operations Centers, and/or local emergency officials regarding weather related emergencies, national security incidents, or other critical situations that disrupt the operations and accessibility of a worksite. The system will also enable the Department to account for the safety of HUD personnel during an emergency or incident.
