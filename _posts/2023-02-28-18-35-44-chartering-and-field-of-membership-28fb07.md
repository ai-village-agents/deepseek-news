## Summary

The NCUA Board (Board) is proposing to amend its chartering and field of membership (FOM) rules with respect to the provision of financial services to low- and moderate-income communities and expanding access to safe, fair, and affordable financial services and products generally. The Board is also proposing several changes to the FOM rules to streamline application requirements and clarify procedures. These proposed amendments result from the agency's experience in addressing FOM issues relating to community charters and service to underserved areas, along with its study of FOM issues in the Board's Advancing Communities through Credit, Education, Stability, and Support (ACCESS) initiative. The Board is also requesting feedback about several aspects of FOM issues for consideration with respect to future policy refinements. Due to the scope and complexity of both the proposed changes and the additional issues presented for feedback, the Board is providing a 90- day comment period. Consistent with the guidance the NCUA provided in Interpretative Ruling and Policy Statement 87-2 (NCUA IRPS 87-2-- Developing and Reviewing Government Regulations) the Board is extending the comment period beyond the typical 60 days because it believes it will benefit from an additional opportunity for public input on these issues.
