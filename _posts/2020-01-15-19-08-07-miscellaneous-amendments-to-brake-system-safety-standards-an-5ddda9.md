## Summary

FRA is proposing to revise its regulations governing brake inspections, tests, and equipment. The proposed changes include the incorporation of relief from various provisions provided in long- standing waivers related to single car air brake tests, end-of train devices, helper service, and brake maintenance. FRA is also proposing to extend the time that freight rail equipment can be "off-air" before requiring a new brake inspection. In addition, FRA is proposing various modifications to the existing brake related regulations for clarity and to remove outdated or unnecessary provisions. The proposed revisions would benefit railroads and the public by reducing unnecessary costs, creating consistency between U.S. and Canadian regulations, and incorporating the use of newer technologies demonstrated to maintain or increase safety. The proposed rule would reduce the overall regulatory burden on railroads.
