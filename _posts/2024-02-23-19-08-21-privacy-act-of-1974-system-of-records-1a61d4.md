## Summary

In accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is rescinding a system of records titled "Administration: Senior Staff, HHS/NIH/NIAID," system number 09-25-0087. The records are no longer needed for agency business, so are no longer retrieved by names or other personal identifiers. Because of this, the records no longer qualify as a Privacy Act system of records, and it is appropriate to rescind the system of records.
