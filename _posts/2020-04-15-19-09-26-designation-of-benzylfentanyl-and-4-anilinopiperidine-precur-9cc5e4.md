## Summary

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is finalizing the designation of N-(1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)-N-phenylpropionamide (also known as benzylfentanyl), including its salts, and N-phenylpiperidin-4- amine (also known as 4-anilinopiperidine; N-phenyl-4-piperidinamine; 4- AP) (hereinafter referred to as 4-anilinopiperidine), including its amides, its carbamates, and its salts, as list I chemicals under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). DEA proposed control of benzylfentanyl and 4-anilinopiperidine due to their use in clandestine laboratories to illicitly manufacture the schedule II controlled substance fentanyl. This rulemaking finalizes the control of benzylfentanyl and 4- anilinopiperidine as list I chemicals.
