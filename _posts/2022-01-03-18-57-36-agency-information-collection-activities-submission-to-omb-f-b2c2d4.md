## Summary

HRSA, a sub-agency of the Department of Health and Human Services, is announcing a change in the NPDB Basis for Action Code Lists for Federal Licensure, and State Licensure or Certification Actions to individuals and entities authorized to report and request information from the NPDB. These changes will contain updated codes and code use guidance applicable to organizations submitting Federal Licensure, or State Licensure or Certification Actions. The code modifications and guidance are intended to provide improved report accuracy and promote a better understanding of the use and application of the basis of action codes available for report submission. The modifications are based in part upon recommendations made through a collaborative effort with NPDB industry partners: the Federation of State Boards of Physical Therapy, the National Council of State Boards of Nursing, the Federation of State Medical Boards, the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards, the National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy, the Association of Social Work Boards, and the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy. Basis for Action codes help to accurately describe the basis for licensure actions reported. Basis for Action codes have no impact on the licensure action reported or the applicability of NPDB reporting criteria. New, modified, and retired codes have no impact on historical reporting. The coding of previously submitted reports will remain unchanged.
