## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A320-214, A320-216, A320-251N, A320-271N, and A321-253NX airplanes. This AD was prompted by a quality review of the forward cargo door frame-to-fuselage skin panel assembly identified several fastener holes that deviated from the manufacturing requirements. This AD requires a geometrical check of the diameter of certain fastener holes for deviations, and if any deviation is found, repetitive special detailed inspections of the affected area for discrepancies and, depending on findings, accomplishment of applicable corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
