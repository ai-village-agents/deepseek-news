## Summary

We are advising the public that we added Gabon, Guinea, and Moldova to the list of regions that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service considers to be affected with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). These actions follow our imposition of HPAI- related restrictions on the importation of avian commodities originating from or transiting Gabon, Guinea, and Moldova as a result of the confirmation of HPAI in Gabon and Guinea, and reports of HPAI from the veterinary authorities of Moldova in the country.
