## Summary

Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on January 3, 2025, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of Razor USA LLC of Cerritos, California and Shane Chen of Camas, Washington. An amended complaint was filed on January 21, 2025. The complaint, as amended, alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain motorized self-balancing vehicles by reason of the infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. RE46,964 ("the '964 patent"), U.S. Patent No. RE49,608 ("the '608 patent"), and U.S. Patent No. D739,906 ("the '906 patent"). The complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists or is in the process of being established as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The complainants request that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a limited exclusion order and cease and desist orders.
