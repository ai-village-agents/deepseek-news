## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Piper Aircraft, Inc. (Piper) Model PA-46-600TP airplanes. This AD was prompted by testing that showed that the wing splice assembly could fail before the assembly reaches its established life limit. This AD requires revising the Airworthiness Limitations section (ALS) of the existing maintenance manual (MM) or instructions for continued airworthiness (ICA) to reduce the life limit of the wing splice assembly. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
