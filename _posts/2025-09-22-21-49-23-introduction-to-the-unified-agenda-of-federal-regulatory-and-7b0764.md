## Summary

Publication of the Spring 2025 Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions represents a key component of the regulatory planning mechanism prescribed in Executive Order ("E.O.") 12866, "Regulatory Planning and Review," (58 FR 51735, as amended) and reaffirmed in E.O. 13563, "Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review," (76 FR 3821) and E.O. 14192, "Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation." The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires that agencies publish semiannual regulatory agendas in the Federal Register describing regulatory actions they are developing that may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (5 U.S.C. 602). The Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions (Unified Agenda), published in the fall and spring, helps agencies fulfill all of these requirements. All Federal regulatory agencies have chosen to publish their regulatory agendas as part of this publication. The complete publication of the Spring 2025 Unified Agenda contains 69 Federal agency regulatory agendas available to the public at www.reginfo.gov. The Spring 2025 Unified Agenda publication appearing in the Federal Register includes the agency Regulatory Flexibility Agendas, in accordance with the publication requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Agency Regulatory Flexibility Agendas contain only those Agenda entries for rules that are likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and entries that have been selected for periodic review under section 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
