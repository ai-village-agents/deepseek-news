## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for MD Helicopters Inc. (MDHI) Model 600N helicopters. This AD requires establishing a life limit for the main rotor (M/R) blade upper control collective/longitudinal link assembly (link assembly). This AD was prompted by the discovery that the life limit was omitted from the maintenance manual. The actions of this AD are intended to prevent an unsafe condition on these products.
