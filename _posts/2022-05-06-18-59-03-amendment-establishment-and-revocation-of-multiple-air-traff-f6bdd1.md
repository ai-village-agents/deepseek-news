## Summary

This action amends Jet Route J-8 and VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airway V-272; establishes Area Navigation (RNAV) route T- 420; and removes Jet Route J-142 and VOR Federal airways V-304 and V- 390. The FAA is taking this action due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Borger, TX, VOR/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) navigational aid (NAVAID). The Borger VOR is being decommissioned in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
