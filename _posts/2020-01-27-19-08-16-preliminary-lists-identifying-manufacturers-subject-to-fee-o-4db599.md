## Summary

As required by EPA's Final Rule on Fees for the Administration of TSCA (the Fees Rule), in which EPA established fees to defray some of the costs of administering certain provisions of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), this Notice identifies the preliminary lists of manufacturers (including importers) of 20 chemical substances that have been designated as a High-Priority Substance for risk evaluation and for which fees will be charged. EPA is providing a 60- day comment period during which manufacturers (including importers) are required to self-identify as a manufacturer of a High-Priority Substance irrespective of whether they are included on the preliminary lists. Where appropriate, entities may also avoid or reduce fee obligations by making certain certifications consistent with the Fees Rule. During this 60-day comment period, the public will have the opportunity to correct errors or provide comments on the preliminary lists. EPA expects to publish final lists of manufacturers (including importers) subject to fees no later than concurrently with the publication of the final scope document for risk evaluations of these 20 High-Priority Substances. Manufacturers (including importers) identified on the final lists will be subject to applicable fees.
