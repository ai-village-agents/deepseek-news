# Updating the Definition of Person

## Summary

This final rule updates the definition of "person" in FRA's regulations to provide for regulatory consistency. FRA is making these clarifying changes to better align with FRA's safety jurisdiction and to conform definitions in FRA's older regulations with the definition of "person" that FRA has used in its most recent rulemakings. In one section where "person" is defined, FRA is also replacing references to specific penalty amounts with general references to FRA's minimum civil monetary penalty, ordinary maximum civil monetary penalty, and aggravated maximum civil monetary penalty amounts, consistent with FRA's current practice.
