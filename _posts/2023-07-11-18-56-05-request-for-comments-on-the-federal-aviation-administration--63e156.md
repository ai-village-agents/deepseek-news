## Summary

On May 1, 2023, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published a Request for comments seeking input on its review of four key considerations of its civil aviation noise policy, in the context of noise metrics and noise thresholds. The civil aviation noise policy sets forth how the FAA analyzes, explains, and publicly presents changes in noise exposure from aviation activity. The comment period for the request for comments was scheduled to end on July 31, 2023. FAA received several requests to extend the comment period. The FAA is extending the comment period for the request for comments by 60 days.
