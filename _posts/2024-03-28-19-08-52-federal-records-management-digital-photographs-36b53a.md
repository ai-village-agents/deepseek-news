# Federal Records Management: Digital Photographs

## Summary

The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is removing provisions in established regulations that cover special concerns for digital photographs. This revision is necessary because recent amendments create new and more specific requirements for digitizing permanent photographic prints. The recent amendments do not address digitized negatives and slides, therefore requirements for managing these formats have been revised and retained in the existing regulations.
