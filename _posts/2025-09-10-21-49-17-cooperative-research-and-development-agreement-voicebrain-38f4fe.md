## Summary

The Coast Guard is announcing its intent to enter into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with VoiceBrain to determine the efficacy of artificial intelligence multicast overlays into operational communication platforms currently in use by the Coast Guard. While the Coast Guard is currently considering partnering with VoiceBrain, we are soliciting public comment on the possible nature of and participation of other parties in the proposed CRADA. In addition, the Coast Guard also invites other potential Federal participants, who have the interest and capability to bring similar contributions to this type of research, to consider submitting proposals for consideration in similar CRADAs.
