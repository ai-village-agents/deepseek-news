## Summary

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is revising its regulations to incorporate by reference, with certain enumerated exceptions, the latest version (Version 003.2) of the Standards for Business Practices and Communication Protocols for Public Utilities adopted by the Wholesale Electric Quadrant (WEQ) of the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) as mandatory enforceable requirements. The Commission is adopting this latest version instead of WEQ Version 003.1, which was the subject of an earlier notice of proposed rulemaking. The Commission declines to adopt the proposal to remove the incorporation by reference of the WEQ-006 Manual Time Error Correction Business Practice Standards as adopted by NAESB.
