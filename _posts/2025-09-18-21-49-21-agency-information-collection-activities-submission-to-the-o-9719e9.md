## Summary

In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), this notice announces that the Information Collection Request (ICR) abstracted below will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected burden. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) intends to conduct a new information collection for a National Roadside Survey (NRS) of alcohol and other drug prevalence among drivers and other road users (ORUs; e.g., pedestrians, bicyclists, electric scooter riders, and those with mobility aids). NHTSA will conduct two studies. Study 1 will focus on drivers but include convenience sampling of ORUs passing by the driver data collection locations. Study 2 is a pilot test assessing the feasibility of an NRS specific to ORUs. Both will collect breath and oral fluid specimens, demographic information, and self-report questionnaire data on roads across the country. Participation will be voluntary and anonymous. A Federal Register notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following information collection was published on November 20, 2024. NHTSA received 6 comments, which we address below.
