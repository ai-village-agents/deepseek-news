## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-18-14, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A330-200 series, A330-200 Freighter series, A330-300 series, A330-800 series, and A330- 900 series airplanes. AD 2022-18-14 requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-18-14, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2022-18-14, and would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate additional new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in two European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) ADs, which are proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
