## Summary

The United States Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers (USACE), has filed an application with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) requesting that the Secretary of the Interior extend Public Land Order (PLO) No. 7608 for an additional 20-year term. Subject to valid existing rights, PLO No. 7608 withdrew 400.27 acres of public lands from settlement, sale, location, or entry under the general land laws, including the United States mining laws, and transferred jurisdiction over those lands to the Department of the Army for the Chief Joseph Dam Additional Units Project for a period of 20 years. This notice advises the public of a 90-day opportunity to comment on the withdrawal extension application and to request a public meeting.
