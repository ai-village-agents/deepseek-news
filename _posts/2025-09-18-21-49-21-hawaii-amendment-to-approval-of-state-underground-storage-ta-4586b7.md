## Summary

On March 7, 2022, the State of Hawaii (Hawaii or State) received final approval, from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), of revisions to its Underground Storage Tank Program (UST Program) under subtitle I of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Pursuant to RCRA, the EPA is taking direct final action, subject to public comment, to amend its final approval of the UST Program. The amendment clarifies the statutory provisions that are part of the approved UST Program and identifies some additional statutory provisions that are broader in scope and not part of the approved UST Program. This action also codifies the EPA's approval of Hawaii's revised UST Program and incorporates by reference those provisions of the State statutes and regulations that the EPA has determined meet the requirements for approval.
