## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance entitled "Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER) Rat Bioassay Studies To Demonstrate That a New Infant Formula Supports the Quality Factor of Sufficient Biological Quality of Protein." The draft guidance, when finalized, will provide information for manufacturers and contract laboratories that perform PER studies to assist in designing, conducting, evaluating, and reporting PER studies. The draft guidance, when finalized, will explain "appropriate modifications" of AOAC Official Method 960.48 (the AOAC Method) with the aim of supporting industry in successfully conducting PER studies that demonstrate that a new infant formula meets the quality factor of sufficient biological quality of protein when fed as the sole source of nutrition.
