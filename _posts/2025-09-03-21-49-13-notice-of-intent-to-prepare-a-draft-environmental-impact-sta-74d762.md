## Summary

Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) will prepare a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to evaluate a range of alternatives for potential one-year water transfer activities subject to proposal, review, and approval on an annual basis (the "Proposed Action"). Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), San Luis & Delta-Mendota Water Authority (SLDMWA) will prepare a Draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR) on the same range of potential north-to-south water transfer activities (the "Project") concurrent with the EIS preparation. A joint EIS/EIR will be prepared to examine the effects of water transfers between willing buyers and sellers when circumstances allow. To afford an informational opportunity for comprehensive environmental review otherwise unavailable to the public, Reclamation's responsibilities are defined under Federal law and it is serving as the Lead Agency for the "Proposed Action" under NEPA and SLDMWA is the Lead Agency under CEQA for the "Project." Reclamation is requesting comments on alternatives and effects, as well as on relevant information, studies, or analyses with respect to the proposed action.
