## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 757 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of operators finding frequent and severe damage to the blowout vent grills of the aft soft bulkhead lining in the aft lower lobe cargo compartment. This proposed AD would require repetitive detailed inspections of certain decompression panels and pressure equalization valves, as applicable, in the forward and aft lower lobe cargo compartments for damage, and applicable on-condition actions. For certain airplanes, this proposed AD would also require replacement of a certain soft bulkhead with a rigid bulkhead. For certain other airplanes, this proposed AD would require installation of doublers to a certain bulkhead assembly panel. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
