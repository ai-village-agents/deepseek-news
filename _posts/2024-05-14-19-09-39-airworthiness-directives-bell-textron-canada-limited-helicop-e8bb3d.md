## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bell Textron Canada Limited Model 505 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a fuel leakage discovered during fuel system crash impact testing activity. This proposed AD would require installing a grommet around the sump drain port fitting airframe hole, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
