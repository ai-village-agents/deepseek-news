## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are reopening the comment period on our October 25, 2021, proposed rule to designate critical habitat for the coastal distinct population segment of Pacific marten (coastal marten) (Martes caurina), a mammal species from coastal California and Oregon, under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). This action will allow all interested parties an additional opportunity to comment on the October 25, 2021, proposed rule, as well as the opportunity to comment on the additional areas we are considering for exclusion from critical habitat designation, potential changes to Unit 1, and on new habitat modeling efforts for the coastal marten, as explained in this document. Comments previously submitted need not be resubmitted as they are already incorporated into the public record and will be fully considered in the final rule.
