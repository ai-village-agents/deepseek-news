## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to determine that the Sacramento Metro, California area attained the 2008 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) by its December 31, 2024 attainment date. This proposed determination is based on quality-assured and certified ambient air quality monitoring data from 2022 through 2024. If we finalize this determination as proposed, the requirement for the State to have contingency measures for reasonable further progress (RFP) and attainment for the 2008 ozone NAAQS will no longer apply for this area. We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action. Elsewhere in this Federal Register, we are making an interim final determination that will stay and defer the imposition of Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act") sanctions associated with a disapproval action related to the contingency measures requirement for this area.
