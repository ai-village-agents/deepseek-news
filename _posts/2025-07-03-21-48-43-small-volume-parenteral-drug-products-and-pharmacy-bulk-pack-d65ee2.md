## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled "Small Volume Parenteral Drug Products and Pharmacy Bulk Packages for Parenteral Nutrition: Aluminum Content and Labeling Recommendations." This draft guidance is intended to clarify the key factors in calculating the aluminum content to ensure that the total aluminum exposure in parenteral nutrition (PN) does not exceed an acceptable threshold. It also provides FDA's recommendations regarding the aluminum concentration limits for small volume parenterals (SVPs) packaged as single doses or SVPs packaged in pharmacy bulk packages (PBPs). Additionally, this draft guidance is intended to assist sponsors and applicants in determining the appropriate placement of information on aluminum toxicity in SVP and large volume parenteral (LVP) Prescribing Information and container and carton labeling. This draft guidance revises and replaces the draft guidance for industry of the same name published on December 7, 2022.
