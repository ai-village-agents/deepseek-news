## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled National Environmental Assessment Reporting System (NEARS). This system collects data from foodborne illness outbreak environmental assessments routinely conducted by local, state, territorial, or tribal food safety programs in health departments during foodborne outbreak investigations.
