## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a Clean Air Act (CAA) operating permit program revision submitted by the State of Maine. The revisions include minor changes to Maine's operating permit program that are considered clarifications, that correct grammar, that codify longstanding practices, or that are necessary to utilize an expected future electronic application system. The revisions also include provisions allowing the public comment period on a draft permit to run concurrently with EPA's review of a proposed permit. The intended effect of EPA's action is to propose approval of Maine's revisions. This action is being taken under the CAA.
