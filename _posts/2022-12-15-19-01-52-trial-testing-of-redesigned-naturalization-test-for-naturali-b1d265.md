## Summary

This notice announces that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will conduct a nationwide trial of planned changes to the naturalization test. The naturalization test is comprised of the civics test that evaluates a knowledge and understanding of the fundamentals of U.S. history and of the principles and form of U.S. government, as well as tests that evaluate an individual's understanding of the English language. USCIS will conduct a trial of both a standardized English-speaking test as part of the requirement to demonstrate an understanding of the English language and a civics test with updated content and format. The trial testing does not include the reading or writing portions of the test. USCIS will conduct the trial with volunteer community-based organizations (CBOs) that work with immigrant English language learners and lawful permanent residents (LPRs) preparing for naturalization. Participating in the trial is completely voluntary for organizations and students, and any test taken during, or as part of, the trial will not affect any naturalization application that may be submitted to USCIS during the trial testing period. USCIS may use the results to support changes to the naturalization test which USCIS would also announce through a different Federal Register notice.
