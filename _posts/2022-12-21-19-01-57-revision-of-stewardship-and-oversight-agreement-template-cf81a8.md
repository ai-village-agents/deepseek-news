## Summary

The FHWA has completed a revision to the Federal-State Stewardship and Oversight (S&O) Agreement template. The revised S&O Agreement template that is the subject of this notice is an updated version of a template issued by FHWA in 2015. The revisions address such issues as changes in applicable laws and the evolution of FHWA's risk-based stewardship and oversight program. The FHWA is requesting comments on the revised S&O Agreement template. The FHWA will publish a Federal Register notice announcing the final S&O Agreement template, including any changes FHWA makes in response to public comments.
