## Summary

This document invites comments from all stakeholders in connection with the development of an up-to-date record on the role of receivers in spectrum management and how the Federal Communications Commission (Commission or FCC) might best promote improvements in receiver interference immunity performance that would serve the public interest. The Commission seeks to build upon the progress, including technological advances, in recent years that has enabled better receiver interference immunity performance, and the Commission seeks comment on where those efforts and advances have been most successful. The Commission also seeks to learn lessons from recent Commission proceedings in which receiver performance concerns have been prominent, to better inform the Commission as it considers how to ensure valuable and innovative services are able to thrive across the frequency range.
