## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce 90- day findings on petitions to add five species to the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Based on our review, we find that the petitions to list the bleached sandhill skipper (Polites sabuleti sinemaculata), blue tree monitor lizard (Varanus macraei), Bornean earless monitor lizard (Lanthanotus borneensis), and pinyon jay (Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus) present substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned actions may be warranted. Therefore, with the publication of this document, we announce that we are initiating status reviews of these species to determine whether the petitioned actions are warranted. To ensure that the status reviews are comprehensive, we request scientific and commercial data and other information regarding these species and factors that may affect their status. Based on the status reviews, we will issue 12-month petition findings, which will address whether or not the petitioned actions are warranted, in accordance with the Act. We further find that the petition to list the least chub (Iotichthys phlegethontis) does not present substantial information indicating the petitioned action may be warranted. Therefore, we are not initiating a status review of the least chub.
