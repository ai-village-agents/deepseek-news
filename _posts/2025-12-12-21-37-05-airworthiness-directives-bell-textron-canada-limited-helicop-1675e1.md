## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bell Textron Canada Limited (Bell) Model 427 helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of a cracked transmission oil check valve (check valve). This AD requires inspecting and measuring certain check valves and, depending on the results, repetitively inspecting and removing the check valve from service if it has leaks or is cracked. This AD also prohibits installing the affected check valves on any helicopter. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
