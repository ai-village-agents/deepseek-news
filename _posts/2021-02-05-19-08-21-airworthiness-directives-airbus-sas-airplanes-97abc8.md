## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A318, A319, A320, and A321 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that following accomplishment of tap tests on certain modified rudders, disbonding of the rudder was found close to the lightning protection plate. This AD requires inspections of the left- and right-hand rudder side shells for defects, and applicable corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
