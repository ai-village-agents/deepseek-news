## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving delegation of authority to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio EPA) for implementing and enforcing the Federal plan requirements for municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills that commenced construction on or before July 17, 2014, and have not been modified or reconstructed since July 17, 2014. Additionally, Ohio EPA has requested to withdraw an existing MSW landfill State plan which will be replaced with the delegation of authority of the Federal plan. On June 12, 2025, the Ohio EPA Director signed a Memorandum of Agreement concerning the delegation of authority of the Federal plan to Ohio EPA by EPA. On June 24, 2025, the Memorandum of Agreement became effective upon the EPA Region 5 Regional Administrator's signature. The Federal plan addresses the implementation and enforcement of emission guidelines that impose emission limits and other control requirements on designated air pollutants from MSW landfills. This document informs the public of the Memorandum of Agreement, provides a copy of the signed document, and amends regulatory text in accordance with the Clean Air Act (CAA).
