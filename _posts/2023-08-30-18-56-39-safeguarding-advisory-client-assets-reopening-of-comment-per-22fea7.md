## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") is reopening the comment period for its proposal, Safeguarding Advisory Client Assets, Release No. IA-6240 (Feb. 15, 2023) ("Proposal"), which proposed a new rule under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Advisers Act" or "Act") that would redesignate and amend the current custody rule. In light of the adoption of the private fund adviser audit rule, which generally requires a registered investment adviser to obtain an annual financial statement audit of each private fund it advises in accordance with the audit provision of the current custody rule, reopening the comment period will allow interested persons additional time to assess the proposed amendments to the current custody rule's audit provision in light of the private fund adviser audit rule.
