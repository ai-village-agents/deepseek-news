## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to disapprove part of a Maryland state implementation plan (SIP) submission as inadequate to meet certain Clean Air Act (CAA) interstate transport requirements for the 2010 primary sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standard (SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS). Specifically, EPA proposes to find that the Maryland SIP submission does not contain adequate provisions prohibiting emissions from Maryland sources which will contribute significantly to nonattainment or interfere with maintenance of the 2010 SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS in any other state.
