## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Saab AB, Support and Services Model SAAB 2000 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a review of the anti-skid system that revealed the possibility of inadvertently connecting the inboard harness to the outboard channel (and vice versa) of the wheel speed transducers in the main landing gear (MLG) wheel axles. This AD requires installing color markings on the harnesses and the wheel axles, to ensure proper installation and connection of the anti-skid harnesses, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
