## Summary

On February 15, 2024, the Central Florida Rail Corridor (CFRC) submitted a request for amendment (RFA) to its FRA-certified positive train control (PTC) system in order to temporarily disable its PTC system between Milepost (MP) 749.60 and MP 755.4 to perform necessary maintenance and improve an existing a crossing. FRA published a notice inviting public comment on CFRC's request to disable its PTC system to perform necessary maintenance, with the initial comment period closing on March 18, 2024. This document provides the public with notice that FRA is extending the comment period on CFRC's request from March 18, 2024, to April 1, 2024, as CFRC's request was uploaded to the docket late due to a technical error, and was not available for review during the full initial comment period.
