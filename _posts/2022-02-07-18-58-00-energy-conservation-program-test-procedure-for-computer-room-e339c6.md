The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE or the Department) proposes to amend its test procedure for computer room air conditioners (CRACs) to incorporate by reference the latest draft version of the relevant industry consensus test standard. DOE also proposes to adopt the net sensible coefficient of performance (NSenCOP) metric in its test procedures for CRACs. Additionally, DOE proposes to amend certain provisions for representations and enforcement. DOE welcomes written comments from the public on any subject within the scope of this document (including topics not raised in this proposal), as well as the submission of data and other relevant information.
