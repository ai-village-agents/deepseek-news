## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for M7 Aerospace LLC Models SA26-AT and SA26-T airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of the airplane power lever linkage detaching from the TPE331 engine propeller pitch control (PPC) shaft. This AD requires repetitively inspecting the PPC for proper torque and making any necessary corrections until the replacement of the PPC assembly and the installation of a secondary retention feature (safety wire) are done. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
