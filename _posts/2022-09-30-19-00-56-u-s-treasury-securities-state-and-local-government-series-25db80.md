## Summary

The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) is issuing this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to amend the regulations governing State and Local Government Series (SLGS) securities. Treasury is proposing to amend the SLGS regulations to address misuse of the SLGS program, most notably the use of program flexibilities by tax- advantaged entities, usually a state or local government, investing in SLGS securities to create impermissible cost-free options. This NPRM proposes amendments to existing regulations to help stop such activity. In addition, this NPRM proposes administrative changes to increase efficiencies in the program.
