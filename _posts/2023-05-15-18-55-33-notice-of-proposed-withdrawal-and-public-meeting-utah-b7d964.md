## Summary

At the request of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Secretary of the Interior proposes to withdraw approximately 170,429 acres of public lands and interests in lands from all forms of entry, appropriation, and disposal under the public land laws; location and entry under the U.S. mining laws; operation of the mineral and geothermal leasing laws; and disposal under the mineral materials laws, subject to valid existing rights. The withdrawal is proposed for a period of five years to maintain the status quo while the Department of the Interior, the State of Utah, and the State of Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration (SITLA) consider a potential land exchange. Subject to valid existing rights, publication of this notice in the Federal Register segregates the lands for two years from the date of publication unless the segregative effect is terminated sooner. This notice also initiates a 90-day public comment period on the proposed withdrawal. A notice for public meeting(s) regarding the proposed withdrawal will be announced separately in the Federal Register, in at least one newspaper having general circulation, and on the agency website at least 30 days before the meeting(s).
