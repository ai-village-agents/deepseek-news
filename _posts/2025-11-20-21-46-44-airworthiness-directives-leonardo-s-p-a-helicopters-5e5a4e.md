## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2024-09- 02, which applies to all Leonardo S.p.a. Model AW169 helicopters. AD 2024-09-02 required replacing certain aft float assemblies or, as an alternative, deactivating the emergency flotation system (EFS). AD 2024-09-02 also prohibited the installation of certain forward and aft float assemblies. Since the FAA issued AD 2024-09-02, the FAA has determined that replacing additional forward and aft float assemblies is necessary. This AD retains all the actions of AD 2024-09-02 and also requires replacing certain forward and aft float assemblies within 24 months or during the next accomplishment of a certain maintenance task. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
