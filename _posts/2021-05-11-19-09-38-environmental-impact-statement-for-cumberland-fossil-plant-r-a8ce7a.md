## Summary

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) intends to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to assess the impacts associated with the proposed retirement of the two coal-fired units at the Cumberland Fossil Plant (CUF) and the construction and operation of facilities to replace part of the retired generation. TVA will use the EIS process to elicit and prioritize the values and concerns of stakeholders; formulate, evaluate and compare alternatives; provide opportunities for public review and comment; and ensure that TVA's evaluation of potential retirement and replacement energy generation reflects a full range of stakeholder input. Public comment is invited concerning the scope of the EIS, alternatives being considered, and environmental issues that should be addressed as a part of this EIS. TVA is also requesting data, information and analysis relevant to the proposed action from the public; affected Federal, State, tribal, and local governments, agencies, and offices; the scientific community; industry; or any other interested party.
