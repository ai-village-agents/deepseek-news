## Summary

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) intends to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for approximately 3,224 oil and gas leases sold in Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming and issued pursuant to 74 individual lease sale decisions. The EIS will provide a comprehensive analysis of the potential environmental impacts from these leases, which have been remanded to BLM for further review, including the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions (to include the social cost of carbon) and other common impacts.
