## Summary

We are reopening the comment period for our notice that proposes to add five new types of genetic modifications a plant can contain and be exempt from the regulations for the movement of organisms modified or produced through genetic engineering because such modifications could otherwise be achieved through conventional breeding methods. This action will allow interested persons additional time to prepare and submit comments.
