## Summary

NMFS implements an accountability measure for the commercial harvest of blueline tilefish in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the South Atlantic. NMFS estimates that commercial landings of blueline tilefish will soon reach the commercial annual catch limit (ACL) for the 2025 fishing year. Accordingly, NMFS closes the commercial sector for the harvest of blueline tilefish in the South Atlantic EEZ to protect the blueline tilefish resource from overfishing.
