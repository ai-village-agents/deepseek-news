# Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of undetected water leaks from the faucet control module (FCM) migrating below the passenger floor in multiple lavatory locations during flight, and into the electronic equipment bay(s). This proposed AD would require repetitive general visual inspections of the area under all lavatory washbasins for evidence of intermittent and active leaks at the FCM and applicable on- condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
