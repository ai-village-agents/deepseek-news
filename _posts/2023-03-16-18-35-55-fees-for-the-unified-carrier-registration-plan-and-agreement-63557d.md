## Summary

FMCSA is proposing to amend regulations for the annual registration fees States collect from motor carriers, motor private carriers of property, brokers, freight forwarders, and leasing companies for the Unified Carrier Registration (UCR) Plan and Agreement for the 2024 registration year and subsequent registration years. The fees for the 2024 registration year would be reduced below the fees for 2023 by approximately 9 percent overall, with varying reductions between $4 and $3,453 per entity, depending on the applicable fee bracket.
