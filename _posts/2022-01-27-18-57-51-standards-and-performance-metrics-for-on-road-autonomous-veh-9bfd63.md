## Summary

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will be hosting a virtual workshop on the development of Standards and Performance Metrics for On-Road Autonomous Vehicles on March 8-9, 2022. During this two-day event, attendees will have an opportunity to actively provide feedback in facilitated discussions regarding technical focus areas for NIST to develop standards, measurement science, and performance metrics for on-road autonomous vehicle technology. NIST will release a discussion draft that addresses the following technology areas: Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, Communication, Perception, Infrastructure, and Safety, prior to the workshop. NIST will use stakeholder feedback from the workshop to revise the discussion draft.
