## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve portions of two State implementation plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of California to meet Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements for the 2008 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or "standards") and the 2015 8-hour ozone NAAQS in the San Diego County ozone nonattainment area ("San Diego County area" or "area"). The first SIP revision, "2020 Plan for Attaining the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone in San Diego County" ("2020 San Diego County Ozone SIP" or "2020 Plan"), addresses most of the SIP requirements for the area. The second SIP revision, referred to as the "Smog Check Certification," supplements the motor vehicle inspection and maintenance program portion of the 2020 Plan. The EPA is taking final action to approve the 2020 Plan, and the San Diego County area portion of the Smog Check Certification, as meeting all the applicable ozone nonattainment area requirements for the 2008 and 2015 8-hour ozone NAAQS addressed by the plan except for the emissions statement requirement that the EPA previously found to have been met and the contingency measure requirements, for which the EPA is deferring action.
