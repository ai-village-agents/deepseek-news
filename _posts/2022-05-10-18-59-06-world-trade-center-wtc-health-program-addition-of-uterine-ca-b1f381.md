## Summary

Title I of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 amended the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) to establish the World Trade Center (WTC) Health Program. The WTC Health Program (Program), which is administered by the Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), within CDC, provides medical monitoring and treatment to eligible responders to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York City, at the Pentagon, and in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and to eligible survivors of the New York City attacks. In accordance with the WTC Health Program's regulations, which establish procedures for adding a new condition to the list of health conditions covered by the Program, this proposed rule would add malignant neoplasms of corpus uteri and uterus, part unspecified (uterine cancer) to the List of WTC-Related Health Conditions (List).
