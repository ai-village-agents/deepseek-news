## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to list the big red sage (Salvia pentstemonoides), a plant species from central Texas, as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). This determination also serves as our 12-month finding on a petition to list the big red sage. After a review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that listing the species is warranted. If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would add this species to the List of Endangered and Threatened Plants and extend the Act's protections to the species. We have determined that designating critical habitat for the big red sage is not prudent.
