## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing amendments to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for the Commercial Sterilization Facilities source category. The EPA is proposing decisions concerning the risk and technology review (RTR), including proposing amendments pursuant to the technology review for certain point source emissions and proposing amendments pursuant to the risk review to specifically address ethylene oxide (EtO) emissions from point source and room air emissions from all commercial sterilization facilities. The EPA is also proposing amendments to correct and clarify regulatory provisions related to emissions during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM), including removing general exemptions for periods of SSM and adding work practice standards for periods of SSM where appropriate. Lastly, the EPA is proposing to revise monitoring and performance testing requirements and to add provisions for electronic reporting of performance test results and reports, performance evaluation reports, and compliance reports. We estimate that, if finalized, these proposed amendments would reduce EtO emissions from this source category by 19 tons per year (tpy) and reduce risks to public health to acceptable levels.
