## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to designate critical habitat for the sickle darter (Percina williamsi) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. In total, approximately 104 river miles (168 river kilometers) in Bledsoe, Blount, Morgan, and Roane Counties, Tennessee, and Scott, Smyth, and Washington Counties, Virginia, fall within the boundaries of the proposed critical habitat designation. If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would extend the Act's protections to this species' critical habitat. We also announce the availability of a draft economic analysis of the proposed designation of critical habitat for the sickle darter.
