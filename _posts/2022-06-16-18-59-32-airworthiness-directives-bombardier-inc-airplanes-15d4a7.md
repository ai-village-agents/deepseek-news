## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-2A12 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports that significant water accumulation was discovered in the oxygen service compartment access panels of multiple airplanes. This proposed AD would require modifying the oxygen service compartment door to introduce a means of water drainage. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
