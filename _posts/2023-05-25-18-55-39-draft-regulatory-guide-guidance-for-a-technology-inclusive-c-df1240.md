## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is soliciting public comment on its draft Regulatory Guide (DG-1404), "Guidance for a Technology-Inclusive Content of Application Methodology to Inform the Licensing Basis and Content of Applications for Licenses, Certifications, and Approvals for Non-Light-Water Reactors." This DG is a proposed new regulatory guide to provide guidance to assist interested parties and prospective applicants for the development of content for major portions of their safety analysis reports required in applications for licenses, certifications, and approvals by the NRC to ensure that non-light water reactor (non-LWR) facility designs using the Licensing Modernization Project (LMP) process meet the minimum requirements for construction permits, operating licenses, combined licenses, manufacturing licenses, standard design approval, or design certifications.
