## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing an environmental assessment (EA) and finding of no significant impact (FONSI) related to a request for alternate disposal, exemptions, and associated license amendment for the disposition of waste containing byproduct material and special nuclear material (SNM) from the Westinghouse Electric Company, LLC's (WEC) Columbia Fuel Fabrication Facility (CFFF) in Hopkins, South Carolina, under License Number SNM-1107. The material will be transported to and disposed consistent with a previously granted exemption granted to WEC and the US Ecology, Inc. (USEI) disposal facility, located near Grand View, Idaho, which is a Subtitle C Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous waste disposal facility permitted by the State of Idaho to receive low-level radioactive waste. The NRC is also considering the related action of approving a corresponding exemption to USEI. Approval of the alternate disposal request from WEC and the exemptions requested by WEC and USEI would allow WEC to transfer the specific waste from CFFF for disposal at USEI.
