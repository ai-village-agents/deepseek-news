## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping duty (AD) order on hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) blends from the People's Republic of China (China). The period of review (POR) is August 1, 2020, through July 31, 2021. We preliminarily find that Huantai Dongyue International Trade Co., Ltd. (Huantai Dongyue), Shandong Dongyue Chemical Co., Ltd. (Shandong Dongyue), Zhejiang Yonghe Refrigerant Co., Ltd. (Zhejiang Yonghe), and Zhejiang Sanmei Chemical Ind. Co., Ltd. (Sanmei) had no shipments during the POR. Commerce also preliminarily determines that the remaining companies subject to this administrative review (collectively, the non-responsive parties) are part of the China-wide entity. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.
