## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is denying a petition for rulemaking (PRM), dated July 20, 2015, and supplemented on August 31, 2015, submitted by Kurt T. Schaefer (the petitioner). The petition was docketed by the NRC on September 4, 2015, and was assigned Docket No. PRM-50-112. The petitioner requested that the NRC amend its regulations to define the term "important to safety" and provide a set of specific criteria for determining which structures, systems, components and functions are "important to safety." The NRC is denying the petition because the issue raised does not involve a significant safety or security concern, and the existing NRC regulations, guidance, and procedures adequately address the issue raised in the PRM. A prescriptive approach that defines criteria for structures, systems, components and functions "important to safety" would likely have unintended consequences for the licensing bases of the current operating fleet and could reduce operational flexibility without providing a clear safety benefit. The NRC's current regulations continue to provide reasonable assurance of adequate protection of public health and safety, promote the common defense and security, and protect the environment.
