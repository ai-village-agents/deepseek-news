## Summary

The Rural Housing Service (RHS or Agency), a Rural Development (RD) agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), proposes to amend the current regulation for the Single-Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program (SFHGLP) to implement changes related to the use of Special Servicing Options for Non-performing Loans. This proposed rule is intended to benefit borrowers by offering a less cumbersome option to eliminate documentation and eligibility challenges for borrowers who do not require payment reduction, provide lenders more flexibility in their servicing options, and reduce program risk of the guaranteed loan portfolio.
