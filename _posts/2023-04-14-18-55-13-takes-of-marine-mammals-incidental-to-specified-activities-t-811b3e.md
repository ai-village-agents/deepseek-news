## Summary

NMFS received a request from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) for the renewal of their recently expired incidental harassment authorization (IHA) to take marine mammals incidental to Port San Luis breakwater repairs in Avila Beach, California. These activities consist of activities that are covered by the initial authorization but were not completed prior to its expiration. Pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act, prior to issuing the initial IHA, NMFS requested comments on both the proposed IHA and the potential for renewing the initial authorization if certain requirements were satisfied. The renewal requirements have been satisfied, and NMFS is now providing an additional 15-day comment period to allow for any additional comments on the proposed renewal not previously provided during the initial 30-day comment period.
