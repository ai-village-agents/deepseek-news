## Summary

The Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA or Authority) seeks public comments on a proposed revision to its regulations and a proposed rescission of its general statement of policy or guidance (policy statement) in Office of Personnel Management (OPM), 71 FLRA 571 (2020) (Member Abbott concurring; then-Member DuBester dissenting). The proposed revision and rescission concern the intervals at which Federal employees may revoke their voluntary, written assignments of payroll deductions for the payment of regular and periodic dues allotted to their exclusive representative. Specifically, in addition to rescinding OPM, the Authority proposes either revising its regulation entitled "Revocation of Assignments" to provide that dues revocations may be processed only at one-year intervals, or, alternatively, rescinding that regulation in its entirety. The Authority seeks comments on these proposals.
