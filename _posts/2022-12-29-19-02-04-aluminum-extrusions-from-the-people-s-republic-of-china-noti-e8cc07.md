## Summary

On December 16, 2022, the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) issued its final judgments in Worldwide Door Components, Inc. v. United States, Slip Op. 22-143, Court No. 19-00012 (Worldwide IV), and Columbia Aluminum Products, LLC v. United States, Slip Op. 22-144, Court No. 19-00013 (Columbia IV), sustaining the U.S. Department of Commerce's (Commerce) third remand redeterminations pertaining to the scope ruling for the antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on aluminum extrusions from the People's Republic of China (China). In the redeterminations, Commerce found that certain door thresholds imported by Worldwide Door Components, Inc. (Worldwide) and Columbia Aluminum Products, Inc. (Columbia) are outside the scope of the orders, pursuant to the CIT's remand orders in Worldwide Door Components, Inc. v. United States, Court No. 19-00012, Slip Op. 22-91 (CIT August 10, 2022) (Worldwide III) and Columbia Aluminum Products, Inc. v. United States, Court No. 19-00013, Slip Op. 22-92 (CIT August 10, 2022) (Columbia III). Commerce is notifying the public that the CIT's final judgments are not in harmony with Commerce's final scope ruling, and that Commerce is amending the scope ruling to find that the Worldwide and Columbia door thresholds are outside the scope of the orders.
