## Summary

NMFS is implementing regulations under the Tuna Conventions Act of 1950, as amended (TCA), to implement Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) Resolution C-21-05 ("Measures for the Conservation and Management of Bluefin Tuna in the Eastern Pacific Ocean"). This final rule implements annual limits on commercial catch of Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis) in the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) for 2022-2024. This action is necessary to conserve Pacific bluefin tuna and for the United States (U.S.) to satisfy its obligations as a member of the IATTC.
