## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its spent fuel storage regulations by revising the NAC International, Inc. MAGNASTOR[supreg] Storage System listing within the "List of approved spent fuel storage casks" to include Amendment No. 14 and revisions to Amendment Nos. 0 through 13 to Certificate of Compliance No. 1031. Amendment No. 14 and revisions to Amendment Nos. 0 through 13 revise the certificate of compliance to add a revised method of evaluation for the non-mechanistic tipover accident, clarify in the technical specifications that damaged missing grid spacers only apply to pressurized-water reactor fuel assembles, clarify inlet and outlet vent blockage and surveillance requirements in limiting condition for operation 3.1.2 in Appendix A to the certificate of compliance and associated technical specification bases, and remove the reference to Type II Portland cement in the description of the certificate of compliance. The NRC is also correcting typographical errors in Revision 1 to Amendment Nos. 11 to 13 and Amendment No. 14 to Certificate of Compliance No. 1031.
