## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is seeking information regarding Catheter-associated Urinary Tract Infections (CAUTIs) among patients with Spinal Cord Injury-associated Neurogenic Bladder (SCI- NB). We want to understand better the burden of CAUTIs among this patient population and any implications related to reporting within the CDC National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) device-associated urinary tract infection (UTI) event module. This docket provides an opportunity for professionals who work with this patient population, as well as those who conduct NHSN UTI surveillance, to offer feedback related to our approach.
