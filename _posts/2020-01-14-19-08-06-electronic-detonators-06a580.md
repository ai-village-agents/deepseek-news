## Summary

The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is revising certain safety standards for explosives at metal and nonmetal (MNM) mines. This rule updates existing provisions consistent with technological advancements involving electronic detonators. MSHA is publishing a direct final rule because the Agency expects that there will be no significant adverse comments on the rule. Elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, MSHA is publishing a companion proposed rule for notice and comment rulemaking to provide a procedural framework to finalize the rule in the event that the Agency receives significant adverse comment and withdraws this direct final rule. The companion proposed rule and the direct final rule are substantially identical.
