## Summary

This regulation established exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of propanamide, 2-hydroxy-N, N-dimethyl-, when used as an inert ingredient (solvent/co-solvent) in pesticides applied to growing crops and raw agricultural commodities after harvest, or in pesticides applied to animals, limited to 50% by weight in the pesticide formulations. Spring Trading Company, LLC on behalf of BASF Corporation submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an amendment to an existing requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of propanamide, 2-hydroxy-N, N-dimethyl-, when used in accordance with the terms of these exemptions.
