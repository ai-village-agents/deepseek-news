## Summary

The FAA is correcting an airworthiness directive (AD) that was published in the Federal Register. That AD applies to all The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER series airplanes. As published, the service information referenced in certain paragraphs of the regulatory text is incorrect, and the dates specified in the "System Airworthiness Limitation No. 3--Fan Blade Out Conditions" text and "System Airworthiness Limitation No. 4--Engine Nacelle Maintenance Errors" text of figure 1 to paragraph (j) of the regulatory text are incorrect. This document corrects those errors. In all other respects, the original document remains the same.
