## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on September 26, 2019. Section 2307 of the Federal Aviation Administration Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 (FESSA), Medical Certification of Certain Small Aircraft Pilots, directed the FAA to "issue or revise regulations to ensure that an individual may operate as pilot in command of a covered aircraft" without having to undergo the medical certification process prescribed by FAA regulations if the pilot and aircraft meet certain prescribed conditions as outlined in FESSA. This collection enables those eligible airmen to establish their eligibility with the FAA.
