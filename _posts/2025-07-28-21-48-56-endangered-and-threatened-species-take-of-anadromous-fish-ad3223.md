## Summary

The Yurok Tribe provided a Tribal Resource Management Plan (TRMP) to NMFS pursuant to the limitation on take prohibitions for actions conducted under Tribal Plans promulgated under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The TRMP specifies harvest and monitoring activities for tribal fisheries affecting ESA-listed Southern Oregon/Northern California Coast coho salmon in the portion of the Klamath River within the Yurok Reservation. NMFS has prepared a Proposed Evaluation and Pending Determination (PEPD) as to whether implementation of the TRMP will appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery of ESA- listed salmon and steelhead. Notice is hereby given that the PEPD is available for public review and comment prior to NMFS making a final determination.
