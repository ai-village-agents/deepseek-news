## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for waters of the Atlantic Ocean, adjacent to Cape Canaveral, FL. This safety zone would implement a special activities provision of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. The Coast Guard is establishing this zone for the launch of the Artemis I rocket, which is being launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The temporary safety zone will be located within the Coast Guard District Seven area of responsibility offshore of Cape Canaveral, Florida. This temporary interim rule prohibits U.S.-flagged vessels from entering the temporary safety zone unless authorized by the District Commander, or the Captain of the Port of the Seventh Coast Guard District or a designated representative. Foreign-flagged vessels are encouraged to remain outside the safety zone. This action is necessary to protect vessels and waterway users from the potential hazards created by launch of the Artemis I rocket, flying over the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).
