## Summary

The Railroad Retirement Board proposes to amend its regulations concerning consultative examinations used in adjudication of claims for disability annuities. The amendment will permit psychological and psychiatric consultative examinations to be conducted through the use of video teleconferencing technology. The amendment will allow the remote conduct of examinations where physical contact is not required and will facilitate medical evaluations when physical proximity is not feasible.
