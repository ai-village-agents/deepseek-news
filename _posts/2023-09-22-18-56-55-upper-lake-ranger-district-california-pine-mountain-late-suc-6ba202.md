## Summary

The Mendocino National Forest is withdrawing its draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) for the Pine Mountain Late- Successional Reserve Habitat Protection and Enhancement Project on the Upper Lake Ranger District. The Mendocino National Forest's decision to withdraw the DEIS is due to major changes to the landscape after the 2018 Ranch Fire. Multiple challenges delayed the publication of this notification including the government furlough in 2019, Covid pandemic starting in 2020, the 2020 1-million-acre August Complex wildfire and a shift in forest priorities to recover the acres burned in the August Complex.
