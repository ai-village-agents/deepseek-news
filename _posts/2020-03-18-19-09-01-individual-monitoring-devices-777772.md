## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations to authorize the use of modern individual monitoring devices in industrial radiographic, irradiator, and well logging operations. These amendments will align personnel dosimetry requirements in these areas with the requirements for all other NRC licensees. This direct final rule addresses an issue raised in a petition for rulemaking and will affect NRC and Agreement State licensees. The NRC also is issuing supplemental guidance for use and comment with this direct final rule.
