## Summary

NOAA's National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) collaborated with NOAA NMFS to initiate a marine spatial planning study to identify draft Aquaculture Opportunity Area (AOA) Options within State waters of southeast, southcentral, and southwest Alaska as part of the AOA identification process. An AOA is a defined geographic area that has been evaluated to determine its potential suitability for commercial aquaculture. NOAA is identifying AOAs as directed by Executive Order, "Promoting American Seafood Competitiveness and Economic Growth" (May 7, 2020). This notice invites public comment on the preliminary results of the marine spatial planning study including the identification of draft AOA Options in Alaska State waters. NMFS will consider information received in response to this notice when finalizing the results of the marine spatial planning study, and may or may not identify AOAs after further public participation and review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).
