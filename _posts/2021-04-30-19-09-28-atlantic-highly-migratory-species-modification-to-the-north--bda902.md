## Summary

NMFS is adjusting the current regulations for North Atlantic swordfish and shark retention limits for certain permit holders in U.S. Atlantic and Caribbean waters. Specifically, this action will modify swordfish retention limits for highly migratory species (HMS) Commercial Caribbean Small Boat permit holders, Swordfish General Commercial permit holders, and HMS Charter/Headboat permit holders with a commercial endorsement on a non-for hire (i.e., commercial) trip. This action will also modify the shark retention limits for HMS Commercial Caribbean Small Boat permit holders. Additionally, this action will add regulatory criteria for inseason adjustment of swordfish and shark retention limits for the HMS Commercial Caribbean Small Boat permit. The changes are expected to provide fishermen with greater flexibility, establish greater consistency across regions, and improve the efficiency of swordfish and shark management.
