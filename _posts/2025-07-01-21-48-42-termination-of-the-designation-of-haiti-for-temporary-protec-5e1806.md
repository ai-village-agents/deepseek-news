## Summary

Through this notice, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announces that the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) is terminating the designation of Haiti for Temporary Protected Status (TPS). The designation of Haiti is set to expire on August 3, 2025. After reviewing country conditions and consulting with appropriate U.S. Government agencies, the Secretary determined that Haiti no longer continues to meet the conditions for designation for TPS. The Secretary, therefore, is terminating the TPS designation of Haiti as required by statute. This termination is effective September 2, 2025. After September 2, 2025, nationals of Haiti (and aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in Haiti) who have been granted TPS under Haiti's designation will no longer have TPS.
