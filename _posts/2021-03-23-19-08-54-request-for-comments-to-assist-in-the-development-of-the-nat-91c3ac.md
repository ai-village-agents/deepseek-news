## Summary

The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) is in the process of developing a new strategic plan for the years 2022-2026. The NEA Office of Research & Analysis is soliciting public input to inform the development of the NEA 2022-2026 Strategic Plan. Through this Request for Comments, the NEA invites ideas and insights from the general public, including arts organizations, artists, arts educators, state and local arts agencies, other arts funders and policy-makers, researchers, and individuals and groups outside the arts sector. In the summer of 2021, stakeholders will have a second opportunity to provide comments and input in response to the drafted version of the NEA 2022- 2026 Strategic Plan.
