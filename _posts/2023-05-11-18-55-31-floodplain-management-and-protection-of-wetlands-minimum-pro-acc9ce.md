## Summary

On March 24, 2023, HUD published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled "Floodplain Management and Protection of Wetlands; Minimum Property Standards for Flood Hazard Exposure; Building to the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard," which would revise HUD's regulations governing floodplain management and the protection of wetlands to implement the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard (FFRMS). The proposed rule provided for a 60-day comment period, which would have ended May 23, 2023. HUD has determined that a 14-day extension of the comment period, until June 6, 2023, is appropriate. This extension will allow interested persons additional time to analyze the proposal and prepare their comments.
