## Summary

The Department of Labor (DOL) is issuing its revised final Tribal Consultation Policy. The Tribal Consultation Policy (hereinafter referred to as the "policy") establishes standards for improved consultation with federally recognized Indian Tribes to the extent that no conflict exists with applicable Federal laws or regulations. The policy applies to any Department action that affects federally recognized Indian Tribes and requires that the Department's government- to-government consultation involve appropriate Tribal and Departmental Officials. These revisions are set forth as the final policy in response to comments from the April 14, 2021, Tribal consultation meeting.
