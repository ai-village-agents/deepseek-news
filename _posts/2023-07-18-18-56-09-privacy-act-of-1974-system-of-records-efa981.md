## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, and the Office of Management and Budget and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-108 Federal Agency Responsibilities for Review, Reporting, and Publication under the Privacy Act, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) proposes a new system of records for the information collected, created, and stored in the centralized omni-channel AskUSDA Contact Center. The purpose of this system is to provide industry standard customer service to respond to inquiries from the general public regarding programs and services provided by USDA. The system keeps track of the people asking questions for continuity of support and maintains a record of their interaction. The system provides multiple public channels like phone, email, and live chat. Also, the system maintains a common knowledge base across the organization that improves response consistency. This system also improves the efficiency of the Federal staff providing answers to public inquiry.
