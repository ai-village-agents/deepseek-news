## Summary

The National Park Service removes from the Code of Federal Regulations special fishing regulations for Mount Rainier National Park, including those that restrict the take of nonnative species. Instead, the National Park Service will publish closures and restrictions related to fishing in the Superintendent's Compendium for the park. This action helps implement a 2018 Fish Management Plan that aims to conserve native fish populations and restore aquatic ecosystems by reducing or eliminating nonnative fish.
