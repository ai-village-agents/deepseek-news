## Summary

This part was established to prescribe the Department of Defense (DoD) policy and procedures for the registration, inspection, and marking of privately owned vehicles (POV) on Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) activities. Since the requirement to register, inspect, and mark privately-owned vehicles on DLA activities was rescinded in 2012, the need for this part no longer exists, and it should be removed from the CFR.
