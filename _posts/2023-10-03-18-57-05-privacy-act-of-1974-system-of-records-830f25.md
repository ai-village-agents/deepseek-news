## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) provides notice that it is rescinding CFPB.007 CFPB Directory Database from its inventory of record systems. The system of records provided the CFPB with a single, agency-wide repository of identifying and registration information concerning entities offering or providing, or materially assisting in the offering or provision of, consumer financial products or services. The CFPB is rescinding this system of records notice because this system is not currently maintained by CFPB, thereby making the system of records notice unnecessary.
