## Summary

Based on a review of existing import requirements, CDC has determined that the import requirements for civets (Family: Viverridae) are no longer necessary to protect the public's health and should therefore be rescinded. Accordingly, effective immediately, CDC is rescinding its embargo on the importation of civets (Family: Viverridae).
