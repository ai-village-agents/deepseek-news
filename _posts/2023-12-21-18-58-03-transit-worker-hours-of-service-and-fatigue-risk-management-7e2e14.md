## Summary

The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) is extending the comment period for the advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding transit worker hours of service and fatigue risk management, published on October 30, 2023, with the original comment period closing on December 29, 2023. The extension is based on concerns from the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) that the comment period did not provide sufficient time to review and provide comprehensive comments to the ANPRM due to two Federal holidays and the closure of many offices between Christmas and New Year's Day. FTA recognizes that others interested in commenting may have similar concerns and agrees that the comment period should be extended.
