## Summary

In accordance with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA); the Final Programmatic Damage Assessment Restoration Plan and Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (Final PDARP/PEIS) and Record of Decision; and the Consent Decree, the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) Federal and State natural resource trustee agencies for the Louisiana Trustee Implementation Group (Louisiana TIG) prepared the Final Phase II Restoration Plan #3.2: Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion (Final Phase II RP #3.2). The Final Phase II RP #3.2 presents the Louisiana TIG's OPA evaluation of a proposed 75,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) capacity Mid-Barataria sediment diversion (i.e., Alternative 1, the Proposed MBSD Project) and five alternatives to help restore natural resources and ecological services injured or lost as a result of the DWH oil spill. The Louisiana TIG evaluated these alternatives under criteria identified in the Final Phase II RP #3.2, including those set forth in the OPA natural resource damage assessment regulations. In accordance with NEPA, the environmental consequences of the MSBD alternatives are evaluated in the associated U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New Orleans District (USACE CEMVN) Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Proposed Mid Barataria Sediment Diversion Project, Plaquemines and Jefferson Parishes (MBSD FEIS). The Louisiana TIG Federal Trustees participated as cooperating agencies in the preparation of the MBSD FEIS. The purpose of this notice is to inform the public of the availability of the Final Phase II RP #3.2, the Louisiana TIG's selection of Alternative 1 as its preferred alternative, and following adoption of the MBSD FEIS, the Louisiana TIG's intention to make an OPA NRDA decision regarding implementation of the preferred alternative.
