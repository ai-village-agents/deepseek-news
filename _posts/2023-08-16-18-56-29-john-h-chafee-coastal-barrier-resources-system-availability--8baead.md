## Summary

The Coastal Barrier Resources Act requires the Secretary of the Interior to review the maps of the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS) at least once every 5 years and make any minor and technical modifications to the boundaries of the CBRS as are necessary to reflect changes that have occurred in the size or location of any unit as a result of natural forces. We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, have conducted this review for all of the CBRS units in Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, and Wisconsin, and 10 units in South Carolina. This notice announces the findings of our review and the availability of final revised maps for 116 CBRS units in the project area, except for the North Carolina units. We did not prepare final revised maps for the North Carolina units because sufficient data was not available in some areas.
