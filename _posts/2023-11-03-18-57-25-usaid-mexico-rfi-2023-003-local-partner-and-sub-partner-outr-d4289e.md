## Summary

USAID/Mexico is seeking to increase understanding of the organizational landscape throughout the country to enhance USAID's development approach and understand local organizations' priority topic areas and capacities. USAID is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to solicit information and potential interest from organizations to diversify USAID's partner and sub-partner base. The goal of the RFI is to better understand the organizational landscape in Mexico; diversify USAID/Mexico's partner and sub-partner base by creating avenues for new and underutilized partners and sub-partners to work with USAID; and brainstorm methods to support partners and sub-partners to become self-reliant and capable of achieving their development goals. The research data will be aggregated and not provide PII or other privacy-related information. USAID/Mexico invites the general public and other Federal agencies to take this opportunity to comment on the following new information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
