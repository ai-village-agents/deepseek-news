## Summary

This proposed rule would update the prospective payment rates, the outlier threshold, and the wage index for Medicare inpatient hospital services provided by Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities (IPF), which include psychiatric hospitals and excluded psychiatric units of an Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) hospital or critical access hospital. This rule also proposes to update and clarify the IPF teaching policy with respect to IPF hospital closures and displaced residents and proposes a technical change to the 2016-based IPF market basket price proxies. In addition, this proposed rule would update quality measures and reporting requirements under the Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities Quality Reporting (IPFQR) Program. These changes would be effective for IPF discharges occurring during the Fiscal Year (FY) beginning October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022 (FY 2022).
