## Summary

The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA) and other related statutes, such as the FREEDOM Support Act, the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962, and the SEED Act of 1989, authorize the U.S. Department of State (Department of State, State, or Department) to provide foreign assistance that seeks to support efforts that would have the effect of protecting and promoting U.S. security, prosperity, and democratic values and shape an international environment to improve the lives of people around the world. To implement the Department's expectation of nondiscrimination against beneficiaries of Department- funded foreign assistance activities, the Department is proposing to amend its Department of State Acquisition Regulation (DOSAR) to include a new contract clause entitled "Nondiscrimination in Foreign Assistance." The proposed clause expressly states that contractors and subcontractors receiving Department-funded foreign assistance funds must not discriminate on specified bases against end-users of supplies or services (also referred to in this rule as beneficiaries and potential beneficiaries) or in certain employment decisions involving persons employed in the performance of this contract and funded in whole or in part with foreign assistance funds except where target populations are specified in the relevant statement of work (SOW) or as otherwise required by U.S. law.
