## Summary

The Department of Labor is withdrawing the proposed rule that accompanied its direct final rule (DFR) that requires electronic filing (e-filing) and makes acceptance of electronic service (e-service) automatic for attorneys and non-attorney representatives representing parties in proceedings before the Administrative Review Board (Board), unless the Board authorizes non-electronic filing and service for good cause; establishes a new part containing rules of practice and procedure for the Board; and amends existing regulations concerning filing and service that apply where a governing statute or executive order does not establish contrary rules of filing and service.
