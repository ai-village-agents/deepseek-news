## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("Commission" or "CFTC") is proposing revisions to the Commission's regulations that set forth large trader position reporting requirements for futures and options. First, the Commission is proposing to remove an outdated 80- character submission standard and delegate certain authority to the Office of Data and Technology to designate a modern submission standard for certain reports required to be submitted. Second, the Commission is proposing to replace certain enumerated data fields with an appendix specifying applicable data elements and a separate Guidebook specifying the form and manner for reporting. These revisions would modernize large trader position reporting and align it with other reporting structures set out in the Commission's regulations.
