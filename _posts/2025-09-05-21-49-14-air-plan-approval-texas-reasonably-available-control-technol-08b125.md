## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve the May 12, 2020, and May 13, 2020, revisions to the Texas State Implementation Plan (SIP) as satisfying the Serious classification Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) requirement for the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) 2008 8-hour ozone National Air Quality Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) nonattainment area. The DFW area, designated as Serious for the 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS, consists of Collin, Dallas, Denton, Ellis, Johnson, Kaufman, Parker, Rockwall, Tarrant, and Wise Counties. Specifically, we are proposing to approve the revisions to 30 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) Chapter 115 to implement the major source Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) requirement for VOC as addressed in the VOC RACT analysis and negative declaration included with the Serious area Attainment Demonstration (AD) SIP revision. The Nitrogen Oxide (NO<INF>X</INF>) portion of the RACT analysis in the May 13, 2020, revisions will be addressed in a separate action.
