## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on the extension of an information collection project titled Promoting Adolescent Health through School-Based HIV Prevention. CDC will continue to use a web- based system to collect data on the strategies that funded Local Education Agencies (LEAs) are using to meet their goals related to three strategies: Delivery of sexual health education (SHE) emphasizing HIV and other STD prevention, increasing adolescent access to key sexual health services (SHS), and establishing safe and supportive environments (SSE) for students and staff.
