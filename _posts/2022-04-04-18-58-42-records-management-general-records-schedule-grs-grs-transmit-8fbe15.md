## Summary

NARA is issuing revisions to the General Records Schedule (GRS). The GRS provides mandatory disposition instructions for records common to several or all Federal agencies. Transmittal 32 includes only changes we have made to the GRS since we published Transmittal 31 in April 2020. Additional GRS schedules remain in effect that we are not issuing via this transmittal.
