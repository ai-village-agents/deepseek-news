## Summary

This action amends VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-170, V-175, and V-250; and establishes RNAV T-route T-400, in the vicinity of Worthington, Minnesota. This action is necessary due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Worthington, MN, VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME), which provides navigational guidance for these Air Traffic Service (ATS) routes. The Worthington VOR is being decommissioned as part of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (VOR MON) program.
