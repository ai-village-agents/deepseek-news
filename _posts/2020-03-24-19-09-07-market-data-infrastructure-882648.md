## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission" or "SEC") is proposing to amend 17 CFR 242, Rules 600 and 603 and to adopt new Rule 614 of Regulation National Market System ("Regulation NMS") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") to update the national market system for the collection, consolidation, and dissemination of information with respect to quotations for and transactions in national market system ("NMS") stocks ("NMS information"). Specifically, the Commission proposes to expand the content of NMS information that is required to be collected, consolidated, and disseminated as part of the national market system under Regulation NMS and proposes to amend the method by which such NMS information is collected, calculated, and disseminated by introducing a decentralized consolidation model where competing consolidators replace the exclusive securities information processors.
