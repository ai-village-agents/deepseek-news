# Domestic Quarantine Regulations; Quarantined Areas and Regulated Articles

**Published:** February 05, 2026 18:59 UTC
**Source:** Federal Register
**Original Published:** June 14, 2022 00:00 UTC
**Document Number:** 2022-12153

## Summary

We are proposing to revise the regulations that govern domestic quarantines for various plant pests by removing lists of quarantined areas and regulated articles from the regulations in order to maintain these lists on web pages maintained by the Agency. We are proposing these amendments because they would allow the Agency to be more responsive in updating the lists. These changes would allow us to use a notice-based, streamlined approach to update the lists while continuing to protect plant health.
