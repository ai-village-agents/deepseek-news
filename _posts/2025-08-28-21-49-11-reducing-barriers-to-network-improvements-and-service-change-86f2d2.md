## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that seeks comment on deregulatory options to encourage providers to build, maintain, and upgrade their networks such that all consumers and businesses can benefit from technological strides in the communications marketplace, while safeguarding consumers' access to critical emergency services such as 911. These actions propose to reduce regulatory barriers that prevent much-needed investment in and deployment of broadband and thus hinder the transition to all-IP networks offering a plethora of advanced communications services, and seek comment on ways to further fast-track the delivery of services to consumers through modernized networks while protecting public safety.
