# Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Microwave Ovens

## Summary

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended ("EPCA"), prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment, including microwave ovens. EPCA also requires the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE" or "the Department") to periodically determine whether more-stringent standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would result in significant energy savings. In this supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking ("SNOPR"), DOE proposes amended energy conservation standards for microwave ovens, and requests comment on these proposed standards and associated analyses and results.
