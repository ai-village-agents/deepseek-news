# Airworthiness Directives; GE Aviation Czech s.r.o. (Type Certificate Previously Held by WALTER Engines a.s., Walter a.s., and MOTORLET a.s.) Turboprop Engines

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all GE Aviation Czech s.r.o. (GEAC) M601E-11AS, M601E[hyphen]11S, H75-100, H80-100, and H85-100 model turboprop engines. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of multiple failures of the needle bearing installed in propeller governors having part numbers (P/Ns) P-W11-1 or P-W11-2, caused by self-generated debris from the needle bearing, which led to oil contamination. This proposed AD would require replacement of the affected propeller governors with a redesigned propeller governor, and would prohibit installation of the affected propeller governors, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
