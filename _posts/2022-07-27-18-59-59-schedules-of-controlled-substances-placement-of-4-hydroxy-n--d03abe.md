## Summary

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is withdrawing a proposed rule that was published in the Federal Register on January 14, 2022, which proposed to place five tryptamine hallucinogens in schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. Upon further consideration, DEA has determined that it is appropriate to submit a new request to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for an updated scientific and medical evaluation and scheduling recommendation for these substances. Accordingly, DEA is withdrawing the proposed rule and notice of hearing that was published in the Federal Register on July 6, 2022, and is canceling the public hearing and terminating the pending hearing proceedings. DEA may issue a new proposed rule in the future regarding these substances if warranted.
