## Summary

The Coast Guard will enforce the Delaware River, Philadelphia, PA Safety Zone for fireworks displays on two separate periods. The safety zone will first be enforced on June 21, 2023, and again, on July 1, 2023. This is to provide for the safety of life on navigable waterways during each of two separate barge-based fireworks displays. Our regulation for marine events within the Fifth Coast Guard District identifies the regulated area for this event in Philadelphia, PA. During the enforcement period, no person or vessel may enter, remain in, or transit through the regulated area, and anyone in the vicinity must comply with directions from the Patrol Commander or any Official Patrol displaying a Coast Guard ensign.
