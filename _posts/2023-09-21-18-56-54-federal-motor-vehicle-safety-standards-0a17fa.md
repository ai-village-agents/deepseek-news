## Summary

This document denies a petition for rulemaking submitted by Mr. Eddie L. Fray on behalf of the Parent Advocacy Group on November 27, 2015. The petitioner requested that the Secretary of Transportation mandate installation of specific products and systems as well other complementary safety features intended to prevent pediatric heatstroke in vehicles. NHTSA is denying the petition because the Agency does not initiate rulemaking to require installation of specific products.
