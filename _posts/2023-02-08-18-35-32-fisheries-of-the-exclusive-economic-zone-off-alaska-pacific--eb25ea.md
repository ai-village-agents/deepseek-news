## Summary

NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Pacific cod by non- American Fisheries Act (AFA) crab vessels that are subject to sideboard limits, and operating as catcher vessels (CVs) using pot gear, in the Central Regulatory Area of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the 2023 sideboard limit established for non-AFA crab vessels that are operating as CVs using pot gear in the Central Regulatory Area of the GOA.
