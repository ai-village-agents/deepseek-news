## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) permanently debarring Yvelice Villaman-Bencosme from providing services in any capacity to a person that has an approved or pending drug product application. FDA bases this order on a finding that Yvelice Villaman-Bencosme was convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct relating to the development or approval, including the process of development or approval, of a drug product under the FD&C Act. Ms. Villaman-Bencosme was given notice of the proposed permanent debarment and was given an opportunity to request a hearing to show why she should not be debarred. As of December 13, 2021 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Ms. Villaman-Bencosme had not responded. Ms. Villaman- Bencosme's failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of her right to a hearing concerning this action.
