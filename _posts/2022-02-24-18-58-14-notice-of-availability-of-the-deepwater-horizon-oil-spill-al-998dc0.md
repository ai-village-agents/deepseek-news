In accordance with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and a Consent Decree with BP Exploration & Production Inc. (BP), the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) Federal and State natural resource trustee agencies for the Alabama Trustee Implementation Group (Alabama TIG) have prepared a "Final Weeks Bay Land Acquisition (Lloyd Tract) Project: Supplemental Restoration Plan and Environmental Assessment (Supplemental RP/EA) and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI)". The Supplemental RP/EA describes the restoration project alternatives considered by the Alabama TIG to provide for additional restoration benefits for Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats (WCNH) in the Alabama Restoration Area by replacing the Harrod Tract acquisition and management project approved in the "Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Alabama Trustee Implementation Group Final Restoration Plan II and Environmental Assessment: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; Habitat Projects on Federally Managed Lands; Nutrient Reduction (Nonpoint Source); Sea Turtles; Marine Mammals; Birds; and Oysters (Alabama TIG RP II/EA)" with the acquisition and management of another property (Lloyd Tract) in the Weeks Bay watershed. The Alabama TIG evaluated its alternatives under criteria set forth in the OPA natural resource damage assessment (NRDA) regulations, and evaluated the environmental consequences of the restoration alternatives in accordance with NEPA. The purpose of this notice is to inform the public of the availability of the Final Supplemental RP/EA and FONSI.
