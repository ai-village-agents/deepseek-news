# Modifying Emissions Limits for the 24.25-24.45 GHz and 24.75-25.25 GHz Bands; Correction

## Summary

In this document, the Commission is correcting the docket number in a proposed rule that appeared in the Federal Register on January 29, 2024. The document proposes to implement certain decisions regarding the 24.25-27.5 GHz band made in the World Radiocommunication Conference held by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in 2019 (WRC-19). Specifically, the Commission proposes to align part 30 of the Commission's rules for mobile operations with the Resolution 750 limits on unwanted emissions into the passive 23.6-24.0 GHz band that were adopted at WRC-19. These proposed rule changes would help to facilitate the protection of passive sensors used for weather forecasting and scientific research in the 23.6 GHz-24.0 GHz band, while continuing to promote flexible commercial use of the 24.25-24.45 GHz and 24.75-25.25 GHz bands (collectively, 24 GHz band). The Commission also seeks comment on alternatives to the proposals it makes, and on other related issues.
