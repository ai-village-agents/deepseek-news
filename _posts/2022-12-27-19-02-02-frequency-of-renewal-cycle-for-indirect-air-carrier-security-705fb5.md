# Frequency of Renewal Cycle for Indirect Air Carrier Security Programs

## Summary

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is proposing to modify its regulations to reduce the frequency of renewal applications by indirect air carriers (IACs). Rather than requiring these entities to submit an application to renew their security program each year, TSA is proposing to require renewal once every three years. This modification would reduce the burden of compliance without a negative impact on security and would support this industry's economic recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 public health crisis.
