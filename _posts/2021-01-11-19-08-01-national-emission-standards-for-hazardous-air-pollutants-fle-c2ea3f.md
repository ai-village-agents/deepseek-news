## Summary

This action presents the proposed results of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) residual risk and technology review (RTR) required under the Clean Air Act (CAA) for the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for major source Flexible Polyurethane Foam Fabrication Operations, initially promulgated in 2003. Pursuant to the CAA, this action also presents the proposed results of the technology review for the NESHAP for two area source categories, Flexible Polyurethane Foam Production and Flexible Polyurethane Foam Fabrication, which are combined in one subpart initially promulgated in 2007. In this action, the EPA is proposing to establish a numeric emission limit for one major source subcategory; remove exemptions for periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) and specify that the emissions standards apply at all times; require periodic performance tests; and require electronic reporting of performance test results and compliance reports. Implementation of these proposed rules is not expected to result in significant changes to the hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions from affected facilities in these three source categories or to human health impacts or environmental impacts associated with those emissions. However, this action, if finalized, would result in improved monitoring, compliance, and implementation of the existing standards and codify existing industry practices to prevent backsliding.
