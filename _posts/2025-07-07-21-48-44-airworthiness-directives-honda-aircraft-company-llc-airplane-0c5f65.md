## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Honda Aircraft Company LLC (Honda) Model HA-420 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by the discovery of a gap between the trailing edge wing nut plates and leading edge aileron balance weights being less than the minimum required clearance. This proposed AD would require replacing the affected left and right aileron fixed balance weights with reduced geometry fixed balance weights. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
