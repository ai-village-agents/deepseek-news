## Summary

This final rule amends existing project-based Section 8 regulations related to Management and Occupancy Reviews (MORs) for the following seven project-based Section 8 programs administered by the Office of Multifamily Housing Programs: the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) Programs for New Construction, Substantial Rehabilitation, State Housing Agencies, New Construction financed under Section 515 of the Housing Act of 1949, the Loan Management Set-Aside Program, the HAP Program for the Disposition of HUD-Owned Projects, and the Section 202/8 Program. Under this final rule, MORs will be conducted in accordance with a performance-based schedule published in the Federal Register, following a notice and comment period. The first such schedule is being published concurrently with this final rule and can be found elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register. HUD is making this move to a performance-based MOR schedule to establish a risk-based scheduling protocol, reduce the frequency of MORs for projects that consistently perform well, and provide consistency across programs with respect to MOR frequency. Additionally, HUD is correcting a regulatory citation in its regulations concerning the Section 8 Housing Assistance Program for the Disposition of HUD-Owned Projects.
