## Summary

The Surface Transportation Project Delivery Program (STPD Program), often referred to as the "NEPA Assignment Program," allows a State to assume FRA's environmental responsibilities for Federal environmental review, consultation, and compliance under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for railroad projects. When a State assumes these responsibilities, it carries out the assigned environmental review process, in lieu of FRA. The STPD Program requires annual audits for the first four years of the State's lead role in the program to ensure compliance with program requirements. FRA is issuing this notice to advise the public that it has conducted the second annual audit of the State of California, acting by and through, the California High-Speed Rail Authority (CHSRA), and seek comment from the public on the draft audit report. Following the comment period, FRA will publish a final audit report.
