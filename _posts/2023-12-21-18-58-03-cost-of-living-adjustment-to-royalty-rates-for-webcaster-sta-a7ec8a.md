## Summary

On November 30, 2023, the Copyright Royalty Judges amended regulations governing royalty rates that commercial and noncommercial noninteractive webcasters pay for eligible transmissions pursuant to the statutory licenses for the public performance of and for the making of ephemeral reproductions of sound recordings. That document contained an incorrect reference to a rate. This document corrects that reference.
