## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is conducting rulemaking to add requirements for calibration and dosage measurement for certain generator systems and establish performance-based requirements for existing and future emerging medical technologies. The NRC is also considering additional changes to its medical use regulations to accommodate developments in the medical field related to new radiopharmaceuticals and emerging medical technologies. The rulemaking will affect medical licensees who use these technologies and evaluate the current training and experience requirements for emerging medical technologies. The NRC is requesting comments from the public on the regulatory basis for this rulemaking. The NRC plans to hold one or more public meetings during the comment period to promote full understanding of the contemplated action and facilitate public comment.
