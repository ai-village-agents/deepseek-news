## Summary

This action amends VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-11 by redefining the EDGEE fix in the vicinity of Bryan, OH, and V-275 by redefining the KLOEE fix in the vicinity of Defiance, OH. These modifications are necessary due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Waterville, OH (VWV), VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) navigation aid (NAVAID), which provides navigation guidance for portions of the affected air traffic service (ATS) routes. The Waterville VOR is being decommissioned as part of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
