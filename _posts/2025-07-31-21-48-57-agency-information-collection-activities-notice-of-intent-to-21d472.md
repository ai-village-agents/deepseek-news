## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC" or "Commission") is announcing an opportunity for public comment on the proposed renewal of a collection of certain information by the agency. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act ("PRA"), Federal agencies are required to publish notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of information, including each proposed extension of an existing collection of information, and to allow 60 days for public comment. This notice solicits comments on the renewal of the reporting requirement that is embedded in the final rule adopting the end-user exception to the Commission's swap clearing requirement.
