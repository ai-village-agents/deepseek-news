## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-25- 14, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, - 115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, - 212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2021-25-14 required repetitive inspections for cracking at the wing manhole access panel attachment holes at certain wing skin panels, and corrective action if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-25-14, new investigation results determined that additional airplanes are subject to the unsafe condition and certain structural repair manual (SRM) tasks should not be used to accomplish repairs. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2021-25-14. This AD also changes the applicability to both add and remove airplane models, updates the compliance times, and prohibits the use of certain SRM tasks for repair. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
