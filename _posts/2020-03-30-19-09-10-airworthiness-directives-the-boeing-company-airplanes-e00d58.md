## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 757-200, -200PF, -200CB, and -300 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that during a maintenance check an operator discovered cracking of the aft cargo compartment frames in the station 1460 frame web and inner chord between certain stringers. This AD requires an inspection of the fuselage frames for any existing repair, repetitive surface high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections of the fuselage frames with a cargo liner support channel for any cracking, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
