## Summary

The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) of the Department of Labor (Department) is confirming the effective date of September 2, 2025, for the direct final rule that was published in the Federal Register on July 1, 2025. This direct final rule removes the regulations that implemented and governed the Title I Workforce Investment Act (WIA) programs at the national, State, and local levels and provided program requirements applicable to all WIA formula and competitive funds. Title I of WIA was repealed by Congress with the enactment of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) on June 22, 2014, and all remaining grant funding under WIA Title I has been closed out by the Department. Accordingly, these regulations are no longer necessary, and the Department is removing the regulations from the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) for programs that are no longer operative.
