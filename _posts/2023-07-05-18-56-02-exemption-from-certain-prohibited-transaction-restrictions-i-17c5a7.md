## Summary

This document contains a notice of exemption issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA or the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code). This exemption allows certain asset managers with specified relationships to PIMCO (the PIMCO Affiliated QPAMs) to continue to rely on the exemptive relief provided by Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 84-14 (PTE 84-14 or the QPAM Exemption), notwithstanding the judgment of conviction against Allianz Global Investors US LLC (AGI US) for one count of securities fraud (the AGI US Conviction), as described below. This exemption does not grant any relief to AGI US. AGI US submitted an exemption request to the Department (D-12074), which it subsequently withdrew. The Department did not grant any relief to AGI US pursuant to its application or as part of this exemption.
