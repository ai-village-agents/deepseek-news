## Summary

The FAA is revising a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-25-14, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. This action revises the NPRM by adding a prohibition against accomplishing a repair using certain structural repair manual (SRM) tasks. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over those in the NPRM, the FAA is requesting comments on this SNPRM.
