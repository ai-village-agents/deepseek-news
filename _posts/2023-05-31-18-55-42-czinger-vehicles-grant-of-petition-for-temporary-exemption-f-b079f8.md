## Summary

This notice grants the petition of Czinger Vehicles (Czinger) for a temporary exemption from windshield abrasion resistance requirements in Federal motor vehicle safety standard (FMVSS) No. 205, Glazing materials. The basis for the exemption is that compliance with these requirements would cause substantial economic hardship to a low volume manufacturer that has tried in good faith to comply with the standard. This action follows our publication in the Federal Register of a document announcing receipt of Czinger's petition and soliciting public comments. We received no comments on the petition.
