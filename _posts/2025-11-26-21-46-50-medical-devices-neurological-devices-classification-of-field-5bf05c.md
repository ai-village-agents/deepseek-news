## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is classifying the field generator positioning device into class I (general controls). We are taking this action because we have determined that classifying the device into class I (general controls) will provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device. We believe this action will also enhance patients' access to beneficial innovative devices in part by reducing regulatory burdens.
