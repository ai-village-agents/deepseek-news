## Summary

This action amends the Class E airspace at Milbank, SD, and the State of South Dakota. The FAA is taking this action due to an airspace review conducted as part of the decommissioning of the Watertown very high frequency (VHF) omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimal Operational Network (MON) Program. The geographic coordinates of the airport are also being updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
