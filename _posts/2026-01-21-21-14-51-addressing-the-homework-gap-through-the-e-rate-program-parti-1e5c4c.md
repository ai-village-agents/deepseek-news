## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission or FCC) reconsiders the E-Rate Wi-Fi hotspot and services rules adopted in July 2024. Specifically, the Commission grants the petition for reconsideration filed by Maurine and Matthew Molak and finds that the best reading of section 254 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, (the Communications Act) is that it does not permit funding of off-premises use of Wi-Fi hotspots and the associated wireless internet services with E-Rate program support. In so finding, the Commission rescinds the rules adopted in July 2024. The Commission also denies the two remaining petitions for reconsideration of the Commission's 2024 Hotspots Order. Consistent with the reconsideration, the Commission also withdraws two amendatory instructions published in the Federal Register, but delayed indefinitely.
