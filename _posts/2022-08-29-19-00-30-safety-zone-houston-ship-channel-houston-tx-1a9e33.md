## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for navigable waters within a 1,000 foot radius of the deadship tow of the Battleship Texas while it transits from its current location at San Jacinto Park on the Houston Ship Channel to its drydock location on the Galveston Channel. The safety zone is needed to ensure the safety of other waterway users. Entry of vessels or persons into this zone is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port Houston-Galveston. Tug and barge traffic will be authorized to transit through the safety zone in the barge lanes, with no meeting or overtaking of other tug and barge traffic, with Vessel Traffic Service approval.
