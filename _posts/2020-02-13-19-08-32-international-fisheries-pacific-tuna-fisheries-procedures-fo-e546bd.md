## Summary

On December 20, 2019, NMFS published a final rule under the Tuna Conventions Act of 1950 (TCA), as amended, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), as amended, to implement International Maritime Organization (IMO) requirements in Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) Resolution C-18-06 (Resolution (Amended) on a Regional Vessel Register) and amendments to existing regulations governing inclusion on the IATTC Regional Vessel Register (Vessel Register) by purse seine vessels fishing in the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO). The December 20th final rule inadvertently contained provisions allowing for the collection of a ``business email address'' without Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act. This amendment is necessary to correct those two revised collection-of-information requirements, because they became effective before approval by OMB.
