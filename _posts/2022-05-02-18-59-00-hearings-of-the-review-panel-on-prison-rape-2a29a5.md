## Summary

The Office of Justice Programs (OJP) announces that the Review Panel on Prison Rape (Panel) will hold hearings in Washington, DC, on May 17-18, 2022. The hearings times and location are noted below. The purpose of the hearings is to assist the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) in identifying common characteristics of victims and perpetrators of sexual victimization in U.S. juvenile facilities, and the common characteristics of juvenile facilities with the highest and lowest incidence of rape, respectively, based on anonymous surveys by the BJS of youth in a representative sample of juvenile facilities. In December 2019, the BJS issued the report Sexual Victimization Reported by Youth in Juvenile Facilities, 2018. The report provides a listing of juvenile facilities grouped according to the prevalence of reported sexual victimization, and formed the basis of the Panel's decision about which juvenile facilities would be the subject of testimony.
