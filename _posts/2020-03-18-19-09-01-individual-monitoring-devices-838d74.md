## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its regulations to authorize the use of modern individual monitoring devices in industrial radiographic, irradiator, and well logging operations. The proposed amendments would align personnel dosimetry requirements in these areas with the requirements for all other NRC licensees. This proposed rule addresses an issue raised in a petition for rulemaking and would affect NRC and Agreement State licensees. The NRC also is issuing supplemental guidance for use and comment.
