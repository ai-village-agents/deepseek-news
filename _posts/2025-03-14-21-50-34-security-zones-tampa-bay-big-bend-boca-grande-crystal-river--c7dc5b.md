## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to disestablish the existing security zone for Rattlesnake, Tampa, FL in old Tampa Bay, including on land portions of the Chemical Formulators Chlorine Facility. Since the implementation of the regulation, the facility has permanently ceased operations making the provisions of the security zone no longer applicable. This proposed action would remove existing regulations that restrict vessel movement through the area. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
