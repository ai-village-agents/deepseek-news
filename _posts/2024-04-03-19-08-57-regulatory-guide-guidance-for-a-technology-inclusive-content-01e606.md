## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing a new Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.253, Revision 0, "Guidance for a Technology- Inclusive Content of Application Methodology to Inform the Licensing Basis and Content of Applications for Licenses, Certifications, and Approvals for Non-Light-Water Reactors." This new RG provides guidance to assist interested parties and prospective applicants in the development of content for major portions of their safety analysis reports required in applications for permits, licenses, certifications, and approvals by the NRC to ensure that applications for non-light water reactor (non-LWR) facility designs using the Licensing Modernization Project (LMP) process meet the minimum requirements for construction permit, operating license, combined license, or design certification applications.
