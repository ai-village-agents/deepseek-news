## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is announcing a virtual-only public workshop entitled "Lessons Learned From the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) Development and Readiness Pilot (CDRP) Program." This workshop fulfills a commitment in the seventh authorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA VII) to hold a public meeting to discuss best practices and lessons learned from this pilot program. Convened by the Duke-Robert J.
