## Summary

The Farm Service Agency (FSA) is announcing the extension of the Application Fast Track (AFT) pilot program that was published August 3, 2023 (88 FR 51260-51265), and extended September 30, 2024 (89 FR 79504), which continues the expedited processing of qualified direct Operating Loans (OL) and Farm Ownership Loans (FO) to family farmers and ranchers. AFT has been available to all customers nationwide since January 1, 2024. AFT is being extended to allow for an expanded number of applicants that qualify for AFT and to allow FSA time to make the program permanent through publication of a final rule. FSA will see the pilot run until December 31, 2026 or until the aforementioned final rule is published, whichever is sooner. This will allow time for FSA to continue to evaluate the administrative effectiveness of AFT while drafting the final rule. The initial results of AFT reflect a significant improvement in processing times for all customers, and FSA is continuing to monitor loan performance, and overall satisfaction with the AFT pilot program from both customers and staff.
