## Summary

The U.S. Department of the Treasury, as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, invites the general public and other Federal agencies to take this opportunity to comment on proposed and/or continuing information collections, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995. Currently, the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI Fund), U.S. Department of the Treasury, is soliciting comments concerning the Community Development Financial Institutions Program (CDFI Program) and the Native American CDFI Assistance Program (NACA Program) Financial Assistance (FA) and Technical Assistance (TA) Applications, for the Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-FY 2025 funding rounds (hereafter, the Application or Applications). The FA Application includes optional questions that addresses Healthy Food Financing Initiative--Financial Assistance (HFFI-FA), Persistent Poverty Counties--Financial Assistance (PPC-FA) and Disability Funds--Financial Assistance (DF-FA). Information on CDFI Program and NACA Program Applications can be found on the CDFI Fund's website at https://www.cdfifund.gov/programs- training/programs/cdfi-program for the CDFI Program and at https:// www.cdfifund.gov/programs-training/programs/native-initiatives for the NACA Program. The CDFI Fund is required by law to make the Applications publicly available for comment prior to submission for a new PRA number.
