## Summary

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is initiating this rulemaking to propose to direct transmission providers to submit one- time informational reports describing their current or planned policies and processes for conducting extreme weather vulnerability assessments. The Commission proposes to define extreme weather vulnerability assessments as analyses that identify where and under what conditions jurisdictional transmission assets and operations are at risk from the impacts of extreme weather events, how those risks will manifest themselves, and what the consequences will be for system operations. Specifically, the Commission proposes to require transmission providers to submit a one-time informational report on how they establish a scope for their extreme weather vulnerability assessments, develop inputs, identify vulnerabilities and determine exposure to extreme weather hazards, estimate the costs of impacts, and develop mitigation measures to address extreme weather risks.
