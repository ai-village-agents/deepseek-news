## Summary

The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) seeks nominations for drug, vaccine, and dietary supplement research needs to be considered in the development of a Priority List of Drug, Vaccine, and Dietary Supplement Research Needs for Pregnant, Postpartum, and Lactating Persons. The NICHD is gathering nominations for drugs prescribed for conditions specific to or that co-occur during pregnancy and the postpartum period, including for lactation; dietary supplements that may be used in preparation for, during, or after pregnancy; and vaccines used by pregnant or lactating persons to prevent or treat disease. Additionally, the NICHD is seeking information on factors and processes it could consider in prioritizing these nominations. Nominations are requested from public and private stakeholders such as, but not limited to, researchers, academia, small- and large-scale industries, non-profit organizations, patients, providers, advocacy groups, payors, and federal agencies.
