## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is granting Michigan final authorization for changes to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The Agency published a proposed rule on December 13, 2021 and provided for public comment. One comment was submitted by the State of Michigan in which the State identified a rule that was part of their application for authorization that was not addressed in the proposed authorization. EPA acknowledges this oversight and will address this rule in a future action.
