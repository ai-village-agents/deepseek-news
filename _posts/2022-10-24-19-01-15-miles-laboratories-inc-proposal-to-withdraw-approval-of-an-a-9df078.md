## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA or Agency) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) is proposing to withdraw approval of an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) for Alcohol and Dextrose Injection, 5 milliliters (mL)/100 mL, 5 grams (g)/100 mL, and is announcing an opportunity for the ANDA holder to request a hearing on this proposal: Miles Laboratories Inc., P.O. Box 1986, 4th and Parker St., Berkeley, CA 94701, is the last holder of record. The bases for the proposal are that the ANDA holder has repeatedly failed to file required annual reports for this ANDA and that the Agency has scientific data and experience to show that the drug product under this ANDA is unsafe for use under the conditions of use for which the product was approved.
