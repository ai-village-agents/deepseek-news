## Summary

Effective with the February 2023 release of CPI data for January 2023, BLS will update weights annually for the Consumer Price Index based on a single calendar year of data, using consumer expenditure data from 2021. This change impacts the CPI for urban consumers (CPI-U), wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W), initial and interim versions of the Chained CPI-U, and CPI research series. This reflects a change from prior practice of updating weights biennially using two years of expenditure data. This shift will result in changes to some documents available from CPI, including the CPI Relative Importance tables Report and CPI Handbook of Methods.
