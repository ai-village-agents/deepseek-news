## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has issued the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Proposed Energy Conservation Standards for Manufactured Housing (DOE/EIS-0550).

DOE invites interested parties to comment on how analysis presented in the Draft EIS should inform the final energy conservation standards for manufactured housing.
