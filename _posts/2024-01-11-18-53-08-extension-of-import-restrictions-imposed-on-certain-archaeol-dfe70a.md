## Summary

This document amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regulations to extend import restrictions on certain archaeological material from China. The Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States Department of State, has made the requisite determinations for extending the import restrictions, which were originally imposed by CBP Dec. 09-03 and last extended by CBP Dec. 19-02. Accordingly, these import restrictions will remain in effect for an additional five years, and the CBP regulations are being amended to reflect this further extension through January 14, 2029.
