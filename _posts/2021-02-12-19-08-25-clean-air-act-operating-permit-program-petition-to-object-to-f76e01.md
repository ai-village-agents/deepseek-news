## Summary

Pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator signed an Order, dated July 15, 2020, partially granting and partially denying a petition to object to a state operating permit issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Environment Protection (PADEP). The Order responds to a January 8, 2020 petition, relating to Northampton Generating Co., LP's Northampton Plant (Northampton), an electric utility generation facility located in Northampton County, Pennsylvania. The petition was submitted by the Sierra Club and the Clean Air Council. This Order constitutes final action on that petition requesting that the Administrator object to the issuance of the proposed CAA title V permit.
