## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Gulfstream Aerospace LP Model Galaxy airplanes and Model Gulfstream 200 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports that wing flap fairing debonding and corrosion were discovered at certain areas of the lower skin on both wings. This AD requires an inspection for corrosion in certain areas of the wing skin fairings, additional inspections if necessary, resealing the fairings with new fillet seal, and applicable corrective actions, as specified in a Civil Aviation Authority of Israel (CAAI) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
