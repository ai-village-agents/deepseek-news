## Summary

As part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork burdens, and as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), the Surface Transportation Board (Board) gives notice of its intent to request from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) emergency approval for an existing collection without an OMB Control Number, as described below. If granted, the emergency approval is only valid for up to 180 days. If necessary, the Board will follow this emergency request with a submission for a 3-year approval through OMB's normal PRA clearance process.
