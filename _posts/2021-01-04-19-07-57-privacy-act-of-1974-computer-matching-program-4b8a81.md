## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is providing notice of a reestablished computer matching program between FNS and the State agencies that administer the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The matching program allows State agencies access to the Electronic Disqualified Recipient System (eDRS), a national database operated by FNS. The system maintains records of SNAP disqualifications imposed by State agencies on individuals who have been found to have committed an intentional program violation (IPV). State agencies need access to nationwide disqualification information to meet program integrity requirements because a disqualification in any State applies to SNAP nationally. Matches against eDRS enhance program integrity by providing State agencies assistance in determining eligibility for SNAP benefits and the proper disqualification length when imposing a new disqualification.
