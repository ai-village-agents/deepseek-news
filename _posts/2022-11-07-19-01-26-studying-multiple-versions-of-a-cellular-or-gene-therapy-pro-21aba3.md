## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance entitled "Studying Multiple Versions of a Cellular or Gene Therapy Product in an Early-Phase Clinical Trial; Guidance for Industry." The guidance document provides recommendations to sponsors interested in studying multiple versions of a cellular or gene therapy product in an early phase clinical trial for a single disease. Sponsors have expressed interest in gathering preliminary evidence of safety and activity using multiple versions of a cellular or gene therapy product in a single clinical trial, where each version of the product is distinct and is generally submitted to FDA in a separate investigational new drug application (IND). The guidance provides recommendations for conducting such studies, including how to organize and structure the INDs, submit new information, and report adverse events. The guidance announced in this notice finalizes the draft guidance of the same title dated September 2021.
