## Summary

On January 2, 2024, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) initiated the first sunset reviews of the antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on rubber bands from the People's Republic of China (China) and the AD order on rubber bands from Thailand. Because no domestic interested party filed a timely notice of intent to participate in these sunset reviews, Commerce is revoking the AD and CVD orders on rubber bands from the China and the AD order on rubber bands from Thailand.
