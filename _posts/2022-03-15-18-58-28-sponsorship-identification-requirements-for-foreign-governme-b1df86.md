## Summary

In this document, the Commission announces that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved two information collections associated with rules governing sponsorship identification requirements for foreign government-provided programming in the 2021 Report and Order, FCC 21-42, in MB Docket No. 20-299. The Commission also announces that compliance with the rules is now required. It removes a paragraph in the adopted rules advising that compliance was not required until OMB approval was obtained. This document is consistent with the 2021 Report and Order, which states the Commission will publish a document in the Federal Register announcing a compliance date for the rule sections and revise the rules accordingly.
