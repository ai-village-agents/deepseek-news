## Summary

The NMFS West Coast Region is publishing this Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for the proposed identification of one or more Aquaculture Opportunity Areas (AOAs) to be located in Federal waters off the coast of Southern California. An AOA is considered to be a defined geographic area that has been evaluated to determine its potential suitability for commercial aquaculture. The proposed action is a planning initiative only and does not propose any aquaculture facilities or permits. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Los Angeles District, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) District Eleven, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 9 will act as cooperating agencies for the purposes of the PEIS.
