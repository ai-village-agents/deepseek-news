## Summary

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) seeks public comment on the Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance (OVSC) laboratory test procedure (TP) number TP-213-11, specifically relating to FMVSS No. 213a, Child restraint systems--side impact protection. This TP, prepared for the limited purpose of use by contracted independent laboratories conducting tests for NHTSA, is an agency guidance document intended for use by NHTSA test contractors. TPs are not rules, regulations, or agency interpretations regarding the meaning of a Federal motor vehicle safety standard. The TP serves as a contractual document between NHTSA and its contract test laboratories. The updated OVSC laboratory test procedure, TP-213-11, includes new instructions for how labs should test for compliance with the recently created FMVSS No. 213a, Child restraint systems--side impact protection.
