## Summary

This action proposes to amend Class E surface airspace and Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Edward F. Knapp State Park, Montpelier, VT, due to the decommissioning of the Mount Mansfield non-directional beacon (NDB) and cancellation of associated approaches, as well as updating the airport's geographic coordinates. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.
