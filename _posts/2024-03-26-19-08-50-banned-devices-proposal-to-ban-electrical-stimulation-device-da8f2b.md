# Banned Devices; Proposal To Ban Electrical Stimulation Devices for Self-Injurious or Aggressive Behavior

## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is proposing to ban electrical stimulation devices (ESDs) intended for self-injurious behavior (SIB) or aggressive behavior (AB). FDA has determined these devices present an unreasonable and substantial risk of illness or injury that cannot be corrected or eliminated by labeling. This proposal follows a court decision vacating a prior ban and amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act clarifying our authority to ban a device for one or more intended uses. This action, if finalized, will mean ESDs for SIB and AB are adulterated and not legally marketed.
