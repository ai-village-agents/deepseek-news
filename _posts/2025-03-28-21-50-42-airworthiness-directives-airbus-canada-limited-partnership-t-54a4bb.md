## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500- 1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a design review that found insufficient clearance between fire extinguishing system (FIREX) lines and certain fasteners in the center mid-fuselage area. This AD requires an inspection for positioning and sufficient clearance of certain fasteners in certain fuselage and keel beam areas, an inspection for damage of the fire extinguishing lines, and applicable corrective actions, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
