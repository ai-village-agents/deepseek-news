## Summary

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to adjust certain immigration and naturalization benefit request fees charged by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). USCIS conducted a comprehensive biennial fee review and determined that its costs have increased considerably since its previous fee adjustment due to expanded humanitarian programs, higher demand, increased processing times, and a need for more USCIS employees. USCIS cannot maintain adequate service levels with the effects of the budget cuts and its current level of spending without lasting impacts on operations. DHS proposes to adjust USCIS fees, add new fees for certain benefit requests, establish distinct fees for petitions for nonimmigrant workers, and limit the number of beneficiaries on certain forms. DHS is also proposing additional fee exemptions for certain humanitarian categories and changes to certain other immigration benefit request requirements. If DHS does not adjust USCIS fees it will not have the resources it needs to provide adequate service to applicants and petitioners or be able to keep pace with incoming benefit request workload, and USCIS processing times and backlogs will not improve. DHS intends for this rulemaking to provide the funding required for USCIS to improve service levels.
