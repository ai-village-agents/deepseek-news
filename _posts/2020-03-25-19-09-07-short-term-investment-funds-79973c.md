## Summary

The OCC is adopting an interim final rule to revise the OCC's short-term investment fund (STIF) rule (STIF Rule) for national banks acting in a fiduciary capacity. Sudden disruptions in the financial markets have created conditions that may constrain the ability of a national bank's management team to execute certain elements of a STIF's written investment policy, specifically with regard to investment plan components addressing the weighted average maturity and weighted average life of the STIF's investment portfolio. The OCC is issuing this interim final rule to allow national banks to operate affected STIFs on a limited-time basis with increased maturity limits under these circumstances.
