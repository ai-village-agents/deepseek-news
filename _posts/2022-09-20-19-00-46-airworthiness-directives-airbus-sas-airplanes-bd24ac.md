## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2016-16-06, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A300 B4-603, B4- 605R, and B4-622R airplanes; and Model A310-304, -324, and -325 airplanes. AD 2016-16-06 requires inspections around the rivet heads of the seal retainer run-out holes at certain frames and corrective actions if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2016-16-06, a determination was made that additional frames may also be susceptible to cracking, and that additional airplanes may be affected by the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2016-16-06 and add airplanes, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
