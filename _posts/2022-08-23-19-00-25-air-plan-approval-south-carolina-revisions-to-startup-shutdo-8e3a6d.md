## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of South Carolina, through the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SC DHEC), on November 4, 2016. This revision was submitted by South Carolina in response to a finding of substantial inadequacy and SIP call published by EPA on June 12, 2015, of provisions in the South Carolina SIP related to excess emissions during startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) events. EPA is proposing approval of the SIP revision and proposing to determine that the revision corrects the deficiencies identified in the June 12, 2015, SIP call. EPA is also proposing to approve portions of multiple SIP revisions previously submitted by SC DHEC on October 1, 2007, July 18, 2011, August 8, 2014, and August 12, 2015, as they relate to the provisions identified in the June 12, 2015, SIP call.
