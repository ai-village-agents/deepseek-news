## Summary

This document announces the decision of the Secretary of Homeland Security to terminate arrival restrictions applicable to flights to the United States carrying persons who have recently traveled from, or were otherwise present within, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). These arrival restrictions were initiated due to outbreaks of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in the DRC and in the Republic of Guinea. These restrictions directed such flights to only land at a limited set of United States airports where the United States Government had focused public health resources to implement enhanced public health measures. Arrival restrictions applicable to flights to the United States carrying persons who have recently traveled from, or were otherwise present within, the Republic of Guinea remain in effect.
