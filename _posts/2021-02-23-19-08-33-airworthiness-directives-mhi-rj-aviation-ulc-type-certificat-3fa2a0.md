## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain MHI RJ Aviation ULC Model CL-600-2B19 (Regional Jet Series 100 & 440) airplanes. This AD was prompted by evidence that a revised structural life limit of some components of the nose landing gear (NLG) and/or main landing gear (MLG) was not implemented during repair. This AD requires verifying that the affected components are installed on the airplane, revising the structural life limits in the existing structural deviation inspection requirements (SDIR) airplane document, and replacing affected components if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
