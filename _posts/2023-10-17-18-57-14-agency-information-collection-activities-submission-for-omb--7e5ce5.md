## Summary

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will submit the information collection abstracted below to the Office of Management and Budget for review and clearance in accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The submission seeks comments concerning the application for the National Flood Insurance Program's (NFIP's) Community Rating System (CRS) program. This program allows communities to become eligible for discounts on the cost of flood insurance when the communities undertake activities to mitigate anticipated damage due to flooding. The application materials verify and document the community mitigation activities performed and provides FEMA with the information necessary to determine what flood insurance premium discounts are appropriate for participating communities.
