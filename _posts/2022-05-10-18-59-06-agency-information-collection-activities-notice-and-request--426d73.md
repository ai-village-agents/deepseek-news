## Summary

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) invites public comments about our intention to request approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for an extension of a currently approved information collection. Before a federal agency may collect certain information from the public, it must receive approval from OMB. Under procedures established by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, before seeking OMB approval, Federal agencies must solicit public comment on proposed collections of information, including extensions and reinstatements of previously approved collections. This document describes a collection of information for which NHTSA intends to seek OMB extension approval, titled "Heavy Vehicle Crash Avoidance Systems" and identified by OMB Control Number 2127-0741, which is currently approved through August 31, 2022. This project has been delayed due to COVID-19 shutdowns and precautions. The extension is necessary to continue the current data collection to completion. This extension request updates the burden hours to reflect the numbers of respondents that are needed to complete the study, updates to time estimates for responses, and mean hourly rates. Additionally, this notice provides clarification on the burden hours and the costs to the public.
