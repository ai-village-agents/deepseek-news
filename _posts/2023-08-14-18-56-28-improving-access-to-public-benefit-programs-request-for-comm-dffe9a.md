## Summary

On July 13, 2023, the Department of Housing and Urban Development published in the Federal Register a document titled "Improving Access to Public Benefit Programs; Request for Comment." The request for comment seeks comments from the public regarding the burden faced when applying for or maintaining eligibility for HUD's housing programs. HUD recognizes that these administrative hurdles and paperwork burdens disproportionately fall on the most vulnerable populations and prevent individuals and entities from accessing benefits for which they are legally eligible. The request for comment provided for a 30-day comment period, which would have ended on August 14, 2023. HUD has determined that a 30-day extension of the comment period, until September 13, 2023, is appropriate to allow interested persons additional time to provide responses. Public comment submitted in response to the request for comment will assist HUD in better understanding, identifying, and reducing HUD's public program administrative burden and ultimately further its mission to pursue transformative housing and community-building policies and programs.
