## Summary

This action proposes to amend Class E surface airspace and Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface in Greenville, NC, as new instrument approach procedures have been designed for ECU Health Medical Center Heliport, Greenville, NC, and evaluations of existing Class E airspace determined modification were needed. The Class E airspaces for Pitt-Greenville Airport will have increases in the radii as well as establishing an extension to the northeast. Also, this action would establish Class E airspace for ECU Health Medical Center Heliport. In addition, this action would make the editorial chance replacing the term Notice to Airmen with Notice to Air Missions in the legal description.
