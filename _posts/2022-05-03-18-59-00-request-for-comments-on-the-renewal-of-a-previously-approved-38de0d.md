## Summary

The Maritime Administration (MARAD) invites public comments on our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves documenting shipments made during the life of certain EXIM Bank financed projects. The information to be collected is necessary for MARAD to fulfill its legislative requirement to monitor the percentage of ocean freight revenues/tonnage. We are required to publish this notice in the Federal Register by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
