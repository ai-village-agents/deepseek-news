## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to provisionally renew a New Prime, Inc., (Prime) exemption from the provisions that require a commercial learner's permit (CLP) holder to be accompanied by a commercial driver's license (CDL) holder with the proper CDL class and endorsements seated in the front seat of the vehicle while the CLP holder performs behind-the-wheel training on public roads or highways. The exemption allows a CLP holder who has passed the skills test but not yet received the CDL document to drive a Prime commercial motor vehicle (CMV) accompanied by a CDL holder who is not necessarily in the passenger seat, provided the driver has documentation of passing the skills test. The exemption renewal is for 5 years.
