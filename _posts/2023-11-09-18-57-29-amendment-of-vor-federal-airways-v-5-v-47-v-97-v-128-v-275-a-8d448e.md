## Summary

This action proposes to amend Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-5, V-47, V-97, V-128, V- 275, and V-517, and United States Area Navigation (RNAV) route T-315, and revoke VOR Federal airway V-19. The FAA is proposing this action due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Cincinnati, KY (CVG), VOR/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) navigational aid (NAVAID). The Cincinnati VOR is being decommissioned in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
