## Summary

TF Cibolo Canyons, LP (applicant) has applied to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) for an amendment to their existing incidental take permit (ITP) supported by the proposed amendment to the Habitat Conservation Plan for a portion of the Cibolo Canyon Property (Master Phase II) (HCP) pursuant to the Endangered Species Act. The requested amendment to the ITP, if approved, would continue authorization of incidental take of the golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia). The application package includes the proposed changes to the HCP and a draft screening form that has been prepared to evaluate the ITP application in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. We invite the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies to comment on these documents.
