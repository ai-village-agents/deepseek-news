# Special Conditions: Airbus Model A321neo XLR Airplanes; Flight Envelope Protection, Icing and Non-Icing Conditions; High Incidence Protection.

## Summary

This action proposes special conditions for the Airbus Model A321neo XLR airplane. The airplane will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport-category airplanes. This design feature is associated with flight-envelope protections, in icing and non-icing conditions, that use high-incidence protection and an alpha- floor system to automatically advance throttles when the airplane angle of attack reaches a predetermined value. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
