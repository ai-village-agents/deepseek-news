## Summary

The Administration for Community Living (ACL) within The Department of Health and Human Services ("the Department" or HHS) is issuing this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to modernize the implementing regulations of the Older Americans Act of 1965 ("the Act" or OAA), which have not been substantially altered since their promulgation in 1988. These changes advance the policy goals of the Older Americans Act as articulated by Congress, including equity in service delivery, accountability for funds expended, and clarity of administration for the Administration for Community Living and its grantees. Our proposals will ultimately facilitate improved service delivery and enhanced benefits for OAA participants, particularly those in greatest economic need and greatest social need consistent with the statute.
