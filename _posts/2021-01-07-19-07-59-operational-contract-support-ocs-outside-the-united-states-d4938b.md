## Summary

The DoD is issuing this rule to update the policies and procedures for operational contract support (OCS) outside the United States. These changes include broadening the range of applicable operational scenarios, eliminating content internal to the Department, and making updates to comply with law and policy. Changes include designating contractor personnel as part of the DoD total force, incorporating requirements for accountability and reporting, and clarifying responsibilities. Through these updates, the Department will also address open recommendations from the Government Accountability Office (GAO). OCS is a segment of the GAO High Risk Area of DoD Contract Management and while the latest update in March 2019 acknowledged progress, GAO cited the need to revise and reissue guidance to address several open recommendations.
