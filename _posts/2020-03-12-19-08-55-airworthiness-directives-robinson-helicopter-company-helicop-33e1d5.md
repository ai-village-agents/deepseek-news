## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Robinson Helicopter Company Model R44 and R44 II helicopters with an agricultural spray system installed by Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) SR00286BO (spray system). This spray system is also known as a Simplex Manufacturing Company (Simplex) Model 244 spray system. This AD was prompted by a report of an in-flight failure of the spray system elbow pump fitting (pump fitting). This AD requires repetitive inspections of the spray system pump fitting, corrective action if necessary, replacement of the spray system pump fitting, and installation of hose supports and a pump outlet cover. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
