## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) permanently debarring Gregory Settino from providing services in any capacity to a person that has an approved or pending drug product application. FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Settino was convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct that relates to the regulation of any drug product under the FD&C Act. Mr. Settino was given notice of the proposed permanent debarment and was given an opportunity to request a hearing to show why he should not be debarred. As of August 15, 2022 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Mr. Settino had not responded. Mr. Settino's failure to respond and request a hearing within the prescribed timeframe constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this action.
