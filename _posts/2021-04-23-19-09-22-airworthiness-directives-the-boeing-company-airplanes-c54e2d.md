## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 737-100, -200, -200C, -300, -400, and -500 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by crack indications found in the lower aft wing skin bolt holes where the flap tracks attach to the track support fitting. This AD requires repetitive inspections for cracking of the left and right wing, lower aft wing skin aft edge, at certain flap track locations, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
