## Summary

On July 7, 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE" or "the Department") published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking ("NOPR") for amending the energy conservation standards for certain consumer furnaces, specifically non-weatherized gas furnaces ("NWGF") and mobile home gas furnaces ("MHGF"). In response to requests by several interested parties, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is making available a revised version of the life- cycle-cost ("LCC") spreadsheet supporting that NOPR and also announcing a public meeting webinar to assist stakeholders with operation of the LCC spreasheet. In addition, DOE received four requests to extend the public comment period for the NOPR (originally set to close September 6, 2022), and after considering those requests, the Department has decided to extend the public comment period until October 6, 2022.
