## Summary

In this request for comments, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO or Office) seeks public input on the requirements to practice before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB or Board). The Office seeks to ensure quality representation in PTAB proceedings under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA) without creating undue restrictions or barriers to entry for practitioners wishing to appear before the PTAB. The Office's goal is to expand the admission criteria to practice before the PTAB so more Americans, including those from traditionally under-represented and under-resourced communities, can participate in Office practice, while maintaining the Office's high standards necessary for the issuance and maintenance of robust and reliable intellectual property rights.
