## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC" or "Commission"), with the concurrence of the Office of Government Ethics ("OGE"), is jointly issuing with OGE this proposed rule for Commission members and employees. This proposed rule would amend the existing Supplemental Standards of Ethical Conduct for Members and Employees of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("Supplemental Standards") jointly issued by SEC and OGE, would supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (OGE Standards) issued by OGE, and is necessary and appropriate to address ethical issues unique to the SEC. The Commission is proposing to revise transaction and reporting requirements for certain assets that pose a low risk of conflicts of interest or appearance concerns, and to prohibit employee ownership of sector funds that have a stated policy of concentrating their investments in entities directly regulated by the Commission. Further, the Commission proposes to authorize collection of covered securities transactions and holdings data from financial institutions through a third-party automated compliance system. The Commission also proposes to correct certain technical matters and adjust its transaction and reporting requirements to provide the flexibility necessary to implement a third-party automated compliance system.
