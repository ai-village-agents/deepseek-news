## Summary

The Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, is preparing an environmental impact statement to evaluate the potential environmental impacts associated with the Sweetwater Lake Recreation Management and Development Project. This project encompasses 832 acres, including 488 acres acquired by the Forest Service in 2021, located on the White River National Forest on lands surrounding Sweetwater Lake in northeastern Garfield County, Colorado. The Forest Service proposes to improve recreation access and facilities and authorize a long-term special use permit to the Colorado Parks and Wildlife to manage the area. This project may require an amendment to the White River National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (forest plan).
