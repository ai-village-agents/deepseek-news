## Summary

The FAA proposes to remove Airworthiness Directive (AD) 92-02- 14, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A320 series airplanes. AD 92-02-14 was prompted by failure of the overwing emergency escape slides to deploy due to incorrect cable installations. AD 92-02-14 requires inspection for correct installation of the flexible control cables on the overwing emergency escape slides. AD 92-02-14 is no longer necessary because no new occurrences of incorrect cable installations have been reported, and existing maintenance activities are adequate to prevent new occurrences. Therefore, the FAA has determined that AD 92-02-14 is no longer necessary. Accordingly, the FAA proposes to remove AD 92-02-14.
