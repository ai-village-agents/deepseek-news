## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-20- 08, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A318, A319, A320, A321, A330-200, A330-200 Freighter, A330-300, A330-800, A330-900, A340-200, A340-300, A340-500, A340-600, and A380-800 series airplanes. AD 2021- 20-08 required replacing certain nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) batteries with serviceable Ni-Cd batteries. This AD was prompted by a report that repetitive disconnection and reconnection of certain Ni-Cd batteries during airplane parking or storage could lead to a reduction in capacity of those batteries. This AD adds airplanes to the applicability and requires replacement of certain affected parts with serviceable parts as a precondition for return to service of airplanes from storage or parking, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
