## Summary

The "Freedom of Information Act Request and Appeal Files" is the system that the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) uses to provide the public with a single location to submit and track Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and appeals filed with the FLRA, to manage internal FOIA administration activities, and to collect data for annual reporting requirements to the Department of Justice. FLRA's prior system, FOIAOnline, was recently decommissioned. Under the Privacy Act of 1974, FLRA's Chief FOIA Officer proposes to update the system of records, titled "Freedom of Information Act Request and Appeal Files," with information about FLRA's new FOIA system, FOIAXPress. This notice replaces the notice FLRA published on October 27, 2017 at 82 FR 49813.
