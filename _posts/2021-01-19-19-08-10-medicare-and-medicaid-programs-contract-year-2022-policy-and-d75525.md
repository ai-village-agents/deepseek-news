## Summary

This final rule will revise regulations for the Medicare Advantage (Part C) program, Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Part D) program, Medicaid program, Medicare Cost Plan program, and Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) to implement certain sections of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 and the Substance Use Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment--(SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act (hereinafter referred to as the SUPPORT Act), enhance the Part C and D programs and the PACE program, codify several existing CMS policies, make required statutory changes, implement other technical changes, and make routine updates. As stated in the final rule that appeared in the Federal Register on June 2, 2020, CMS is fulfilling its intention to address the remaining proposals from the February 2020 proposed rule here. Although the provisions adopted in this second final rule will be in effect during 2021, most provisions will apply to coverage beginning January 1, 2022. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for proposals from the February 2020 proposed rule that would codify statutory requirements that were already in effect prior to this rule's appearance in the Federal Register, CMS reminds organizations, plan sponsors, and other readers that the statutory provisions apply and will continue to be enforced. Similarly, for the proposals from the February 2020 proposed rule that would implement the statutory requirements in sections 2007 and 2008 of the SUPPORT Act, CMS intends to implement these statutory provisions consistent with their effective provisions.
