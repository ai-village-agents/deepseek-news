## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is notifying the public that we have received a CAA section 111(d)/129 negative declaration from Louisiana for existing incinerators subject to the Other Solid Waste Incineration units (OSWI) emission guidelines (EG). This negative declaration from Louisiana certifies that incinerators subject to the OSWI EG and the requirements of sections 111(d) and 129 of the CAA do not exist within the jurisdiction of Louisiana. The EPA is accepting the negative declaration and amending the agency regulations in accordance with the requirements of the CAA.
