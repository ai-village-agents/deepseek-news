## Summary

The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) published a Federal Register Notice on October 1, 2025, with proposed updates to the HRSA-supported Women's Preventive Services Guidelines (Guidelines). The proposed updates specifically relate to recommendations for Screening for Cervical Cancer. Recommendations to update the Guidelines are developed under a HRSA-funded cooperative agreement, the Women's Preventive Services Initiative (WPSI), for consideration by HRSA. Under this agreement, WPSI convenes expert health professionals to conduct rigorous reviews of the evidence following the National Academy of Medicine standards for establishing foundations for and rating strengths of recommendations, articulation of recommendations, and external reviews, and it developed draft recommendations for HRSA's consideration. After consideration of public comment, HRSA has accepted the recommendations as revised and detailed in this notice. Under applicable law, non- grandfathered group health plans and health insurance issuers offering non-grandfathered group and individual health insurance coverage must include coverage, without cost sharing, for certain preventive services, including those provided for in the HRSA-supported Guidelines. The Departments of Labor, HHS, and the Treasury have previously issued regulations describing how group health plans and health insurance issuers apply the coverage requirements.
