## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to take action pursuant to section 110 of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) on State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of Utah on July 3, 2019, as supplemented on December 3, 2019, to satisfy certain regional haze requirements for the program's first implementation period. The EPA is proposing to approve the July 2019 SIP revision that provides an alternative to best available retrofit technology (BART) controls for nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) at the PacifiCorp Hunter and Huntington power plants. The EPA proposes to find that the Utah NO<INF>X</INF> BART Alternative for Hunter and Huntington would provide greater reasonable progress toward natural visibility conditions than BART, in accordance with the requirements of the CAA and the EPA's Regional Haze Rule (RHR). In conjunction with this proposed approval, we propose to withdraw the federal implementation plan (FIP) that addresses NO<INF>X</INF> BART for the Hunter and Huntington power plants. The EPA also proposes to approve the December 3, 2019 SIP supplement that would require reporting of all deviations from compliance with the applicable requirements under BART and the BART Alternative, including the emission limits for Hunter and Huntington.
