## Summary

In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), this notice announces that the Information Collection Request (ICR) summarized below will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval. This document describes a new collection of information for which NHTSA intends to seek OMB approval titled "Motorcycle Crash Avoidance Technology Review." The new information collection would be a one-time, voluntary, and anonymous survey of motorcycle riders to obtain consumer-reported feedback and perspectives on the use and availability of advanced crash avoidance motorcycle technologies. A Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following information collection was published on June 12, 2024. Three comments were received during the comment period. This 30-day notice includes a summary of those comments and responses. NHTSA has addressed these comments, but there are no resulting changes to the estimated burden.
