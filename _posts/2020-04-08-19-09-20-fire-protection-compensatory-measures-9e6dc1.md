## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is denying Petition for Rulemaking (PRM)-50-115, "Petition for Rulemaking--Fire Protection Compensatory Measures," dated May 1, 2017, submitted by David Lochbaum and Paul Gunter (the petitioners) on behalf of the Union of Concerned Scientists and Beyond Nuclear, respectively. The petitioners request that the NRC issue regulations that establish acceptable conditions for the use of compensatory measures (e.g., fire watches, surveillance cameras) during periods when fire protection regulations are not met, as well as define the maximum duration that compensatory measures may be relied upon. The NRC staff concludes that the petitioners did not present sufficient new information or arguments to warrant the requested changes to the regulations in light of the NRC's relevant past decisions and current policies. Therefore, the NRC is denying PRM-50-115.
