## Summary

We are reopening the comment period and providing an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment to the Kentucky regulatory program (the "Kentucky program") under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). The comment period is being reopened to incorporate additional statutory and regulatory provisions that were not included in the original Kentucky submittal. The revised amendment includes legislative and regulatory actions regarding electronic service of enforcement documents, clarification of Kentucky's administrative hearings regulations, and miscellaneous minor, non-substantive changes. The amendment also includes reorganization and renumbering of the Kentucky Administrative Regulations. This document gives the times and locations that the Kentucky submittal is available for your inspection, the comment period during which you may submit written comments, and the procedures that we will follow for the public hearing, if one is requested.
