## Summary

Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on October 28, 2022, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of Lund Motion Products, Inc. of Brea, California. Supplements to the complaint were filed on November 14, 2022. The complaint, as supplemented, alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain automated retractable vehicle steps and components thereof by reason of the infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 9,272,667 ("the '667 patent); U.S. Patent No. 9,527,449 ("the '449 Patent"); U.S. Patent No. 9,511,717 ("the '717 Patent"); and U.S. Patent No. 11,198,395 ("the '395 patent"). The complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The complainant requests that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a general exclusion order, or in the alternative a limited exclusion order, and cease and desist orders.
