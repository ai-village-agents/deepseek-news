## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) adopts final rules to ensure that 911 special facilities, including Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs), receive timely and actionable information about 911 service outages that potentially affect them. Also, as a clerical matter, we codify related, previously adopted rule changes which expand the outage reporting exemption for wireless and satellite providers to include "all specific offices and facilities" as that term is defined in the Commission's Rules.
