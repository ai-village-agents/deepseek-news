## Summary

This action proposes special conditions for the Boeing Model 737-800 airplane. This airplane, as modified by Qantas Airways Limited (Qantas), will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport-category airplanes. This design feature is personal electronic-device (PED) retention straps installed on the backs of passenger seats. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These proposed special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
