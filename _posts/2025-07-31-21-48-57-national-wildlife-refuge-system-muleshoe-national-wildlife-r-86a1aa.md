## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), withdraw the final Land Protection Plan (LPP) for the Muleshoe National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) approved on June 15, 2023. Hereafter, the Service will take no actions to acquire lands within the acquisition boundary created by the now withdrawn Muleshoe NWR LPP. The Service has determined that withdrawing the proposal is justified to support President Trump's Executive Order (E.O.) 14154 of January 20, 2025, "Unleashing American Energy." The withdrawal of the LPP will ensure America's lands continue to support energy development, agriculture production, and our local economies.
