# Airworthiness Directives; Leonardo S.p.a. Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Leonardo S.p.a. Model AB139 and AW139 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by multiple reports of cracks found on tail rotor (TR) damper bracket assemblies. This proposed AD would require accomplishing repetitive detailed visual inspections (DVIs) of certain part-numbered TR damper bracket assemblies for corrosion and cracks and, depending on the results, taking corrective action. This proposed AD would also prohibit installing an affected TR damper bracket assembly unless it is new. These actions are specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
