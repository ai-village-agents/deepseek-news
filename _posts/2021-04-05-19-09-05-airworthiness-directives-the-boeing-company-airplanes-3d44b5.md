## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-200 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports indicating that the pitot heat switch is not always set to ON, which could result in misleading air data. This AD requires replacement of pitot anti-icing system components, installation of a junction box and wiring provisions, repetitive testing of the anti- icing system, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
