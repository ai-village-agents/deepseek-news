## Summary

This action proposes to amend Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal Airways V-48, V-52, V-216, and V- 434, and revoke VOR Federal Airway V-206. The FAA is proposing this action due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Ottumwa, IA (OTM), VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) navigational aid (NAVAID). The Ottumwa VOR is being decommissioned in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
