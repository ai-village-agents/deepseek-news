## Summary

The Coast Guard announces that the Chief of Prevention Division, Seventh District has issued a certificate of alternative compliance from the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), for the M/V PELICAN II (O.N. 1296903). We are issuing this notice because its publication is required by statute. Due to the construction and placement of the masthead light, stern light, and sidelights, M/V PELICAN II cannot fully comply with the light, shape, or sound signal provisions of the 72 COLREGS without interfering with the vessel's design and construction. This notification of the issuance of these certificates of alternative compliance promotes the Coast Guard's marine safety mission.
