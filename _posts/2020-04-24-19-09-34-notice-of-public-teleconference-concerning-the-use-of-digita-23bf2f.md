## Summary

The U.S. Department of State (DOS) invites submission of comments from the public, academia, industry, and other stakeholders on the topic of "digital sequence information (DSI) on genetic resources," also known as genetic sequence data (GSD). The United States will use these comments to inform policy development and international messaging on GSD, particularly regarding the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the Nagoya Protocol. The Department will hold a public meeting and information session to discuss these issues, on May 14, 2020 at 10:00 a.m., by teleconference. This teleconference is in place of the postponed in-person public meeting on DSI originally scheduled for March 12, 2020 [Public Notice 11037].
