## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes to revise its regulations that govern VA's Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC). This rulemaking would propose improvements to PCAFC and would update the regulations to comply with the recent enactment of the VA MISSION Act of 2018, which made changes to the program's authorizing statute. These proposed changes would allow PCAFC to better address the needs of veterans of all eras and standardize the program to focus on eligible veterans with moderate and severe needs.
