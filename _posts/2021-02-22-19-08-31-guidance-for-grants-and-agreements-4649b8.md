## Summary

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is correcting the final guidance that appeared in the Federal Register on August 13, 2020. That document incorrectly cited specific sections or laws and inadvertently omitted specific language from the revisions. This amendment fixes citations and references and clarifies specific language.
