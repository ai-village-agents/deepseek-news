## Summary

On November 30, 2022, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) seeking input regarding ways to strengthen cybersecurity and resiliency in the pipeline and rail (including freight, passenger, and transit rail) sectors. The ANPRM solicited comment on specific questions, which would assist TSA in better understanding how the pipeline and rail sectors implement cyber risk management in their operations, support TSA in achieving objectives related to the enhancement of pipeline and rail cybersecurity, and help TSA develop a comprehensive and forward-looking approach to cybersecurity requirements. Through this document, TSA is extending the comment period by 15 calendar days to provide additional time for the public to provide comments.
