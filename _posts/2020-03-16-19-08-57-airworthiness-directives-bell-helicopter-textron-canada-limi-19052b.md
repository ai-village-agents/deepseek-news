## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bell Helicopter Textron Canada Limited (Bell Canada) Model 429 helicopters. This AD requires inspecting a certain part-numbered curvic coupling for proper engagement and depending on the inspection results, inspecting for play, inspecting the curvic coupling teeth, inspecting the flapping bearing teeth, replacing parts, performing a rigging check, and reporting information. This AD was prompted by a report of disengaged teeth of a curvic coupling due to improper installation. The actions of this AD are intended to address an unsafe condition on these products.
