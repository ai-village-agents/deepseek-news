## Summary

We are announcing 2023 fishing opportunities in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) Regulatory Area. This action is necessary to make fishing privileges in the NAFO Regulatory Area available on an equitable basis to the extent possible. The intended effect of this notice is to alert U.S. fishing vessels of the NAFO fishing opportunities for yellowtail flounder, redfish, and Illex squid, to relay the available quotas available to U.S. participants, and to outline the process and requirements for vessels to apply to participate in the 2023 NAFO fishery.
