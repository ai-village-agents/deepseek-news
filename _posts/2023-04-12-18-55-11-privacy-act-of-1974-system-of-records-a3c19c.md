## Summary

Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, notice is hereby given that the VA is modifying the system of records entitled, "National Patient Databases-VA" (121VA10A7). VA provides health care services to many of America's Veterans through the VHA. However, the care of America's Veterans extends beyond VHA and into community providers. During the course of providing health care, VHA collects medical and health information about Veterans under their care. Similarly, outside of VHA, community providers also collect medical and health information about Veterans under their care. This SORN requires modification to ensure the appropriate sharing of Veterans' medical or health information for disease management and population-based activities for improving health outcomes.
