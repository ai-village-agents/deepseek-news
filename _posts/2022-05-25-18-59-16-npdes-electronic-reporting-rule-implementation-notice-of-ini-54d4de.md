## Summary

This Federal Register document provides notice of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) approval of the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality as the initial recipient for electronic data reporting under the NPDES Electronic Reporting Rule ("NPDES eRule"), effective December 6, 2021, for all National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) data groups except for "No. 4--Sewage Sludge/Biosolids Annual Program Reports." Oregon Department of Environmental Quality cannot be the initial recipient for this data group as EPA is the authorized NPDES program for the Federal biosolids program.
