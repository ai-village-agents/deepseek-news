## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves voluntary reporting of bird/other wildlife strike information following a wildlife strike incident with aircraft. This data becomes part of the publicly available National Wildlife Strike Database. The information to be collected is necessary because it provides critical information that allows the FAA to determine high-risk species, track national trends, evaluate the FAA's wildlife hazard management program, and monitor compliance with Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 139, Section 139.337--Wildlife Hazard Management. Additionally, this essential information allows engine and airframe manufacturers to evaluate the effectiveness of aircraft components. It also helps airports identify and mitigate hazardous species and the location of wildlife attractants, affords a better understanding of strike dynamics, and provides key metrics for an airport to evaluate the effectiveness of its wildlife management program.
