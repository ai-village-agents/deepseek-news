## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, Agency, or we) received objections and requests for a hearing from the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) and Chobani, Inc. (Chobani) on the final rule titled "Milk and Cream Products and Yogurt Products; Final Rule To Revoke the Standards for Lowfat Yogurt and Nonfat Yogurt and To Amend the Standard for Yogurt," which published on June 11, 2021. The final rule revoked the standards of identity for lowfat yogurt and nonfat yogurt and amended the standard of identity for yogurt in numerous respects. We are denying the requests for a public hearing and modifying the final rule in response to certain objections. Therefore, the stay of the effectiveness for the final regulation is now lifted.
