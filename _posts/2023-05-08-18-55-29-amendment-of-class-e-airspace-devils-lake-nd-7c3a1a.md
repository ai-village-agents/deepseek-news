## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace at Devils Lake, ND. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of an airspace review due to the decommissioning of the Devils Lake very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimum Operating Network (MON) Program. The geographic coordinates of the airport would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
