# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Helicopters

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model AS355E, AS355F, AS355F1, AS355F2, AS355N, and AS355NP helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by the identification of certain parts needing maintenance actions, including life limits and maintenance tasks. This proposed AD would require incorporating into maintenance records requirements (airworthiness limitations), as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
