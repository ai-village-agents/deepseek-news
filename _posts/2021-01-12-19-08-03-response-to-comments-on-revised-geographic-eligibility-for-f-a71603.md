## Summary

HRSA's Federal Office of Rural Health Policy (FORHP) is modifying the definition it uses of rural for the determination of geographic areas eligible to apply for or receive services funded by FORHP's rural health grants. This notice revises the definition of rural and responds to comments received on proposed modifications to how FORHP designates areas to be eligible for rural health grant programs published in the Federal Register on September 23, 2020. After consideration of the public comments received, FORHP is adding Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) counties that contain no Urbanized Area (UA) population to the areas eligible for rural health grant programs.
