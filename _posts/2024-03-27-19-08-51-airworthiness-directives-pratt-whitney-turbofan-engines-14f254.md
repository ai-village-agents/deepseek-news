## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Pratt & Whitney (PW) Model PW1519G, PW1521G, PW1521GA, PW1521G- 3, PW1524G, PW1524G-3, PW1525G, PW1525G-3, PW1919G, PW1921G, PW1922G, PW1923G, and PW1923G-A engines. This AD was prompted by an updated analysis of an event involving an International Aero Engines, LLC (IAE LLC) Model PW1127GA-JM engine, which experienced a high-pressure compressor (HPC) 7th-stage integrally bladed rotor (IBR-7) separation that resulted in an engine shutdown and aborted takeoff. This AD requires performing an angled ultrasonic inspection (AUSI) of certain high-pressure turbine (HPT) 1st-stage hubs, HPT 2nd-stage hubs, and HPC 8th-stage disks for cracks and, depending on the results of the inspections, replacing the HPT 1st-stage hubs, HPT 2nd-stage hubs, or HPC 8th-stage disks. This AD also requires accelerated replacement of certain HPC 7th-stage rotors, HPC 8th-stage disks, HPC rear hubs, HPT 1st-stage hubs, HPT 2nd-stage hubs, HPT 1st-stage air seals, HPT 2nd- stage air seals, HPT 1st-stage blade retaining plates, and HPT 2nd- stage blade retaining plates. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
