## Summary

The Coast Guard will enforce a special local regulation for the Ironman Ho'ala practice swim and Ironman World Championship Triathlon on October 5 and 11, 2025, to provide for the safety of life on navigable waterways during these events. Our regulation for marine events within the USCG Oceania District (formerly known as the Fourteenth Coast Guard District) identifies the regulated area for this event on certain waters of Kailua Bay, Kailua-Kona, Hawaii. During the enforcement periods, the operator of any vessel in the regulated area must comply with directions from the Patrol Commander or any Official Patrol displaying a Coast Guard ensign.
