## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Maine on August 20, 2020. The Maine Department of Environmental Protection (Maine DEP) submission is in support of the State's separate petition requesting that EPA remove the federal reformulated gasoline (RFG) requirements for York, Cumberland, Sagadahoc, Androscoggin, Kennebec, Knox and Lincoln Counties (hereinafter referred to as the "southern Maine counties"). This action proposes to incorporate into the Maine SIP, Maine's statute, which repealed the State's requirement for the sale of RFG in the southern Maine counties effective November 1, 2020. Maine voluntarily opted into the federal RFG program in 2015. In order to remove the federal RFG requirements from the Maine SIP, Maine is required to complete a noninterference demonstration evaluating whether removing the RFG requirements in the southern Maine counties interferes with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act). EPA is proposing to approve this SIP revision and the corresponding noninterference demonstration. EPA has determined that the revision is consistent with the applicable provisions of the CAA. At this time, EPA is not proposing to remove the requirement for the sale of federal RFG in the applicable southern Maine counties as that is the subject of a separate petition to the EPA Administrator submitted on August 20, 2020, requesting opt-out of the federal RFG program in those counties. The Administrator intends to act on that petition in the near future. This action is being taken under the Clean Air Act.
