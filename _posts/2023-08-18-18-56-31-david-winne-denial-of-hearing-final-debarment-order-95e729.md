## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is denying a request for a hearing submitted by David Roy Winne (Winne) and is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) permanently debarring Winne from providing services in any capacity to a person that has an approved or pending drug product application. FDA bases this order on a finding that Winne was convicted of multiple felonies under Federal law for conduct relating to the regulation of a drug product under the FD&C Act. Winne was given notice of the proposed debarment and an opportunity to request a hearing within the timeframe prescribed by regulation. Winne submitted a request for hearing but failed to file with the Agency information and analysis sufficient to create a basis for a hearing.
