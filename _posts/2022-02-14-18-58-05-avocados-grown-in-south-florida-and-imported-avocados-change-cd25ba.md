## Summary

This rule changes the maturity requirements currently prescribed under the Florida avocado marketing order. The marketing order regulates the handling of avocados grown in South Florida and is administered locally by the Avocado Administrative Committee (Committee). This change establishes beginning and end dates for the annual maturity shipping schedule. A corresponding change will be made to the avocado import regulation as required under section 8e of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937.
