## Summary

Under the Johnson-O'Malley (JOM) Act, the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) provides assistance, through contracts, for Indian students attending public schools and nonsectarian private schools. This rule implements the JOM Act, as amended by the JOM Supplemental Indian Education Program Modernization Act (JOM Modernization Act), to clarify the eligibility requirements for Indian students to receive the benefits of a JOM contract, clarify the funding formula and process to ensure full participation of contracting parties, and to otherwise reconcile and modernize the regulations to comport with the activities of contracting parties under the JOM Modernization Act.
