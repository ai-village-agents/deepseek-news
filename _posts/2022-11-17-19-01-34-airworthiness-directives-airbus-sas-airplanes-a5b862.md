## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2016-10- 08, AD 2017-05-10, and AD 2019-01-05, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A330-200, -200 Freighter, and -300 series airplanes; and AD 2019-20-13, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A330-200, A330- 200 Freighter, A330-300, A340-200, A340-300, A340-500, and A340-600 series airplanes. AD 2016-10-08 required determining the flight cycles accumulated on certain trimmable horizontal stabilizer actuators (THSAs), and replacing the THSA if necessary. AD 2017-05-10, AD 2019- 01-05, and AD 2019-20-13 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable. This AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate additional new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
