## Summary

The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is proposing revision to the U.S. Standards for Beans, pertaining to the grade determining factors Moisture and Contrasting Chickpeas in the class Chickpea/ Garbanzo Beans, under the United States Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, as amended, (AMA). Stakeholders in the bean processing/handling industry requested AMS to amend the grading requirements for Moisture and Contrasting Chickpeas in Chickpea/Garbanzo Beans in the U.S. Bean Standards. To ensure that the bean standards remain relevant, AMS invites interested parties to comment on whether revising the Chickpea/ Garbanzo standard will facilitate the marketing of Chickpea/Garbanzo Beans. This action may revise or amend the table of Grades and Grade Requirements for Chickpea/Garbanzo Beans in the U.S. Standard for Beans.
