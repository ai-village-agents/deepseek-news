## Summary

The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) will host two public online forums to enable public discussion of the Institute's proposals to reorganize its Division of Translational Research, Division of Clinical Research, and functions within its Division of Extramural Activities. The proposals seek to more accurately represent the activities performed within the Institute's Extramural Research Programs, clarify roles and responsibilities, and improve the coordination of the scientific activities within the Institute. The online forums will allow members of the public to review the reorganization proposals and submit comments.
