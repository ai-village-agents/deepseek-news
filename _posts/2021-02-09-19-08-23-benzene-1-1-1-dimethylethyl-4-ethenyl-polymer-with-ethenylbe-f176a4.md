## Summary

EPA has received public health exemption requests from the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food (UDAF) and the Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) to use the pesticide benzene, 1-(1,1- dimethylethyl)-4-ethenyl-, polymer with ethenylbenzene and 2-methyl- 1,3-butadiene, sulfonated (referred to as BIAXAM Polymer) (CAS No. 1637665-77-0) to treat nonporous, non-food-contact surfaces associated with the interior of aircraft and airports to control the new novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The applicants propose the use of a new chemical which has not been registered as a pesticide by EPA. EPA is soliciting public comment before making the decision whether or not to grant the exemptions.
