## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the Pinal County Air Quality Control District (PCAQCD or District) portion of the Arizona State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern the District's negative declarations for the 2008 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS or "standards") in the portion of the Phoenix-Mesa ozone nonattainment area under the jurisdiction of the PCAQCD and two volatile organic compound (VOC) rules covering gasoline dispensing and surface coating operations. We are proposing to approve local rules to regulate these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act). We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
