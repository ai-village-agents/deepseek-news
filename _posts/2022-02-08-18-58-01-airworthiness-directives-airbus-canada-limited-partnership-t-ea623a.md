## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500- 1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of wear damage found between the bonding clamps and the fuel feed tubes inside the left- and right-hand fuel tanks. This AD requires repetitive inspections of the fuel feed tubes for damage, replacement if necessary, and modification of the fuel feed line installation inside the left- and right-hand fuel tanks, which would terminate the repetitive inspections, as specified in a Transport Canada Civil Aviation (TCCA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
