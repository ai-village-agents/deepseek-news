## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is amending its test procedure for dehumidifiers to reference the current version of an applicable industry standard; change the rating test period to be two hours; permit the use of sampling trees in conjunction with an aspirating psychrometer or relative humidity sensor; and provide additional specification for testing dehumidifiers with network capabilities. This rulemaking fulfills DOE's obligation to review its test procedures for covered products at least once every seven years.
