# Frozen Cherry Pie; Revocation of a Standard of Identity and a Standard of Quality

## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is revoking the standard of identity and the standard of quality for frozen cherry pie. This action, in part, responds to a citizen petition submitted by the American Bakers Association (ABA). We conclude that these standards are no longer necessary to promote honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers. Revocation of the standards of identity and quality for frozen cherry pie will provide greater flexibility in the product's manufacture, consistent with comparable, nonstandardized foods available in the marketplace.
