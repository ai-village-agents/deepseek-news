The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is publishing a final rule to amend its test procedure for computer room air conditioners ("CRACs"). DOE is incorporating by reference the latest version of the relevant industry consensus test standard, AHRI 1360-2022. DOE is also adopting the net sensible coefficient of performance ("NSenCOP") metric in its test procedures for CRACs. Additionally, DOE is amending certain provisions for representations and enforcement.
