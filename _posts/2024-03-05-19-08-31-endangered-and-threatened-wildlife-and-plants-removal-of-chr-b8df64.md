## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are removing the Florida golden aster (Chrysopsis floridana), a short-lived perennial, from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Plants (List) due to recovery. Our review indicates that the threats to the species have been eliminated or reduced to the point that the species has recovered and no longer meets the definition of an endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Accordingly, the prohibitions and conservation measures provided by the Act will no longer apply to this species.
