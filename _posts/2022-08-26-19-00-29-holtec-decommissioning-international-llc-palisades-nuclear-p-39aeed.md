## Summary

On December 23, 2020, Holtec Decommissioning International, LLC (HDI) submitted to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) a letter enclosing the post-shutdown decommissioning activities report (PSDAR) for the Palisades Nuclear Plant (Palisades), contingent upon the transfer of the Palisades license to HDI. The PSDAR, which includes the site-specific decommissioning cost estimate (DCE), provides an overview of HDI's planned activities, schedule, projected costs, and environmental impacts for the decommissioning of the Palisades. The Palisades license transfer transaction closed on June 28, 2022. Accordingly, the NRC is noticing receipt of the PSDAR and making it available for public comment. The NRC will hold a public meeting in the vicinity of the Palisades site to discuss the PSDAR's content and receive comments.
