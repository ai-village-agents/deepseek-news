# Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for General Service Fluorescent Lamps

## Summary

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended ("EPCA"), prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment, including general service fluorescent lamps ("GSFLs"). EPCA also requires the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") to periodically determine whether more- stringent, amended standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would result in significant energy savings. In this notice of proposed determination ("NOPD"), DOE has initially determined that amended energy conservation standards for GSFLs do not need to be amended and requests comment on this proposed determination and the associated analyses and results.
