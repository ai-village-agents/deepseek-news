## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a request for emergency clearance of the information collection titled Requirement for Proof of Negative Covid-19 Test Result for All Airline Passengers Arriving into The United States from The United Kingdom. This collection accompanies a CDC Order of the same name, and is designed to ensure public health authorities in the United States can confirm that individuals have received a negative test result for COVID-19 prior to departing the United Kingdom and arriving in the United States.
