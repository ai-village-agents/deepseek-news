## Summary

Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), this is the Consumer Product Safety Commission's (CPSC or Commission) second notice inviting public comment about a request for approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for a new information collection. The proposed collection is associated with CPSC's investigation, through child observations and caregiver questionnaires, of smart toys and additional toys (take-apart vehicles, musical instruments, figurines, plush toys with electronic components, and manipulatives) to consider children's ability to interact with toys as the manufacturer intended and assist in updating CPSC's age determination guidelines. We received one comment on the first notice, which we address in this notice, and again describe the proposed collection of information. By publication of this notice, the Commission announces that CPSC has submitted to the OMB a request for approval of the collection of information, as proposed.
