## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision which Illinois submitted to EPA on December 31, 2018, for attaining the 1-hour sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) primary national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for the Alton Township nonattainment area in Madison County. This plan (herein called a "nonattainment plan") includes Illinois' attainment demonstration and other elements required under the Clean Air Act (CAA), including the requirement for meeting reasonable further progress (RFP) toward attainment of the NAAQS, reasonably available control measures and reasonably available control technology (RACM/ RACT), base-year and projection-year emission inventories, enforceable emission limitations and control measures, nonattainment new source review (NNSR), and contingency measures. EPA is approving Illinois' submission as a SIP revision for attaining the 2010 1-hour primary SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS in the Alton township nonattainment area, finding that Illinois has adequately demonstrated that the plan provisions provide for attainment of the NAAQS in the nonattainment area and that the plan meets the other applicable requirements under the CAA. EPA proposed to approve this action on December 30, 2022, and received no comments.
