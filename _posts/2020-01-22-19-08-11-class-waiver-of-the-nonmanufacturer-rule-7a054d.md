## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is considering granting a request for a class waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule (NMR) for handheld land mobile radios under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334220 and Product Service Code (PSC) 5820. This U.S. industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing handheld land mobile radios. According to the request, no small business manufacturers supply this product to the Federal government. If granted, the class waiver would allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply handheld land mobile radios, regardless of the business size of the manufacturer, on a Federal contract set aside for small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), women-owned small business (WOSB), economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB), historically underutilized business zones (HUBZone), or participants in the SBA's 8(a) Business Development (BD) program.
