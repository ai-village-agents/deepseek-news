## Summary

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service, FWS, or we) is revising its seizure and forfeiture regulations. These regulations establish procedures relating to property seized or subject to administrative forfeiture under various laws enforced by the Service. This revision sets forth the procedures the Service uses for the seizure, bonded release, appraisement, administrative proceeding, petition for remission, and disposal of items subject to forfeiture under laws administered by the Service and reflects the procedures required by the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 (CAFRA) and those of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. This rule makes these regulations easier to understand using simpler language. This revision more clearly explains the procedures used in administrative forfeiture proceedings, makes the process more efficient, and makes the Service's seizure and forfeiture procedures more uniform with those of other agencies subject to CAFRA.
