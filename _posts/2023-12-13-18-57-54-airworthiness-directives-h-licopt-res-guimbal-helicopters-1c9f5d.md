## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all H[eacute]licopt[egrave]res Guimbal Model Cabri G2 helicopters. This AD was prompted by reports of a crack in the pilot cyclic stick base. This AD requires repetitively inspecting certain part-numbered pilot and co- pilot cyclic stick bases and, depending on the results, corrective action. This AD also prohibits installing those pilot and co-pilot cyclic stick bases unless certain requirements are met. These actions are specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA previously sent this AD as an emergency AD to all known U.S. owners and operators of these helicopters. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
