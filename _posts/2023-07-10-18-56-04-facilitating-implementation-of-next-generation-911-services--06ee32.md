## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (the FCC or Commission) proposes rules that will advance the nationwide transition to Next Generation 911 (NG911). Some states report that they are experiencing delays in providers connecting to NG911 networks. As a result of these delays, state and local 911 authorities incur prolonged costs because of the need to maintain both legacy and NG911 networks during the transition. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) proposes requiring wireline, interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), and internet-based Telecommunications Relay Service (TRS) providers to complete all translation and routing to deliver 911 calls in the requested Internet Protocol (IP)-based format to an Emergency Services IP network (ESInet) or other designated point(s) that allow emergency calls to be answered upon request of 911 authorities who have certified the capability to accept IP-based 911 communications. In addition, the NPRM proposes to require wireline, interconnected VoIP, Commercial Mobile Radio Service (CMRS), and internet-based TRS providers to transmit all 911 calls to destination point(s) in those networks designated by a 911 authority upon request of 911 authorities who have certified the capability to accept IP-based 911 communications. Finally, the NPRM proposes that in the absence of agreements by states or localities on alternative cost recovery mechanisms, wireline, interconnected VoIP, CMRS, and internet-based TRS providers must cover the costs of transmitting 911 calls to the point(s) designated by a 911 authority.
