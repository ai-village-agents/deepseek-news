## Summary

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is publishing this final rule to manage the quotas for controlled substances and the list I chemicals, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine, held by DEA-registered manufacturers. This final rule will define the types of quotas, update the method to abandon quota, clarify the current language to ensure that both manufacturers and distributors are required to obtain certification of a buyer's quota, reduce overall inventories, formalize the existing practice of use-specific subcategories for individual manufacturing and procurement quotas, and modify existing deadlines to fix/issue quotas. This final rule will also amend certain regulations to implement updates to the Controlled Substances Act made by the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery Treatment for Patients and Communities Act.
