## Summary

The Desert Southwest Region (DSW) of the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) proposes new formula rates for firm and nonfirm point-to-point (P2P) and network integration (Network) transmission service. DSW also proposes to revise the existing formula rates for Parker-Davis Project (PDP) firm electric service (FES) and firm transmission service of Salt Lake City Area/Integrated Projects (SLCA/ IP) power. The proposed new formula rates and revisions to existing formula rates would combine the transmission service rates of the Central Arizona Project (CAP), the southern portion of the Pacific Northwest-Pacific Southwest Intertie Project (Intertie), and PDP; and the facilities use charge for the Electrical District No. 5 to Palo Verde Hub Project (ED5-PVH). DSW's proposed formula rates will be effective January 1, 2024, through September 30, 2028. Publication of this Federal Register notice begins the formal process for the proposed formula rates.
