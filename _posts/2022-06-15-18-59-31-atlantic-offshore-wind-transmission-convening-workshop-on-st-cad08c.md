## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI)-Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) will hold a virtual Convening Workshop to discuss and receive feedback regarding the benefits, opportunities, and strategies for transmission development for offshore wind (OSW) projects along the Atlantic Coast of the mainland United States (from Maine to South Carolina). This Stakeholder Partnership workshop will focus on strategies to support sustainable and just development of OSW transmission that avoids and minimizes impacts to ocean co-users and marine environments; creates benefits for coastal and underserved communities; and minimizes or mitigates unavoidable negative impacts. This event is part of a series of convening workshops to seek individual advice and obtain information, in order for DOE and BOEM to develop a set of recommendations and an associated action plan for addressing near-, medium-, and long-term OSW transmission challenges. In addition, DOE encourages written comments on these subjects.
