The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") published a direct final rule to establish new energy conservation standards for air cleaners in the Federal Register on April 11, 2023. DOE has determined that the comments received in response to the direct final rule do not provide a reasonable basis for withdrawing the direct final rule. Therefore, DOE provides this document confirming adoption of the energy conservation standards established in the direct final rule and announcing the effective date of those standards.
