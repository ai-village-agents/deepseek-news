## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 747-8 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of stress corrosion cracking in certain stringers and end stringer splice assemblies. This proposed AD would require repetitive inspections of the stringers and end stringer splice assemblies for any crack, shim, or gap, and applicable on- condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
