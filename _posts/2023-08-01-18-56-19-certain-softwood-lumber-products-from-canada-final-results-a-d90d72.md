## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) determines that producers and exporters of certain softwood lumber products (softwood lumber) from Canada received countervailable subsidies during the period of review (POR), January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2021. With respect to one company, we are rescinding this administrative review because the company did not have a reviewable entry during the POR.
