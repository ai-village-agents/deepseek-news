# Privacy Act of 1974; System of Records

## Summary

We propose to revise a system of records in our existing inventory of systems subject to the Privacy Act of 1974. The system is NARA 44, Reasonable Accommodation Request Records. We are revising it to make it more clear that the system includes records of requests for religious accommodations under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Our existing SORN permits religious accommodation requests; however, we want to modify our SORN to expressly authorize such requests for people who may submit religious accommodation requests related to COVID vaccination requirements. We are also updating the SORN to reorganize the SORN into the current required format. In this notice, we publish the system of records notice in full for public notice and comment.
