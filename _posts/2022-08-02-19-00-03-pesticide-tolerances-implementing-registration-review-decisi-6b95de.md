## Summary

EPA is proposing to implement several tolerance actions under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) that the Agency determined were necessary or appropriate during the registration review conducted under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) for the pesticide active ingredients identified in this document. During registration review, EPA reviews all aspects of a pesticide case, including existing tolerances, to ensure that the pesticide continues to meet the standard for registration under FIFRA. The pesticide actions addressed in this rulemaking are identified in Unit I.B. and discussed in detail in Unit III. of this document.
