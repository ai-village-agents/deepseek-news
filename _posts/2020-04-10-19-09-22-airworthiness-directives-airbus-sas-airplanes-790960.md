## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-03-11, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and - 1041 airplanes. AD 2019-03-11 requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive maintenance requirements and airworthiness limitations. Since AD 2019-03-11 was issued, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which will be incorporated by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
