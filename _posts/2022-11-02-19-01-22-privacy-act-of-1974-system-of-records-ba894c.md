## Summary

Pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) proposes to modify a current FDIC system of records titled FDIC-013, Insured Financial Institution Liquidation Records, by updating the name to FDIC-013, Financial Institution Resolution and Receivership Records to more closely reflect the records processed by this system of records; adding a new routine use to allow members of the public to locate and understand the status of their accounts; and revising the policies and practices for retention and disposal of records to describe the records retention schedules for the records included in this system of records. Additionally, this notice includes non-substantive changes to simplify the formatting and text of the previously published notice. We hereby publish this notice for comment on the proposed action.
