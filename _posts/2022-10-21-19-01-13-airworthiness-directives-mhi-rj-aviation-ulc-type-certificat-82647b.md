# Airworthiness Directives; MHI RJ Aviation ULC (Type Certificate Previously Held by Bombardier, Inc.) Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA is revising a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that would have applied to all MHI RJ Aviation ULC Model CL-600-2B19 (Regional Jet Series 100 & 440) airplanes. This action revises the NPRM by proposing to require an inspection for correct installation of the flexible lamp assembly; trimming and reidentifying a bracket; and for certain airplanes, an inspection for damage of the wire harness assembly; and applicable corrective actions. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive (AD) to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over those in the NPRM, the FAA is requesting comments on this SNPRM.
