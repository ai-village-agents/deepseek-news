## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is requesting that any consumer organizations interested in participating in the selection of voting and/or nonvoting consumer representatives to serve on its advisory committees or panels notify FDA in writing. FDA is also requesting nominations for voting and/or nonvoting consumer representatives to serve on advisory committees and/or panels for which vacancies currently exist or are expected to occur in the near future. Nominees recommended to serve as a voting or nonvoting consumer representative may be self-nominated or may be nominated by a consumer organization. FDA seeks to include the views of individuals on its advisory committee regardless of their gender identification, religious affiliation, racial and ethnic identification, or disability status and, therefore, encourages nominations of appropriately qualified candidates from all groups.
