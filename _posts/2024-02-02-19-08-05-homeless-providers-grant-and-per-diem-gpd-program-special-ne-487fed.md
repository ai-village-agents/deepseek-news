## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announces the opportunity of funds in the amount of approximately $5 million per year for up to 2 years under the Grant and Per Diem (GPD) special need grant program. The special need grants enable the GPD program within VA's Homeless Programs Office to offer financial assistance through a 2-year renewal grant to the 16 currently operational GPD special need grantees to defray the cost of facilitating transitional housing and supportive services for eligible Veterans. Funding offered under this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) responds to the need to reach Veterans who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless and who are in one of the special need populations (i.e., chronically mentally ill, frail elderly, individuals who care for minor dependents, terminally ill, or women). This renewal funding will provide assistance to offset operational costs including costs that would not otherwise be incurred, but for the fact that the recipient is providing supportive housing beds in private rooms with private bathrooms for a homeless Veteran population with special needs. This Notice contains information concerning the GPD program, the application process, and amount of funding available. Awards made for program services grants will fund operations beginning on or around October 1, 2024.
