## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all MHI RJ Aviation ULC Model CL-600-2B19 (Regional Jet Series 100 & 440) airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of an oxygen-fed ground fire event potentially caused by electrical arcing from a faulty surround light wire on the third crew member's (observer) oxygen mask. This AD was also prompted by the determination that additional inspections and a bracket trim are needed to address the unsafe condition. This AD requires an inspection for discrepancies of the observer's oxygen mask stowage box and stowage compartment, oxygen hose connections and routing, and the associated electrical harness, and corrective actions if necessary; and modifying the oxygen mask flexible lamp harness, mounting plate, and compartment panel, including rerouting the electrical harness and applying protective sealant. This AD also requires an inspection for correct installation of the flexible lamp assembly; trimming and reidentifying a bracket; and for certain airplanes, an inspection for damage of the wire harness assembly; and applicable corrective actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
