## Summary

On December 20, 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) issued its final determination under section 129 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA), regarding the countervailing duty (CVD) investigation of ripe olives from Spain. On January 12, 2023, the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) directed Commerce to implement the section 129 final determination, which renders Commerce's determinations in the CVD investigation not inconsistent with the World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement findings in United States-- Antidumping and Countervailing Duties on Ripe Olives from Spain, WT/ DS577 (December 20, 2021) (DS577). As a result, Commerce is now implementing the section 129 final determination.
