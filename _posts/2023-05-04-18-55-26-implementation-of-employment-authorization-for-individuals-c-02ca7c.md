## Summary

On January 26, 2023, President Joseph Biden issued a memorandum to the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) determining that it was in the foreign policy interest of the United States to extend and expand the deferral of removal of certain Hong Kong residents present in the United States through February 5, 2025, and to provide them with employment authorization documentation. The memorandum directed the Secretary to make provision for immediate allowance of employment authorization for such individuals. This Notice provides information about Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) for eligible Hong Kong residents and provides information on how eligible individuals may apply for DED-based Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) with USCIS. Through this notice, DHS is providing employment authorization, including procedures for obtaining related documentation, for covered individuals through February 5, 2025, and automatically extending the validity of DED-based EADs bearing a Category Code of A11 and a "Card Expires" date of February 5, 2023 through February 5, 2025. Finally, this Notice provides instructions for DED-eligible Hong Kong residents on how to file for advance travel authorization. For the purposes of this Notice, a Hong Kong resident is defined as an individual of any nationality, or without nationality, who has met the requirements for, and been granted, a Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Passport, a British National Overseas Passport, a British Overseas Citizen Passport, a Hong Kong Permanent Identity card, or a Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Document of Identity for Visa Purposes.
