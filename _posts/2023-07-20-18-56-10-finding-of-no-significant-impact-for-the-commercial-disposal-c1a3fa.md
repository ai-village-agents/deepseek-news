## Summary

The Department of Energy (DOE) has completed the Final Environmental Assessment for the Commercial Disposal of Savannah River Site Contaminated Process Equipment (Final EA). Consistent with the Final EA, the Proposed Action is the disposal of contaminated process equipment from the Savannah River Site (SRS) at a commercial low-level radioactive waste (LLW) disposal facility located outside of South Carolina and licensed by a U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Agreement State. Based on the information and analysis in the Final EA, DOE intends to implement the Proposed Action and send the contaminated process equipment to the Waste Control Specialists LLC (WCS) Federal Waste Facility (FWF), a licensed commercial disposal facility located in Andrews County, Texas, for disposal.
