## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), in accordance with the Endangered Species Act (ESA), provide a list to the public of permits issued under the ESA. With some exceptions, the ESA prohibits take of listed species unless a Federal permit is issued that authorizes or exempts the taking under the ESA. We provide this list to the public as a summary of our permit issuances for candidate conservation agreements with assurances, safe harbor agreements, conservation benefit agreements, habitat conservation plans, and recovery activities for calendar year 2024.
