## Summary

As a result of determinations by the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) that the termination of the Agreement Suspending the Antidumping Duty Investigation on Sugar from Mexico, as amended (AD Agreement), and the suspended antidumping duty (AD) investigation would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping, and by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that termination of the suspended investigation would be likely lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is publishing this notice of continuation of the AD Agreement.
