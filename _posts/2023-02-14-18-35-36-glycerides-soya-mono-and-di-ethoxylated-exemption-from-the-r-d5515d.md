## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of glycerides, soya mono- and di-, ethoxylated (CAS Reg. No. 68553-06-0) when used as an inert ingredient in a pesticide chemical formulation. Spring Regulatory Sciences on behalf of Nouryon Chemicals LLC (USA), submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of glycerides, soya mono- and di-, ethoxylated on food or feed commodities when used in accordance with the terms of those exemptions.
