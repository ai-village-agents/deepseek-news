## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Rockwell Collins, Inc. (Rockwell Collins), GPS-4000S Global Positioning Systems (GPS) installed on airplanes. This AD was prompted by an un-annunciated GPS position error, which could cause a misleading localizer performance with vertical guidance (LPV) glidepath, resulting in controlled flight into terrain (CFIT). This AD requires upgrading the GPS-4000S. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
