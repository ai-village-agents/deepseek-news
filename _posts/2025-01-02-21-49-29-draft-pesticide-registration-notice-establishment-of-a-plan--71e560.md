## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is announcing the availability of and seeking public comment on a draft Pesticide Registration Notice (PR Notice) entitled "Establishment of a Plan to Track the Adoption of Bilingual Labeling on End Use Pesticide Product Labels." PR Notices are issued by the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) to inform pesticide registrants and other interested persons about important policies, procedures, and registration related decisions, and serve to provide guidance to pesticide registrants and OPP personnel. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2022 (PRIA 5) requires EPA to "develop and implement, and make publicly available, a plan for tracking the adoption of the bilingual labeling." This draft PR Notice provides guidance on how the Agency plans to track the adoption of bilingual labeling.
