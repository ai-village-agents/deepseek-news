## Summary

On March 12, 1997, the Federal Trade Commission initiated a review of the effectiveness of its Pay-Per-Call Rule. The Commission sought comment on whether to expand the scope of this rule to cover audio information and entertainment services accessed by dialing telephone numbers that begin with numbers other than "900." After receiving a small number of comments in favor of this approach, the Commission published a notice of proposed rulemaking to revise this rule on October 30, 1998. While comments received during this review were supportive, technological changes have muted the impact of the proposed revisions and the Commission is withdrawing this proposed rulemaking.
