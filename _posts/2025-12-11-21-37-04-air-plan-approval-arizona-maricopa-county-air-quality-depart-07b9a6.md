## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve revisions to the Maricopa County Air Quality Department (MCAQD) portion of the Arizona State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) from solvent cleaning activities and architectural coatings and emissions of particulate matter (PM) from incinerators, burn-off ovens, and crematories. We are approving local rules that regulate these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act").
