## Summary

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO or Office) is publishing this updated guidance to provide a review of the flexible approach to determining obviousness that is required by KSR Int'l Co. v. Teleflex Inc. (KSR). The focus of this document is on post-KSR precedential cases of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit), to provide further clarification for decision-makers on how the Supreme Court's directives should be applied. While highlighting the requirement for a flexible approach to the obviousness determination, this updated guidance also emphasizes the need for a reasoned explanation when reaching a conclusion that a claimed invention would have been obvious. This updated guidance, together with the direction provided in the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP), serves as operable guidance for USPTO personnel when applying the law of obviousness.
