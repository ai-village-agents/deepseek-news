## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) debarring Michael P. Casey for a period of 5 years from importing articles of food or offering such articles for importation into the United States. FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Casey was convicted, as defined in the FD&C Act, of a felony count under Federal law for conduct relating to the importation into the United States of an article of food. Mr. Casey was given notice of the proposed permanent debarment and an opportunity to request a hearing within the timeframe prescribed by regulation. As of November 4, 2019 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Mr. Casey has not responded. Mr. Casey's failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this matter.
