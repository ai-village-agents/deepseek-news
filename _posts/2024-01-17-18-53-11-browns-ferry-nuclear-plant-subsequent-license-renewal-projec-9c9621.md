## Summary

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has decided to adopt the Preferred Alternative identified in the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant (BFN) Subsequent License Renewal (SLR) project Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (Final SEIS). The Notice of Availability of the Final SEIS for the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant Subsequent License Renewal project was published in the Federal Register on August 11, 2023. The Preferred Alternative, Alternative B--BFN Units 1, 2, and 3 Subsequent License Renewal, supports TVA's goal to continue to generate baseload power at the BFN site between 2033 and 2056, thus generating sufficient electricity to supply the Tennessee Valley with increasingly clean, reliable, and affordable electricity for the region's homes and businesses as outlined in TVA's 2019 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP).
