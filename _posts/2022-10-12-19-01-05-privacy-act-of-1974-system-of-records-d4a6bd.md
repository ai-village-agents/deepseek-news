## Summary

The Distributive Shares and Refund Subsystem (DSRS) serves as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) repository for verifying mortgage insurance premium refunds and distributive share payments which are issued to eligible homeowners (mortgagors) who had an FHA mortgage insured loan. Pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is issuing a public notice of its intent to modify a system of records entitled "Distributive Shares and Refund Subsystem" (DSRS). This system of records is being revised to make clarifying changes within: System Location, System Manager, Record Authority for Maintenance of the System, Purpose of the System, Categories of Individuals Covered by the System, Categories of Records in the System, Records Source Categories, Routine Uses of Records Maintained in the System, Retention and Disposal of Records. The SORN modifications are outlined in the SORN SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section.
