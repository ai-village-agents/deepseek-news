## Summary

The FAA is withdrawing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) that would have applied to Erickson Air-Crane Incorporated (now Erickson Incorporated) (Erickson) Model S-64E and S-64F helicopters. The NPRM was prompted by several reports of cracking in the strap and pocket areas of the tail rotor blade. The NPRM would have required inspecting certain tail rotor blade assemblies (blade assembly) for a crack and replacing any cracked blade assembly. Since issuance of the NPRM, the FAA has determined that the unsafe condition no longer exists. Accordingly, the NPRM is withdrawn.
