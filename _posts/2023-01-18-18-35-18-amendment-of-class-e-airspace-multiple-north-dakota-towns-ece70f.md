## Summary

This action amends the Class E airspace at Carrington, ND; Cooperstown, ND; Harvey, ND; Rolla, ND; and Walhalla, ND. This action is due to airspace reviews conducted as part of the decommissioning of the Devils Lake very high frequency (VHF) omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimal Operational Network (MON) Program. The name of Rolla Municipal Airport/Leonard Krech Field, Rolla, ND, is also being updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
