## Summary

NMFS is holding a meeting to discuss the future management of the U.S. West Coast Pacific bluefin tuna (PBF) fishery, including management objectives and a management framework. Given recent developments related to Coronavirus/COVID-19, we have decided to reschedule this meeting originally planned for April 23, 2020. We are taking this step out of an abundance of caution to consider the safety of our visitors. The new date for this meeting is May 19, 2020.
