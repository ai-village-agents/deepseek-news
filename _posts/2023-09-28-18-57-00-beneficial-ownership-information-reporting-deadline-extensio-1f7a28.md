## Summary

FinCEN is proposing to amend the beneficial ownership information (BOI) reporting rule (Reporting Rule) to extend the filing deadline for certain BOI reports. Under the Reporting Rule, entities created or registered on or after the rule's effective date of January 1, 2024, must file initial BOI reports with FinCEN within 30 days of notice of their creation or registration. This proposed amendment would extend that filing deadline from 30 days to 90 days for entities created or registered on or after January 1, 2024, and before January 1, 2025, to give those entities additional time to understand the new reporting obligation and collect the necessary information to complete the filing. Entities created or registered on or after January 1, 2025, would have 30 days to file their BOI reports with FinCEN, as required under the Reporting Rule.
