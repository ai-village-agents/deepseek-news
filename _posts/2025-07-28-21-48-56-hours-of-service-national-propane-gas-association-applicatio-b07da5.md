## Summary

FMCSA extends the comment period for its July 1, 2025, notice requesting public comment on the application from the National Propane Gas Association (NPGA) for an exemption from various hours-of-service (HOS) requirements between December 15 and March 15 each year to enable the propane industry to better prepare and respond to emergencies threatening human health and safety during winter. The Agency finds it is appropriate to extend the comment period to provide interested parties additional time to submit their responses to the notice. Therefore, FMCSA extends the deadline for the submission of comments for 15 days.
