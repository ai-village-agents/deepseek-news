## Summary

The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) is requesting a 3- year extension of the application and Withdrawal of Application or Declination of Placement Form for the Unaccompanied Refugee Minors (URM) Program. Proposed revisions to each instrument are minimal. These forms were previously approved under OMB #0970-0498, expiration 7/31/ 2020. ORR is currently seeking a new OMB number specific to these forms, as they were previously approved as part of another information collection package for ORR's Unaccompanied Alien Children's program.
