## Summary

NMFS announces that the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council submitted Amendment 22 to the Mackerel, Squid, and Butterfish Fishery Management Plan to the Secretary of Commerce for review and approval. We are requesting comments from the public on this amendment in accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. This amendment would implement updated and reformatted goals and objectives for the fishery management plan, a tiered permit system for vessels currently issued an Illex squid moratorium permit, a fish hold volume baseline, a fish hold volume upgrade restriction for the highest tier Illex squid moratorium permits, and clarify that all Illex squid moratorium permits must submit daily catch reports via the vessel monitoring system. The purpose of this action is to align the fishery goals/objectives with current Council vision and priorities and to revise the number and types of Illex squid moratorium permits to reduce the negative effects from a race to fish in recent years.
