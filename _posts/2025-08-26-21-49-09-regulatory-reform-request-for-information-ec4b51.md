## Summary

On May 20, 2025, the United States Department of the Interior (DOI), Office of the Secretary, published in the Federal Register a document entitled "DOI Regulatory Reform RFI" and invited public comments to assist in identifying existing regulations, guidance, reporting requirements, and other regulatory obligations that can be modified or repealed, consistent with applicable law, to ensure that DOI administrative actions do not undermine the national interest and that DOI achieves a meaningful reduction in regulatory and administrative burdens while continuing to meet statutory obligations, advance American energy independence, and ensure the responsible stewardship of the nation's public lands and resources. In order to provide additional opportunity for the public to further consider the RFI and submit comments, DOI has determined that reopening the comment period to have it open indefinitely is appropriate. Interior will continually review written input to determine whether additional regulations, guidance, or reporting requirements should be targeted for review and considered for suspension, revision, or rescission.
