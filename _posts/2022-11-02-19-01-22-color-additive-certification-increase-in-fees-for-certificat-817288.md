## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is proposing to amend the color additive regulation to increase the fee for certification services. The change in fees will allow FDA to continue to maintain an adequate color certification program as required by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). The fees are intended to recover the full costs of operation of FDA's color certification program.
