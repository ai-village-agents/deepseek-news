## Summary

In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) intends to prepare an environmental assessment (EA) to consider the reasonably foreseeable environmental consequences associated with the issuance of a research lease to the State of Maine. That lease would grant Maine the exclusive right to submit, for BOEM's potential approval, plans for wind energy-related research activities offshore Maine. BOEM is seeking public input regarding important environmental issues and the identification of reasonable alternatives that should be considered in the EA.
