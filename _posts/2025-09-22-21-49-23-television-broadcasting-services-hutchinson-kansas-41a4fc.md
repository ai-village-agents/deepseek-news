## Summary

This document proposes to amend the Table of TV Allotments (table) of the Federal Communications Commission's (Commission) rules by substituting channel *33 for *8 at Hutchinson, Kansas in response to a Petition for Rulemaking filed by Kansas Public Telecommunications Service, Inc. (Kansas Public or Licensee), the licensee of noncommercial educational PBS member television station KPTS(TV) (KPTS or Station) channel *8, Hutchinson, Kansas (Hutchinson). In support of its channel substitution request, the Petitioner asserts that allowing the Station to move from a VHF to a UHF channel would serve the public interest by improving signal reception for viewers. The staff engineering analysis finds that the proposal is in compliance with the Commission's principal community coverage and technical requirements. The proposed channel change is predicted to result in service to more viewers, both through better signal quality and an expanded coverage area.
