## Summary

The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, conducts a pre-clearance consultation program to provide the general public and federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on proposed and/or continuing collections of information in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act. This pre-clearance consultation program helps to ensure that requested data can be provided in the desired format, reporting burden (time and financial resources) is minimized, collection instruments are clearly understood, and the impact of collection requirements on respondents can be properly assessed. The purpose of this Notice is to request a three-year clearance for the National Museum Survey (NMS). The NMS will be a voluntary collection that seeks to measure and understand the scope and scale of the role that the nation's diverse museums play in American society. IMLS will use the data collected through the NMS to provide museum practitioners, the public, and policymakers with essential baseline statistics regarding the museum sector. A copy of the proposed information collection request can be obtained by contacting the individual listed below in the ADDRESSES section of this Notice.
