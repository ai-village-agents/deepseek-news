## Summary

The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service is correcting a final rule that was published in the Federal Register on February 21, 2023. The rule established standards governing the humane handling, care, treatment, and transportation of birds, excluding birds bred for use in research, covered under the Animal Welfare Act. The final rule erroneously omitted a word from one paragraph in the amendatory text and included an inaccurate phrase in another paragraph of the amendatory text. This document corrects these errors and amends the regulations to add the appropriate wording.
