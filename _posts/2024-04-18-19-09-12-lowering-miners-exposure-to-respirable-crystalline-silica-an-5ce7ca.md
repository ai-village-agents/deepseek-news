## Summary

The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is amending its existing standards to better protect miners against occupational exposure to respirable crystalline silica, a significant health hazard, and to improve respiratory protection for miners from exposure to airborne contaminants. MSHA's final rule also includes other requirements to protect miner health, such as exposure sampling, corrective actions to be taken when a miner's exposure exceeds the permissible exposure limit, and medical surveillance for metal and nonmetal mines.
