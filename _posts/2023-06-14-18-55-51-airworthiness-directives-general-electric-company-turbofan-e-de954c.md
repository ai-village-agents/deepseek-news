## Summary

The FAA is withdrawing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain General Electric Company (GE) CF6-80E1A2, CF6-80E1A3, CF6-80E1A4, and CF6-80E1A4/B model turbofan engines. The NPRM was prompted by a manufacturer investigation that revealed that certain compressor discharge pressure seals (CDP seals) and forward outer seals were manufactured from powder metal material suspected to contain iron inclusion. The NPRM proposed to require the replacement of the affected CDP seals and forward outer seals. Since issuance of the NPRM, the FAA has reviewed subsequent information received from the manufacturer and determined that the unsafe condition is not likely to exist or develop in other products of the same type design. Accordingly, the NPRM is withdrawn.
