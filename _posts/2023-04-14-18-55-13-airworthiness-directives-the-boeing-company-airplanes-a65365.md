## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-27- 07, which applied to certain The Boeing Company Model 747-400 and 747-8 series airplanes. AD 2022-27-07 required inspecting for wear of the transfer pump housing inlet check valves and transfer pump motor impeller inlet adapters for the horizontal stabilizer fuel tank and doing corrective actions, if necessary. This AD was prompted by the discovery that certain airplanes were incorrectly included in the applicability of AD 2022-27-07. This AD continues to require inspecting for wear of the transfer pump housing inlet check valves and transfer pump motor impeller inlet adapters for the horizontal stabilizer fuel tank and doing corrective actions, if necessary. This AD also removes certain airplanes from the applicability, redefines the definition of an "activated" horizontal stabilizer fuel tank, and limits the installation of affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
