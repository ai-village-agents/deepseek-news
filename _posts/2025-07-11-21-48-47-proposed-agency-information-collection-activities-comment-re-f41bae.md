## Summary

In accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), the OCC, the Board, and the FDIC (the agencies) may not conduct or sponsor, and the respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. On September 28, 2023, the agencies, under the auspices of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), requested public comment for 60 days on a proposal to revise and extend the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Report) (FFIEC 031, FFIEC 041, and FFIEC 051), which are currently approved collections of information. Included in this notice, the Board, under the auspices of the FFIEC, requested public comment for 60 days on the proposal to revise and extend the Report of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks (FFIEC 002) and the Report of Assets and Liabilities of a Non-U.S. Branch that is Managed or Controlled by a U.S. Branch or Agency of a Foreign (Non-U.S.) Bank (FFIEC 002S), which also are currently approved collections of information. The proposed revisions included changes to the Call Report and FFIEC 002 report forms and instructions that were in response to the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-02, "Financial Instruments--Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures" (ASU 2022-02). The agencies are now finalizing instructional revisions related to the length of time that loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty would be reported in the Call Report and FFIEC 002 forms.
