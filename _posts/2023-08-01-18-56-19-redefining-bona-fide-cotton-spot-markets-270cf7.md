## Summary

This rule amends the regulation that defines two of the seven designated spot markets and changing the names of the affected markets. Specifically, market price data for cotton grown in Oklahoma and Kansas are reassigned from the East Texas/Oklahoma spot market to the West Texas spot market. This action also changes the names of these two markets to describe the markets more accurately.
