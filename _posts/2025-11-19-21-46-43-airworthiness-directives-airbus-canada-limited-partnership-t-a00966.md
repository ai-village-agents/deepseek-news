## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2024-04-06, which applies to certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500-1A11 airplanes. AD 2024-04-06 requires repetitive operational checks of the gravity cross flow shut-off valve and, for certain airplanes, a one-time inspection of the motive flow fuel-feed tubes at the clamp blocks location, and applicable corrective action. Since the FAA issued AD 2024-04-06, the manufacturer developed additional corrective actions. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2024-04-06 and would require replacement of the saddle clamp, inspection of the motive flow fuel-feed tubes, and applicable corrective actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
