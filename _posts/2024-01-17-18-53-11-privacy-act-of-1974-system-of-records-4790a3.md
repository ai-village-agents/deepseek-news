## Summary

Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is proposing changes to one system of records notice (SORN). CPSC is proposing to amend CPSC-25--FOIAXpress System of Records (FOIAXpress). The amendment will, in addition to de minimis changes, expand the routine uses to allow the National Archives and Records Administration, Office of Government Information Services (OGIS), access to records contained in the system to the extent necessary to fulfill its responsibilities, to review administrative agency policies and procedures relating to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and compliance with the FOIA, and to facilitate OGIS's offering of mediation services to resolve disputes between persons making FOIA requests and administrative agencies.
