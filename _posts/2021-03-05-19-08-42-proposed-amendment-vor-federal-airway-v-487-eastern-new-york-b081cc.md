## Summary

This action proposes to amend VOR Federal airway V-487 in the vicinity of Glens Falls, NY, and Burlington, VT. The proposed change would substitute a radial from the Burlington, VT, VOR/DME (BTV), in place of the current Glens Falls, NY, VOR/DME (GFL) radial, for defining a navigation fix along the route. Additionally, this action would remove segments of V-487 between Burlington, VT, and St Jean, Canada. These changes are necessary due to the decommissioning of the Glens Falls, NY, VOR/DME, and the decommissioning of the St Jean, Canada VOR/DME (YJN).
