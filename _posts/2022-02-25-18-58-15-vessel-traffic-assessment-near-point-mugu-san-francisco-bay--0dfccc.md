## Summary

On July 28, 2021, U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Pacific Area Command issued the Pacific Coast-Port Access Route Study (PAC-PARS) in the Federal Register directing USCG District Eleven and USCG District Thirteen to complete a PARS on the Pacific coast. In support of the PAC-PARS, USCG District Eleven has identified four areas to evaluate activities within its area of responsibility. USCG District Eleven requests public comments regarding vessel traffic patterns in the areas near Point Mugu and south of the Channel Islands in the Pacific Missile Range, San Francisco Bay, and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) Humboldt Bay and Morro Bay offshore Wind Energy Areas (WEAs). Information received will be used to make recommendations regarding establishing safety routing measures to improve waterway operations and vessel movement along the California coast.
