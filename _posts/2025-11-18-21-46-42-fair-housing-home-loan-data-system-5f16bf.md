## Summary

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) invites public comment on a notice of proposed rulemaking (proposed rule) to rescind its Fair Housing Home Loan Data System regulation codified at 12 CFR part 27. The OCC has determined that the regulation is obsolete and largely duplicative of and inconsistent with other legal authorities that require national banks to collect and retain certain information on applications for home loans. Moreover, part 27 imposes asymmetrical data collection requirements on national banks compared to their other depository institution counterparts, and the data collected has limited utility. For these reasons, rescinding the regulation would eliminate the regulatory burden attributable to part 27 for national banks without having a material impact on the availability of data necessary for the OCC to conduct its fair housing-related supervisory activities.
