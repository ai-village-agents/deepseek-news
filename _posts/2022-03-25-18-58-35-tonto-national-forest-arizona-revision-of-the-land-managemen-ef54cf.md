## Summary

The Forest Service is revising the Tonto National Forest's Land Management Plan (Forest Plan). The Forest Service has prepared a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for its revised Forest Plan and a draft Record of Decision (ROD). This notice is to inform the public that the Tonto National Forest is initiating a 60-day period where individuals or entities with specific concerns about the Tonto National Forest's revised Forest Plan and the associated FEIS may file objections for Forest Service review prior to the approval of the revised Forest Plan. This is also an opportunity to object to the Regional Forester's list of species of conservation concern for the Tonto National Forest.
