## Summary

In this final rule, the Department of Energy ("DOE") is further harmonizing its test procedures with industry practice by updating a currently incorporated testing standard to reference that standard's latest version, incorporating a new industry testing standard that manufacturers would be permitted to use in addition to those industry standards currently incorporated by reference, and harmonizing certain test conditions with current industry standards to improve the comparability of test results for small electric motors. None of these changes would affect the measured average full-load efficiency of small electric motors or the measured nominal full-load efficiency of electric motors when compared to the current test procedures.
