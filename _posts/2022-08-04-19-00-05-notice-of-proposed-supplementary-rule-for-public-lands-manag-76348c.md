## Summary

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) proposes to establish a supplementary rule for BLM-administered public lands within the jurisdiction of the Missoula Field Office. This proposed supplementary rule would allow the BLM to enforce decisions in the Missoula Resource Management Plan (RMP) that cover the general area and specific rules for the Bear Creek Flats, Blackfoot River Recreation Area, Dupont Acquired Lands, Garnet Ghost Town, Limestone Cliffs, and Sperry Grade Area. This rule is needed to further protect natural and historic resources and provide for public health and safety.
