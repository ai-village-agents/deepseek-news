## Summary

This document republishes with modifications and supersedes a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) notice published in the Federal Register on August 13, 2019, announcing a test to allow certain low-value shipments, including those shipments subject to Partner Government Agency (PGA) data requirements, to be entered by filing a new type of informal entry electronically in the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE). The test is known as the ACE Entry Type 86 Test. This document modifies the ACE Entry Type 86 Test to clarify the waiver of certain regulations and consequences of misconduct by test participants. In addition, this document makes minor technical changes to the original notice.
