## Summary

In light of recent disruptions in economic conditions caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and current strains in U.S. financial markets, the Board is issuing an interim final rule that revises the definition of eligible retained income for purposes of the Board's total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) rule. The revised definition of eligible retained income will make any automatic limitations on capital distributions that could apply under the TLAC rule more gradual and aligns to recent action taken by the Board and the other Federal banking agencies in the capital rule.
