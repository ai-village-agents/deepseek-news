## Summary

The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is announcing that it will allow establishments to use the implied nutrient content claim "healthy" on their labels which: (1) Are not low in total fat, but have a fat profile makeup of predominantly mono and polyunsaturated fats; or (2) contain at least ten percent of the Daily Value (DV) per reference amount customarily consumed (RACC) of potassium or vitamin D. FSIS is making this announcement to maintain consistent requirements for food labels by allowing the same uses of the claim "healthy" for meat and poultry products as are currently allowed for food products under the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) jurisdiction.
