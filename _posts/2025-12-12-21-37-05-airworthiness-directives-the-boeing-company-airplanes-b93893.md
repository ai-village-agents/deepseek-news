## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-09- 04, which applied to certain The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, - 700C, -800, -900, and -900ER series airplanes, and certain Model 737-8 and -9 airplanes. AD 2023-09-04 required inspecting all escape slide assemblies to identify affected parts and replacing affected escape slide assemblies with different assemblies. This AD was prompted by the determination that additional airplanes might be affected by the unsafe condition. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2023-09-04 and requires those actions for additional airplanes, including Model 737- 8200 airplanes. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
