## Summary

FMCSA announces its final decision to renew the exemption granted to U.S. Custom Harvesters, Inc. (USCHI) from the intrastate restriction ("K") on commercial driver's licenses (CDLs) for custom harvester drivers operating in interstate commerce for a five-year period. FMCSA's regulations provide an exception to the minimum age requirements for drivers of commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) controlled and operated by a person engaged in interstate custom harvesting. However, FMCSA's CDL regulations do not include a corresponding exception from the intrastate-only (or "K") restriction for these drivers. This exemption renewal continues relief from the CDL provision for five years.
