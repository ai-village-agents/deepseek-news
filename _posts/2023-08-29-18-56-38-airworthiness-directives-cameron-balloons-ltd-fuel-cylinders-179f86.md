## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-13- 03, which applied to a certain Cameron Balloons Ltd. (Cameron) fuel cylinder installed on hot air balloons. AD 2022-13-03 required removing any installed fuel cylinder part number (P/N) CB2990 (Alugas) from service before further flight. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-13-03, the fuel cylinder part number has been identified as CB2990/A instead of CB2990 (Alugas). This AD requires removing any installed fuel cylinders P/N CB2990/A from service before further flight. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
