## Summary

In accordance with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) Oil Spill Final Programmatic Damage Assessment Restoration Plan and Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement and Record of Decision, and the Consent Decree, the Federal and State natural resource trustee agencies for the Mississippi Trustee Implementation Group (MS TIG) have prepared the "Mississippi Trustee Implementation Group Draft Restoration Plan 4 and Environmental Assessment: Restoration of Wetlands, Coastal, and Nearshore Habitats; Nutrient Reduction (Nonpoint Source), and Provide and Enhance Recreational Opportunities" (Draft RP4 and EA). In the Draft RP4 and EA, MS TIG proposes projects to partially restore wetlands, coastal, and nearshore habitats; reduce nutrient pollution (nonpoint source); and provide and enhance recreational opportunities to compensate for lost recreational use in the Mississippi Restoration Area as a result of the DWH oil spill. The Draft RP4 and EA, a No Action alternative is also evaluated for each of the restoration types. The approximate cost to implement the MS TIG's proposed action (seven preferred alternatives) is $26.4 million. We invite public comments on the Draft RP4 and EA.
