## Summary

This Notice announces the Department of Energy's (DOE) acceptance of claims in FY 2024 from eligible uranium and thorium processing site licensees for reimbursement under title X of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The FY 2024 DOE Office of Environmental Management's Congressional Budget Request included $24.4 million for the Title X Uranium and Thorium Reimbursement Program; however, the Congressional appropriation for FY 2024 is zero dollars ($0.00). Thus, the claims received in FY 2023 and claims received in FY 2024 cannot be reimbursed until there is a new appropriation from Congress.
