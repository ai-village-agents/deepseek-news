## Summary

This proposed rule would: Revise the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital- related costs of acute care hospitals; make changes relating to Medicare graduate medical education (GME) for teaching hospitals; update the payment policies and the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs). In additon it would establish new requirements and revise existing requirements for eligible hospitals and critical access hospitals (CAHs) participating in the Medicare Promoting Interoperability Program; provide estimated and newly established performance standards for the Hospital Value- Based Purchasing (VBP) Program; and propose updated policies for the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (IQR) Program, Hospital VBP Program, Hospital-Acquired Condition (HAC) Reduction Program, PPS-Exempt Cancer Hospital Reporting (PCHQR) Program, and the Long-Term Care Hospital Quality Reporting Program (LTCH QRP). It would also revise the hospital and critical access hospital (CAH) conditions of participation (CoPs) for infection prevention and control and antibiotic stewardship programs; and codify and clarify policies related to the costs incurred for qualified and non-qualified deferred compensation plans. Lastly, this proposed rule would provide updates on the Rural Community Hospital Demonstration Program and the Frontier Community Health Integration Project.
