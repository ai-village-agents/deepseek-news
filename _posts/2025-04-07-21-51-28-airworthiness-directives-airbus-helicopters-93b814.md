## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model SA341G and SA342J helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of disbonding of the stainless steel leading edge protection of certain part-numbered main rotor blades (MRB). This proposed AD would require repetitively tap inspecting the MRB and, depending on the results, repairing or replacing the MRB. This proposed AD would also prohibit installing those MRB unless certain requirements are met. These actions are specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
