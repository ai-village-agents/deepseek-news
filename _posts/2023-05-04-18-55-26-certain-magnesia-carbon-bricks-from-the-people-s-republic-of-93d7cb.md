## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) determines that certain refractory brick samples tested by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) do not reflect the chemical composition of magnesia alumina carbon (MAC) bricks and are covered by the antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on certain magnesia carbon bricks (bricks) from the People's Republic of China (China). Additionally, Commerce finds that it is unable to determine whether certain other samples tested by CBP have the chemical composition of a bricks subject to the AD and CVD orders on bricks from China.
