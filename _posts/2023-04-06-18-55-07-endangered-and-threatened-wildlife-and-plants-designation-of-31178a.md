We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), designate critical habitat for the pearl darter (Percina aurora) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. In total, approximately 524 river miles (843 river kilometers) in Clarke, Covington, Forrest, George, Green, Lauderdale, Jackson, Jones, Newton, Perry, Simpson, Stone, and Wayne Counties, Mississippi, fall within the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The effect of this regulation is to designate critical habitat for the pearl darter under the Act.
