## Summary

This action amends the Class E airspace at Harrison, OH. This action is the result of an airspace review conducted due to the decommissioning of the Cincinnati very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimum Operating Network (MON) Program. The geographic coordinates of the airport are also being updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database. This action brings the airspace into compliance with FAA orders to support instrument flight rule (IFR) operations.
