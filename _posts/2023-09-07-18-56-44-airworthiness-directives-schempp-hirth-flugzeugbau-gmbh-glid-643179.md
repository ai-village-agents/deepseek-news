## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Schempp-Hirth Flugzeugbau GmbH (Schempp-Hirth) Model Ventus-2a and Ventus-2b gliders. This AD is prompted by reports of the uncommanded extraction of the airbrakes on one or both wings, possibly resulting in reduced control of the glider. This AD requires repetitively inspecting airbrake bell cranks and airbrake drive funnels for cracking, repetitively inspecting the clearance of the airbrake control system, and taking corrective action as necessary. This AD also requires modifying the airbrake system, which is terminating action for the repetitive inspections. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
