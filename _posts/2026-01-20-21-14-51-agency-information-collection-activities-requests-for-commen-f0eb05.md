## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The FAA uses the information collected on form 7460-1 to determine the effect a proposed construction or alteration would have on air navigation and the National Airspace System (NAS) and the information collected on form 7460-2 to measure the progress of actual construction.
