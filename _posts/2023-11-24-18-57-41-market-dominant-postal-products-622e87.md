## Summary

The Commission previously proposed amendments to its regulations concerning rate incentives for Market Dominant products. After the period for filing comments in the instant docket closed, in Docket No. R2023-3, the Postal Service proposed, and the Commission subsequently approved, two Market Dominant rate incentives for Calendar Year (CY) 2024. Because the rule proposals in the instant docket may have a bearing on any future proposals to include these rate incentives in the percentage change in rates calculation, the Commission provides the public with an opportunity to comment on the relationship of the rule proposals in the instant docket and the rate incentives approved for CY 2024 in Docket No. R2023-3.
