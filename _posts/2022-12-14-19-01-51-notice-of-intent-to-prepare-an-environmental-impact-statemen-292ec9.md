## Summary

The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) California State Office announces its intent to prepare an EIS for the McGriff Lakes--Sutter Basin Watershed Flood Control and Flood Safety Project, which is located approximately 30 miles northwest of Sacramento in the proximity of Knights Landing, California. NRCS is requesting comments to identify significant issues and alternatives to be addressed in the EIS from all interested individuals, Tribes, and Federal, State and local Agencies and jurisdictions. The EIS process will examine alternative solutions to modernize the existing Karnak Drainage Facility, portions of which are over 100 years old, to continue to provide reliable flood protection for the Reclamation District No. 1500 (RD 1500) service area. The Reclamation District service area includes over 60,000 acres of agricultural farmland, the community of Robbins and surrounding rural areas, and California State Route 113, a designated emergency route through the watershed. The primary purpose for this watershed plan is to provide reliable and long-term flood prevention and damage reduction to the RD 1500 service area and improve public safety and emergency access. Although the existing Karnak Drainage Facility has been well maintained, the required repairs for the pump stations are becoming more costly while the reliability of the facility is decreasing because parts needed for repair and continued operation are no longer available and must be custom fabricated. The aging infrastructure and lack of parts availability puts all land within the RD1500 service area at risk in the event of a significant rainfall event. Without adequate and reliable flood control, millions of dollars in agricultural products would be at risk, the designated emergency route would be in jeopardy of flood closures, and substantial property damage and potential loss of life are possible in the community of Robbins and surrounding areas.
