## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish two temporary safety zones for certain waters of the Patapsco River. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters at the Francis Scott Key Bridge during demolition and construction operations. This rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Maryland-National Capital Region or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
