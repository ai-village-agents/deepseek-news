## Summary

NMFS announces its intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), to analyze the impacts of alternatives related to NMFS's issuance of an incidental take statement (ITS) for species listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) affected by salmon fisheries in Southeast Alaska (SEAK) that are managed consistent with the provisions of the 2019 Pacific Salmon Treaty (PST) Agreement. Compliance with the ITS would exempt participants in these fisheries from the ESA's prohibition on take of threatened and endangered species. This notice is necessary to inform the public of NMFS's intent to prepare this EIS and to provide the public with an opportunity to provide input for NMFS's consideration.
