## Summary

We, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), propose to designate specific areas in the marine environment as critical habitat for six distinct population segments (DPSs) of the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973, as amended. The DPSs that occur in waters under U.S. jurisdiction include the threatened North Atlantic, South Atlantic, East Pacific, and Central North Pacific DPSs and the endangered Central South Pacific and Central West Pacific DPSs. Proposed critical habitat includes nearshore areas from the mean high water line to 20 m depth located along the coasts of Florida, North Carolina, Texas, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, California (which also includes nearshore areas from the mean high water line to 10 km offshore), Hawai`i, American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. It also includes Sargassum habitat, from 10 m depth to the outer boundary of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone, in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean. Based on consideration of economic impacts, we propose to exclude multiple areas from designation. We are soliciting comments on all aspects of the proposed critical habitat designations and will consider information received prior to making final designations. We are also announcing public informational meetings and public hearings.
