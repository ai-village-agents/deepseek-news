# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus SAS Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A330-200, A330-200 Freighter, A330-300, A330-800, and A330-900 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that part of a certain production ground test procedure used to confirm inner fuel tank integrity was not accomplished properly on certain airplanes. This proposed AD would require a fuel tank leak test and, depending on findings, accomplishment of applicable corrective action, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
