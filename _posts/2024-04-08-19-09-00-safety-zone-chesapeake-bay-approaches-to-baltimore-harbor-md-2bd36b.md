## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for navigable waters within a 2000-yard radius of the center span of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, in Baltimore, MD. The safety zone is needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards associated with salvage work on the bridge, which partially collapsed when it was hit by the M/V DALI, and on the M/V DALI itself. Entry of vessels or persons into this zone is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port, Sector Maryland-National Capital Region.
