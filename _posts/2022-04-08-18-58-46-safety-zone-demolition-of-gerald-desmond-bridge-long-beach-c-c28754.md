## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for waters near Gerald Desmond Bridge during demolition. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters near Long Beach, CA, during period where the over-the- water portion of the Gerald Desmond Bridge will be subject to demolition from May 7, through May 9, 2022. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port (COTP), Los Angeles-Long Beach, or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
