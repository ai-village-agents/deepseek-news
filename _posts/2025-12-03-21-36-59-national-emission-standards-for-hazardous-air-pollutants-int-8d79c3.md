## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is taking final action to respond to comments on an interim final rule (IFR) related to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Integrated Iron and Steel Manufacturing Facilities ("II&S NESHAP"). Specifically, the EPA is responding to comments on the IFR published in the Federal Register on July 3, 2025, that revised compliance deadlines for certain provisions related to planned bleeder valve openings, unplanned bleeder valve openings, blast furnace (BF) casthouses, basic oxygen process furnace (BOPF) shops, slag processing and handling, beaching, and fenceline monitoring. After carefully considering the comments, the EPA concludes that the amendments made in the IFR are warranted and is not making any further changes to the compliance deadlines revised in the IFR.
