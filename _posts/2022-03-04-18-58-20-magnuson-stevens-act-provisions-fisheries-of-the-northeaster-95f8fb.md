# Magnuson-Stevens Act Provisions; Fisheries of the Northeastern United States; Northeast Multispecies Fishery; 2022 Allocation of Northeast Multispecies Annual Catch Entitlements

## Summary

We propose to approve allocations of annual catch entitlements to groundfish sectors for the 2022 fishing year and approve changes to previously approved sector operations plans. This rule also proposes to disapprove four novel sector exemption requests. The action is necessary because sectors must receive allocations in order to operate in fishing year 2022. This action is intended to allow limited access permit holders to continue to operate or form sectors, as authorized under the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan, and to exempt sectors from certain effort control regulations to improve the efficiency and economics of sector vessels.
