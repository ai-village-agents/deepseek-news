## Summary

The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Utah State Office, in cooperation with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Cache Water District (project sponsor), announces its intent to prepare an EIS for the Wellsville Canyon Watershed Plan located within the Little Bear River Watershed in Cache County, Utah. The proposed Wellsville Canyon Watershed Plan will examine alternative solutions to provide flood protection and conveyance infrastructure, reduce irrigation water loss, enhance recreational facilities, and reduce erosion and nutrient loading to the Little Bear River in Wellsville and Mendon cities and portions of unincorporated Cache County. NRCS is requesting comments to identify significant issues, potential alternatives, information, and analyses relevant to the proposed action from all interested individuals, Federal and State agencies, and Tribes.
