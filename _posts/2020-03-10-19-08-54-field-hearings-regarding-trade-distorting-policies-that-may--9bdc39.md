## Summary

The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) and the Departments of Commerce and Agriculture will convene public hearings in Florida and Georgia to hear firsthand from interested persons on trade distorting policies that may be causing harm to U.S. seasonal and perishable producers (namely, of fresh fruits and vegetables) and contributing to unfair pricing in the U.S. market, and to solicit feedback on how the Administration can better support these producers and redress any unfair harm.
