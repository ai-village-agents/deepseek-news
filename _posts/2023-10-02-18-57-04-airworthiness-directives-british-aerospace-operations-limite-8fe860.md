## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-19-22 for all British Aerospace Regional Aircraft Jetstream Series 3101 and Jetstream Model 3201 airplanes. AD 2017-19-22 required incorporating BAE Systems' Corrosion Prevention and Control program into the Airworthiness Limitations Section (ALS) of the existing instructions for continued airworthiness (ICA) for your airplane, which added new and more restrictive inspections for corrosion that include inspecting the door hinges/supporting structure and attachment bolts for the main spar joint and engine support, and the rudder hinge location on the vertical stabilizer, and applicable corrective actions. Since the FAA issued AD 2017-19-22, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) of the United Kingdom (UK) superseded the mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) issued by the European Aviation Safety Agency (now European Union Aviation Safety Agency) (EASA) to correct an unsafe condition on these products. This AD requires revising the ALS of the existing ICA for your airplane. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
