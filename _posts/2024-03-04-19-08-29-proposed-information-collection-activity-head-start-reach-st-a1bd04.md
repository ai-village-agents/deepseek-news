## Summary

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is proposing to collect data on different approaches that Head Start programs use to recruit, select, and enroll families, and the ways in which such practices reflect programs' community contexts. We are not attempting to recruit a nationally representative sample. Instead, the study will aim to obtain a variety of eligibility, recruitment, selection, enrollment, and attendance (ERSEA) practices and experiences to explore how these practices and experiences intersect with different adversities, demographic characteristics, and community contexts.
