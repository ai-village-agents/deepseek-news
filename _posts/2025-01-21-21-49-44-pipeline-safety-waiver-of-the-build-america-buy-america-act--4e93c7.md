## Summary

The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) is waiving the Build America, Buy America (BABA) Act's domestic preference requirements for certain products widely used in natural gas distribution systems on the basis of nonavailability. The waiver will apply to awards obligated on or after the effective date of the final waiver for recipients of funding under the Natural Gas Distribution Infrastructure Safety and Modernization (NGDISM) Grant Program and, in the case of awards obligated prior to the effective date, all expenditures for covered products incurred after the effective date. The waiver will expire after three years after the effective date of the final waiver.
