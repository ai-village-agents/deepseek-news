## Summary

In accordance with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), EPA is issuing a notice of receipt of requests by registrants to voluntarily cancel registrations of certain products containing the pesticide chlorpyrifos and to amend their chlorpyrifos registrations to terminate one or more uses. EPA intends to grant these requests at the close of the comment period for this announcement unless the Agency receives substantive comments within the comment period that would merit further review of the requests, or unless the registrants withdraw their requests. If these requests are granted, any sale, distribution, or use of the products listed in this notice after the registrations have been cancelled or the uses terminated would need to be consistent with the terms as described in the final order.
