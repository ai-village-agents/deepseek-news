## Summary

The NCUA Board (Board) is amending various parts of the NCUA's regulations to permit Low-income Designated Credit Unions, Complex Credit Unions, and New Credit Unions to issue Subordinated Debt for purposes of Regulatory Capital treatment. The Board issued the proposed Subordinated Debt rule at its January 2020 meeting. The Board is finalizing the rule largely as proposed, except for a few changes to various sections based on comments received. Such changes include amending the definition of Accredited Investor, providing a longer timeframe in which a credit union may issue Subordinated Debt after approval, reducing the required number of years of Pro Forma Financial Statements an Issuing Credit Union must provide with its application, clarifying the prohibition on Subordinated Debt issuances outside of the United States, and clarifying that the Board will publish a fee schedule only if it makes a determination to charge a fee.
