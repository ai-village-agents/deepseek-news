# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus SAS Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is proposed for incorporation by reference. This proposed AD would also require, for certain airplanes, an update of the hydraulic monitoring system to include additional redundancy. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
