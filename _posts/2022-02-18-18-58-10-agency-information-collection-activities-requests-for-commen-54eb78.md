## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew Information Collection 2120-0776. The purpose of this notice is to allow 60 days for public comment. The FAA proposes collecting information related to requests made to operate Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) in controlled airspace. FAA will use the collected information to make determinations whether to authorize or deny the requested authorization of UAS operation in controlled airspace. The proposed information collection is necessary to issue such authorizations or denials consistent with the FAA's mandate to ensure safe and efficient use of national airspace.
