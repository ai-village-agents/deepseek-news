## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-03- 12, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A330-200, -300, -800, and - 900 series airplanes; and Model A340-200, -300, -500, and -600 series airplanes. AD 2022-03-12 required replacing the doghouse door lock placard with an improved instruction placard. This AD was prompted by reports that the instructions on the doghouse door lock placard are unclear and incomplete, and by a determination that additional parts need to be modified. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2022-03-12 and expands the list of affected parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also prohibits the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
