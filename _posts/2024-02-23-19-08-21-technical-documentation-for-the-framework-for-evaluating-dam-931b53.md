## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing a 30- day public comment period for the draft document titled, "Technical Documentation for the Framework for Evaluating Damages and Impacts (FrEDI)" (EPA 430-R-24-001). This document provides technical documentation of a Framework used to analyze future climate change- related impacts to the United States, projected to occur across multiple impact sector categories, geographic regions, and populations, under any custom temperature scenario. This approach serves as an alternative or complement to traditional scenario-based approaches in order to improve communication of results, comparability between studies, and flexibility to facilitate scenario analysis. The draft technical documentation will also be subject to external peer review. Prior to finalizing the draft document, EPA intends to carefully consider all comments received from the public and from external peer reviewers. This draft document is not final as described in EPA's information quality guidelines and does not represent and should not be construed to represent Agency policy or views. The draft document is available via the internet on EPA's web page at https://www.epa.gov/ cira/2024-draft-fredi-td.
