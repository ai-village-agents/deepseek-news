## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to find that Huntington Township, Indiana (referred to in this proposed rule as the Huntington County, Indiana area) is attaining the 2010 sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) and to propose approval of Indiana's request to redesignate the area to attainment for the 2010 SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS, because the request meets the statutory requirements for redesignation under the Clean Air Act (CAA). EPA is also proposing to approve Indiana's maintenance plan for the area, which, once approved, will become part of Indiana's federally enforceable State Implementation Plan (SIP).
