## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to redesignate the Oakridge, Oregon nonattainment area (Oakridge NAA or Oakridge area) to attainment for the 2006 24-hour fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). EPA also proposes to approve a maintenance plan for the area demonstrating continued compliance with the PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS through 2035, which the Lane Regional Air Protection Agency (LRAPA) developed in coordination with the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ), for inclusion into the Oregon State Implementation Plan (SIP). The Oakridge PM<INF>2.5</INF> maintenance plan was submitted to EPA by ODEQ along with the redesignation request on January 13, 2022. Additionally, EPA proposes to approve the motor vehicle emissions budgets included in the Oakridge PM<INF>2.5</INF> maintenance plan and inform the public that we are starting the adequacy process for the proposed motor vehicle emissions budgets, including a public comment period. EPA also proposes to approve additional control measures because incorporation of these measures will strengthen the Oregon SIP and ensure PM<INF>2.5</INF> emissions reductions in the Oakridge area. Finally, EPA proposes to take final agency action on an exceptional events request submitted by ODEQ on July 22, 2021 and concurred on by EPA on April 1, 2022. EPA proposes these actions pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act).
