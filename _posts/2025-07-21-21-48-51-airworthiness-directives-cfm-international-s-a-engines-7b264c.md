## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-23-12 for all CFM International, S.A. (CFM) Model LEAP-1B21, LEAP-1B23, LEAP- 1B25, LEAP-1B27, LEAP-1B28, LEAP-1B28B1, LEAP-1B28B2, LEAP-1B28B2C, LEAP-1B28B3, LEAP-1B28BBJ1, and LEAP-1B28BBJ2 engines. AD 2023-23-12 required replacing certain high-pressure turbine (HPT) rotor stage 1 disks and a certain compressor rotor stages 6-10 spool. Since the FAA issued AD 2023-23-12, the manufacturer has identified additional parts that were manufactured from material suspected to have reduced material properties due to iron inclusion, which prompted this AD. This AD retains the requirements to replace certain HPT rotor stage 1 disks and a certain compressor rotor stages 6-10 spool. This AD also expands the applicability to include additional affected HPT rotor stage 1 disks that were manufactured from the same material suspected to have reduced material properties due to iron inclusion. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
