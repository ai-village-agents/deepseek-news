## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Insurance Office Act of 2010 (FIO Act), the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) intends to request approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for the collection of information from certain property & casualty (P&C) insurers regarding their current and historical underwriting data on homeowners' insurance, as described below. The proposed data collection will assist FIO's assessment of climate-related exposures and their effects on insurance availability for policyholders, including whether climate change may create the potential for any major disruptions of private insurance coverage in regions of the country particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts. FIO will also seek to assess any related effects on insurance affordability for policyholders. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) requires federal agencies to publish a notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of information before submission to OMB, and to allow 60 days for public comment in response to the notice. This notice complies with that requirement.
