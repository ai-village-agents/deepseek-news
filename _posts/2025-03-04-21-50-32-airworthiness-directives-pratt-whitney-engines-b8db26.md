## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Pratt & Whitney (PW) Model PW1519G, PW1521G, PW1521GA, PW1521G- 3, PW1524G, PW1524G-3, PW1525G, PW1525G-3, PW1919G, PW1921G, PW1922G, PW1923G, and PW1923G-A engines with a certain high-pressure compressor (HPC) 7th-stage axial rotor installed. This AD was prompted by an analysis of an event involving an International Aero Engines, LLC (IAE LLC) Model PW1127GA-JM engine, which experienced an HPC 7th-stage integrally bladed rotor (IBR-7) separation that resulted in an aborted takeoff. This AD requires performing initial and repetitive angled ultrasonic inspections (AUSI) of certain HPC 7th-stage axial rotors for cracks and replacing the HPC 7th-stage axial rotors if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
