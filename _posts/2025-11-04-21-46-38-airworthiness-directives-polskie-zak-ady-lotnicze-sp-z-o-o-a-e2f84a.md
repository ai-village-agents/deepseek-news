## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Polskie Zak[lstrok]ady Lotnicze Sp. z o.o. Model PZL M28 05 airplanes. The FAA previously sent this AD as an emergency AD to all known U.S. owners and operators of these airplanes. This AD was prompted by damage found in Frame No. 29 and rudder control unit mounting components on Frame No. 29. This AD requires a one-time inspection of the rudder control system mounting bracket attachment components to Frame No. 29 for loose or damaged bolts and the components of Frame No. 29 for cracks and damage, and corrective actions if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
