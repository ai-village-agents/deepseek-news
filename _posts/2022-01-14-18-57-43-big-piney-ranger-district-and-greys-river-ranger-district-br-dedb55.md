## Summary

The Bridger-Teton National Forest (BTNF) is preparing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Dell Creek and Forest Park Feedgrounds: Long-Term Special Use Permit project. The Wyoming Game and Fish Commission (WGFC) has applied for continued use of facilities on National Forest System lands to conduct their elk management activities, including providing hay to wintering elk at Dell Creek and Forest Park feedgrounds between mid-November and the end of April. The Dell Creek feedground is in the Big Piney Ranger District on Dell Creek Road (Forest Service Road 30600) about 4 miles east of Highway 191/189, in Bondurant, Wyoming, and has been maintained by the WGFC under a Forest Service special use permit since 1975. The Forest Park feedground is in the Greys River Ranger District along the Greys River Road (Forest Service Road 10138) about 33 miles from Alpine, Wyoming, and has been maintained by the WGFC under a Forest Service special use permit since 1979. The Forest Service action is to determine whether to authorize the requested long-term use and if so, under what conditions.
