## Summary

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) proposes to revise its regulations to provide incentive-based rate treatments for the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce by utilities for the purpose of benefitting consumers by encouraging investments by utilities in advanced cybersecurity technology and participation by utilities in cybersecurity threat information sharing programs, as directed by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 (Infrastructure and Jobs Act). This notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) also terminates the NOPR proceeding in Docket No. RM21-3-000 (December 2020 Cybersecurity Incentives NOPR).
