## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of North Carolina, through the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, Division of Air Quality (DAQ), on July 10, 2019. The SIP revision modifies the State's annual emissions reporting regulation by removing the annual emissions reporting requirement for certain non- Title V facilities in geographic areas that have been redesignated to attainment for the 1979 1-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards ("NAAQS" or "standards") and in the areas listed in the rule that have been redesignated to attainment for the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS, with the exception of the geographic areas that have been redesignated to attainment for the 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS. The SIP revision also makes minor changes that do not significantly alter the meaning of the regulation. EPA is approving this revision pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act).
