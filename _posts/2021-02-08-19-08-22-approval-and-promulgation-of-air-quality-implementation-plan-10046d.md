## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC). This SIP revision consists of the 2010 amendments to the State of Delaware's Mobile Equipment Repair and Refinishing (MERR) regulations to incorporate the Ozone Transport Commission's (OTC) 2009 Motor Vehicle and Mobile Equipment Non-Assembly Line Coating Operations regulations (MVMERR) model rule. The MVMERR rule establishes updated volatile organic compounds (VOC) content limits for coating and cleaning solvents used in vehicle refinishing and standards for coating application, work practices, monitoring, and recordkeeping. This action is being taken under the Clean Air Act (CAA).
