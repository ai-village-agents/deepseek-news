## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC, Commission, or Agency) has modified an existing system of records, FCC/OMD-30, FCC Visitors Database, subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. This action is necessary to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act to publish in the Federal Register notice of the existence and character of records maintained by the agency. The FCC's Security Operations Center (SOC) in the Office of Managing Director (OMD) uses this system to maintain the personally identifiable information (PII) that all visitors to the FCC, including but not limited to U.S. citizens, permanent residents (i.e., green card holders), and foreign nationals, must provide to the SOC to gain admittance to the FCC headquarters buildings and other FCC facilities.
