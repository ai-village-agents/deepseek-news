## Summary

This Notice advises the public that the Indian Health Service (IHS) proposes to expand the geographic boundaries of the Purchased/ Referred Care Delivery Area (PRCDA) for the Spokane Tribe of the Spokane Reservation to include the counties of Spokane and Whitman in the State of Washington. The current PRCDA for the Spokane Tribe of the Spokane Reservation includes the Washington counties of Ferry, Lincoln, and Stevens. Spokane Tribal members residing outside of the PRCDA are eligible for direct care services, however, they are not eligible for Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) services. The sole purpose of this expansion would be to authorize additional Spokane Tribal members and beneficiaries to receive PRC services.
