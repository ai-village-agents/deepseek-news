## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, invite the public to comment on the following applications for a permit to conduct scientific research to promote conservation or other activities intended to recover and enhance endangered species survival. With some exceptions, the Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits certain activities that may impact endangered species, unless a Federal permit allows such activity. The ESA also requires that we invite public comment before issuing these permits.
