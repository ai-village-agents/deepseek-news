## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) adopts a voluntary cybersecurity labeling program for wireless consumer Internet of Things, or IoT, products. The final rule also requires applicant manufacturers to make certain disclosures related to their product(s) for authorization to use the FCC IoT Label. This is a summary of the Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Further Notice), in which the Commission proposes rules on additional national security declarations for the IoT labeling program. These requirements would further help consumers make safer purchasing decisions, raise consumer confidence regarding the cybersecurity of the IoT products they buy, and encourage manufacturers to develop IoT products with security-by-design principles in mind.
