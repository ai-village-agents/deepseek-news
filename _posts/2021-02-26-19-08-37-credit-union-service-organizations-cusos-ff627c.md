## Summary

The NCUA Board (Board) is seeking comment on a proposed rule that would amend the NCUA's credit union service organization (CUSO) regulation. The proposed rule would accomplish two objectives: Expanding the list of permissible activities and services for CUSOs to include originating any type of loan that a Federal credit union (FCU) may originate; and granting the Board additional flexibility to approve permissible activities and services. The NCUA is also seeking comment on broadening FCU investment authority in CUSOs.
