## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A318, A319, A320, and A321 series airplanes; Model A330-200, -200 Freighter, -300, -800, and -900 series airplanes; and Model A340-200, -300, -500, and -600 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of trimmable horizontal stabilizer actuators (THSAs) being delivered to operators having erroneous information (accumulated life) in the authorized release certificate. This AD requires contacting Collins Aerospace for amended authorized release certificates for the affected parts and replacing the affected parts if necessary, and prohibits the installation of affected parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
