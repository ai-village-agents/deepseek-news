## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by an indication that both elevator actuators of the PRIMary flight control computers (PRIMs) were considered faulty due to incorrect instructions with a new PRIM standard. This AD requires revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM), and revising the operator's existing FAA-approved minimum equipment list (MEL) by incorporating certain master minimum equipment list (MMEL) provisions, to include limitations and procedures to mitigate the risk of elevator failure during flare, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Emergency AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
