## Summary

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is adopting this final rule to amend certain regulatory thresholds in the FDIC's regulations to reflect inflation. Specifically, this final rule generally updates such thresholds to reflect inflation from the date of initial implementation or the most recent adjustment and provides for future adjustments pursuant to an indexing methodology. The changes set forth in this final rule preserve the level of certain thresholds set forth in the FDIC's regulations in real terms, thereby avoiding the undesirable and unintended outcome where the scope of applicability for a regulatory requirement changes due solely to inflation rather than actual changes in an institution's size, risk profile, or level of complexity.
