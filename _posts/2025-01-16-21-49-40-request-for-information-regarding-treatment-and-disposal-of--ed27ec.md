## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Environmental Management Consolidated Business Center and Office of Environmental Management are currently in the acquisition planning and regulatory planning stages for a potential future treatment and disposal (T&D) acquisition activity and fee rulemaking activities for elemental mercury waste. This planning supports DOE's efforts to implement the requirements of the Mercury Export Ban Act of 2008, as amended by the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act. DOE's Office of Environmental Management is issuing this RFI for the purpose of conducting market research in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). This RFI is also being issued to potentially support a future rulemaking action that would establish a fee to provide long- term management and storage of elemental mercury. No contract solicitation is available through this RFI.
