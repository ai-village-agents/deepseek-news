## Summary

NMFS has received a request from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) for incidental take regulations (ITR) and a Letter of Authorization (LOA) pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The requested regulations would govern the authorization of take of small numbers of marine mammals over 5 years (2026-2031) incidental to the Duckabush Estuary Restoration Project (DERP) in Hood Canal, Washington. NMFS requests public comments and will consider them prior to making any final decision on the requested ITR and issuance of the LOA; agency responses to comments will be summarized in the final rule, if issued.
