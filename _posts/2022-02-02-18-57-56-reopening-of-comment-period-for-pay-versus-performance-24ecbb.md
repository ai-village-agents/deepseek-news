## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") is reopening the comment period for its proposal to implement Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ("Dodd-Frank Act"). The proposed rule would amend the current executive compensation disclosure rule to require a description of how executive compensation actually paid by a registrant related to the financial performance of that company ("proposed rules"). The proposed rules were first set forth in a release published in the Federal Register on May 7, 2015 (Release No. 34-74835) ("Proposing Release"), and the related comment period ended on July 6, 2015. The reopening of this comment period is intended to allow interested persons further opportunity to analyze and comment upon the proposed pules in light of developments since the publication of the Proposing Release and our further consideration of the Section 953(a) mandate, including by responding to the additional requests for comment included in this release.
