## Summary

On December 16, 2020, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") published a final rule adopting separate product classes for top- loading consumer (residential) clothes washers and consumer clothes dryers that offer cycle times for a normal cycle of less than 30 minutes, and for front-loading residential clothes washers that offer cycle times for a normal cycle of less than 45 minutes ("December 2020 final rule"). This document corrects an omission in the amended regulatory text as it appeared in the December 2020 final rule. Neither the error nor the correction in this document affect the substance of the rulemaking or any conclusions reached in support of the final rule.
