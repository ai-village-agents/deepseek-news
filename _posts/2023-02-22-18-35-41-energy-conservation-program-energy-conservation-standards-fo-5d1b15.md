## Summary

On January 11, 2023, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") published a notice of proposed rulemaking and announcement of public meeting ("NOPR") proposing amended energy conservation standards for distribution transformers, and also to announce a public meeting to receive comment on the proposed standards and associated analyses and results. The notice provided an opportunity for submitting written comments, data, and information by March 13, 2023. DOE received a request from Cleveland-Cliffs, Inc.; a joint request from the American Public Power Association (APPA), Edison Electric Institute (EEI) and the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA); and a request from the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) to extend the written comment period. DOE has reviewed these requests and is granting an extension of the comment period for 14 days to allow public comments to be submitted until March 27, 2023.
