## Summary

This notice announces actions taken by the FHWA, on behalf of the Nebraska Department of Transportation, that are final. The action(s) relate to the US-81 York-Columbus Project, located in York, Polk and Butler counties in Nebraska. Those actions grant licenses, permits, and approvals for the project. The project will expand the existing two-lane highway to a four-lane expressway, changing to three lanes in urban areas and returning to four lanes through the rural segments. The project starts near the north U.S. Highway 34 (US-34)/US- 81 intersection at the end of the existing four-lane York bypass. The project extends north to just north of the Nebraska Highway 64 (N-64) and US-81 intersection, where it connects to the existing four-lane roadway. The FHWA's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) provides details on the Selected Alternative for the proposed improvements.
