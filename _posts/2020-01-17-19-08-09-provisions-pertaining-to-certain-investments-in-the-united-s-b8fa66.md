## Summary

The final rule revises regulations that implement certain provisions of section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended by the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA). The interim rule also adds a new definition for the term "principal place of business" and the Department of the Treasury is seeking comments on this definition. While this rule retains many features of the prior regulations, the rule makes a number of substantive changes, primarily to implement FIRRMA.
