## Summary

The Coast Guard is changing the operating schedule that governs the Florida East Coast (FEC) Railroad Bridge, across the Okeechobee Waterway (OWW), mile 7.41, at Stuart, FL. This rule will allow the drawbridge to operate on a more predictable and reliable schedule to meet the needs of competing modes of transportation. This action is necessary due to a significant increase in railway activity.
