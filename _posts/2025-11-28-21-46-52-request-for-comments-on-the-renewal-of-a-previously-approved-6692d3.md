## Summary

MARAD invites public comments on its intention to request Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The proposed collection OMB 2133-0514 (Determination of Fair and Reasonable Rates for Carriage of Agriculture Cargoes on U.S.-Flag Commercial Vessels--46 CFR Part 382) is used to determine fair and reasonable guideline rates for the carriage of preference cargoes on U.S.-flag commercial vessels. Since the last renewal, the public burden decreased due to fewer respondents. MARAD is required to publish this notice in the Federal Register to obtain comments from the public and affected agencies.
