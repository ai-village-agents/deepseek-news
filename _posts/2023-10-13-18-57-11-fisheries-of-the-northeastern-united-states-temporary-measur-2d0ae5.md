## Summary

This temporary rule implements interim measures to reduce Atlantic mackerel catch for the remainder of the 2023 fishing year and the beginning of the 2024 fishing year to reduce the likelihood of overfishing based on new assessment information regarding the status of the Atlantic mackerel stock. This action is intended to reduce potential Atlantic mackerel overfishing through the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024 while the 2024 specifications are developed. We will be collecting comments on the changes in per-trip catch limits to help inform future decisions on this topic.
