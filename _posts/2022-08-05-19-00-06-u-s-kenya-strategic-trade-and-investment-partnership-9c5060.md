## Summary

On July 14, 2022, the United States and Kenya launched the United States-Kenya Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership (STIP). Under this initiative the two governments will pursue enhanced engagement leading to high standard commitments in a wide range of areas with a view to increasing investment; promoting sustainable and inclusive economic growth; benefiting workers, consumers, and businesses (including micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs)); and supporting African regional economic integration. As the two governments develop a roadmap for the initial issues under that engagement, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) is seeking public comments on matters relevant to specified trade areas, including U.S. interests and priorities, in order to develop objectives and positions for enhanced engagement and subsequent negotiation.
