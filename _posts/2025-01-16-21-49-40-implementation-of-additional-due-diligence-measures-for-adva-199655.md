## Summary

BIS is revising the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) in response to requests from the public to provide additional due diligence procedures regarding advanced computing integrated circuits (ICs). This interim final rule (IFR) will protect the national security of the United States and assist foundries and Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test ("OSATs") companies in complying with provisions of the EAR pertaining to advanced computing ICs in the supply chain. This IFR also revises the EAR to make amendments and clarifications to the EAR for changes made to the EAR in an IFR released by BIS on December 2, 2024, "Foreign-Produced Direct Product Rule Additions, and Refinements to Controls for Advanced Computing and Semiconductor Manufacturing Items," (FDP IFR), including extending the deadline for written comments for the FDP IFR to March 14, 2025.
