## Summary

MSHA is proposing to allow the use of electronic surveying equipment in high-hazard areas of underground coal mines, if the equipment meets certain technical specifications and is operated under specific conditions. This proposed rule would codify technical specifications and working conditions in MSHA standards to allow the use of electronic surveying equipment in underground gassy mines. This proposed rule would reduce burdens on underground coal mine operators because mine operators would no longer need to submit a petition for modification to use non-permissible electronic surveying equipment.
