## Summary

The Coast Guard has issued a temporary deviation from how the CSX Transportation railroad drawbridge across the Back Bay of Biloxi, mile 0.4, Biloxi, MS will be operated. The bridge will continue to open according to the drawbridge regulations but the bridge tender will operate this bridge from a remote location at the CSX railroad terminal in Mobile, Alabama. The Coast Guard is seeking comments from the public regarding these proposed changes.
