## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-19- 13, which applied to certain Airbus Helicopters Model EC225LP helicopters. AD 2019-19-13 required determining the total hours time- in-service (TIS) of the free wheel shafts of certain main rotor gearboxes (MGBs), replacing the MGB or right-hand side (RH) free wheel shaft, installing placard(s), and revising the rotorcraft flight manual (RFM) for the helicopter. Since the FAA issued AD 2019-19-13, an additional part-numbered MGB has been identified to have the same unsafe condition and the FAA determined that additional changes are necessary. This AD requires the actions of AD 2019-19-13 and expands the applicability by adding the additional part-numbered MGB, changes the requirement to determine the total hours TIS of a certain free wheel shaft, requires repetitive replacement of the MGB or the RH free wheel shaft, changes the requirements for who can replace parts, and expands the parts installation limitation conditions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
