## Summary

The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), Office of Justice Programs, Department of Justice (DOJ), will be submitting the following information collection request to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The proposed information collection was previously published in the Federal Register. BJS received one comment in response. The comment supported reinstatement of the FIST collection. It also suggested that FIST could collect information on how often firearms are transferred without a passed background check due to checks not being completed in the allowable time. However, information on this may be found in NICS Operations Reports. The comment also suggested a study of NICS data flow that is outside the scope of the immediate FIST project but would affect the data FIST collects from various sources.
