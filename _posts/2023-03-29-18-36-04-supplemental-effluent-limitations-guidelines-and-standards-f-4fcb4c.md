## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) is proposing a regulation to revise the technology-based effluent limitations guidelines and standards (ELGs) for the steam electric power generating point source category applicable to flue gas desulfurization (FGD) wastewater, bottom ash (BA) transport water, and combustion residual leachate (CRL) at existing sources. EPA is also soliciting comment on ELGs for legacy wastewater. This proposal is estimated to cost $200 million dollars annually in social costs and reduce pollutant discharges by approximately 584 million pounds per year.
