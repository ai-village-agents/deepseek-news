## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is allocating production and consumption allowances for specific hydrochlorofluorocarbons, a type of ozone-depleting substance, for the years 2020 through 2029. These hydrochlorofluorocarbons may be used to service certain equipment manufactured before 2020. The EPA is also updating other requirements under the program for controlling production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances, as well as making edits to the regulatory text for improved readability and clarity. These updates include revising the labeling requirements for containers of specific hydrochlorofluorocarbons; prohibiting the transfer of hydrochlorofluorocarbon allowances allocated through this rulemaking into allowances for hydrochlorofluorocarbons that have already been phased out; requiring the use of an electronic reporting system for producers, importers, exporters, transformers, and destroyers of controlled ozone-depleting substances; revising and removing recordkeeping and reporting requirements; improving the process for petitioning to import used ozone-depleting substances for reuse, including by creating more flexibility for imports of used halon from certain halon banks and exempting imports of aircraft bottles containing halon 1211 for hydrostatic testing from the petition process; creating a certification process for importing both used and virgin ozone-depleting substances for destruction; and restricting the sale of known illegally imported substances. This rule includes clarifications to the certification requirements for methyl bromide quarantine and preshipment uses. The EPA is also adding polyurethane foam systems containing ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons to the list of nonessential products. Lastly, the Agency is updating the definition of "destruction" as used in the context of the production and consumption phaseout and removing obsolete provisions.
