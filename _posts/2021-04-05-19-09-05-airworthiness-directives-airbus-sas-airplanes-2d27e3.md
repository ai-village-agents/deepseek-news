## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A318, A319, A320, and A321 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that the oil used to protect the nose landing gear (NLG) main fittings for transportation and storage was not removed before final heat treatment of the affected parts, possibly generating sub-surface cavities during heat treatment of the affected parts. This AD requires replacing each affected NLG main fitting with a serviceable part, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
