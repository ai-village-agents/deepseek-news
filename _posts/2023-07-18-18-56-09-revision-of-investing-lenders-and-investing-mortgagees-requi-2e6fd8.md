## Summary

HUD proposes to revise the requirements for investing lenders and investing mortgagees to gain or maintain status as a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) approved lender or mortgagee. This proposed revision would make FHA's approval requirements consistent with investing mortgagees' and investing lenders' risk, reduce barriers to FHA approval for new investing mortgagees and investing lenders, and increase access to capital for all FHA-approved mortgagees and lenders. HUD also proposes to make clarifying edits to ensure that certification language is applicable to investing lenders and investing mortgagees. In addition, HUD proposes to define the Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) separately from other governmental-type entities to ensure that FHA requirements specific to loan origination do not improperly apply to the GSEs. Finally, HUD proposes to eliminate obsolete language related to lender and mortgagee net worth requirements.
