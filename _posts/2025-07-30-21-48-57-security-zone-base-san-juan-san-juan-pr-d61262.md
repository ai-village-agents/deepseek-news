## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to revise the Base San Juan security zone in San Juan Puerto Rico. This action is needed for national security reasons to protect the public and the Coast Guard base from potential subversive acts. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the security zone extending 120 yards seaward from the water's edge of the Coast Guard Base San Juan unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Sector San Juan or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
