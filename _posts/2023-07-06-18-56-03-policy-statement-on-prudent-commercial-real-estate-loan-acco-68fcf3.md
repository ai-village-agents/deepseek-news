## Summary

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) (the agencies), in consultation with state bank and credit union regulators, are issuing a final policy statement for prudent commercial real estate loan accommodations and workouts. The statement is relevant to all financial institutions supervised by the agencies. This updated policy statement builds on existing supervisory guidance calling for financial institutions to work prudently and constructively with creditworthy borrowers during times of financial stress, updates existing interagency supervisory guidance on commercial real estate loan workouts, and adds a section on short-term loan accommodations. The updated statement also addresses relevant accounting standard changes on estimating loan losses and provides updated examples of classifying and accounting for loans modified or affected by loan accommodations or loan workout activity.
