## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2016-08-20 for certain Airbus Helicopters (previously Eurocopter France) EC130B4 and EC130T2 helicopters. AD 2016-08-20 required repetitively inspecting the tail boom to Fenestron junction frame (junction frame) for a crack. This new AD continues to require inspecting the junction frame with the horizontal stabilizer removed, and expands the applicability, revises the compliance time and the inspection procedures for inspecting the junction frame, adds inspection procedures for certain helicopters, allows repair of the junction frame, and requires modifying and then repetitively inspecting the junction frame and reporting certain information. This AD was prompted by additional cracks and the availability of a design change that modifies the junction frame. The actions of this AD are intended to address an unsafe condition on these products.
