## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-05-03 for certain Airbus Helicopters Model EC225LP helicopters. AD 2021-05-03 required various inspections of a certain part-numbered left-hand (LH) engine fuel supply (fuel supply) hose and depending on the inspection results, reinstalling or removing the fuel supply hose from service. AD 2021-05-03 also required installing an improved part and prohibited installing an affected fuel supply hose on any helicopter unless it was installed by following certain procedures. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-05-03, there were reports of difficulties using an adjusting tool to install the improved fuel supply hose. This AD continues to require the actions of AD 2021-05-03, expands the applicability, expands the parts installation limitations, and requires using an improved adjusting tool and updated procedures. This AD also updates certain compliance times and clarifies certain requirements. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
