## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-12-11, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -151N, and -153N airplanes; Model A320-251N, -252N, -253N, -271N, -272N, and -273N airplanes; and Model A321-251N, -251NX, -252N, -252NX, -253N, -253NX, -271N, -271NX, -272N, and -272NX airplanes. AD 2020-12-11 requires revising the airplane flight manual (AFM) and applicable corresponding operational procedures to limit the use of speed brakes in certain airplane configurations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD. This AD was prompted by a determination that, for certain airplanes, updated flight guidance (FG) 3G standard software for the flight management and guidance computer (FMGC) has been developed to address the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2020-12-11 and would require, for certain airplanes, installing updated FG 3G standard software, and would prohibit the installation of affected FG standards, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
