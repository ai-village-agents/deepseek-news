## Summary

In response to several petitions for reconsideration, FMCSA proposes to revise from 14 days to 30 days the length of the emergency relief automatically triggered subsequent to a regional declaration of emergency by a Governor of a State, their authorized representative, or FMCSA. This proposal would reverse one change made by a final rule published in October of 2023.
