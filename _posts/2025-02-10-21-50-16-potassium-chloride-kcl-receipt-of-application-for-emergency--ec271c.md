## Summary

EPA is announcing a quarantine exemption request from the Idaho State Department of Agriculture (ISDA) to use the pesticide potassium chloride (CAS No. 7440-09-7) to treat up to 1.26 acres to control Quagga mussels. The applicant proposes the use of a new chemical which has not been registered by EPA. Due to the urgent nature of the emergency and the very narrow and limited use being requested EPA has eliminated the public comment period. Nonetheless, interested parties may still contact the Agency with information about this notice and treatment program.
