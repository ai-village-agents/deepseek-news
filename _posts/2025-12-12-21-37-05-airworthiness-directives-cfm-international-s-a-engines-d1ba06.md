## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain CFM International, S.A. (CFM) Model LEAP-1A23, LEAP-1A24, LEAP- 1A24E1, LEAP-1A26, LEAP-1A26CJ, LEAP-1A26E1, LEAP-1A29, LEAP-1A29CJ, LEAP-1A30, LEAP-1A32, LEAP-1A33, LEAP-1A33B2, and LEAP-1A35A engines. This AD was prompted by reports of two in-flight shutdowns and subsequent investigation by the manufacturer that revealed cracks in the high-pressure turbine (HPT) rotor stage 1 blades. This AD requires initial and repetitive borescope inspections (BSIs) of the HPT rotor stage 1 blades. Depending on the results of the BSIs, this AD requires either additional BSIs at reduced intervals or replacement of the HPT rotor stage 1 blades. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
