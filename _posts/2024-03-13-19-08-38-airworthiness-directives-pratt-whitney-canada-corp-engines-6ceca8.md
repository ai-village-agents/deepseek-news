## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Pratt & Whitney Canada Corp. (P&WC) Model PT6A-64, PT6A-66, PT6A-66A, PT6A-66B, PT6A-66D, PT6A-67, PT6A-67A, PT6A-67AF, PT6A-67AG, PT6A-67B, PT6A-67D, PT6A-67F, PT6A-67P, PT6A-67R, PT6A-67RM, PT6A-67T, PT6A-68, PT6A-68D, PT6E-67XP, and PT6E-66XT engines. The FAA previously sent this AD as an emergency AD to all known U.S. owners and operators of these engines. This AD was prompted by reports of second-stage power turbine (PT2) blade failures. This AD requires removal of affected PT2 blades prior to the next flight and prohibits installation of affected PT2 blades, as specified in a Transport Canada Emergency AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
