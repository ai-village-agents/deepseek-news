## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Textron Aviation Inc. (type certificate previously held by Cessna Aircraft Company) (Textron) Model 210N, 210R, P210N, P210R, T210N, T210R, 177, 177A, 177B, 177RG, and F177RG airplanes. This AD was prompted by the in-flight break-up of a Model T210M airplane in Australia, due to fatigue cracking that initiated at a corrosion pit, and subsequent corrosion reports on other Model 210- and 177-series airplanes. This AD requires visual and eddy current inspections of the carry-thru spar lower cap for corrosion, cracking, and damage; corrective action if necessary; application of a protective coating and corrosion inhibiting compound (CIC); and reporting the inspection results to the FAA. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
