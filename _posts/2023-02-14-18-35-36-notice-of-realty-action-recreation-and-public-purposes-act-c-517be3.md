## Summary

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Humboldt River Field Office, has examined certain public lands in Humboldt County, Nevada, and has found them suitable for classification for conveyance to Humboldt County under the provisions of the Recreation and Public Purposes (R&PP) Act, as amended. Humboldt County currently operates a public shooting range that was patented pursuant to the Act of September 19, 1964, and recently applied for approximately 240 acres of adjoining public lands to expand the operation. The expansion would add a rifle range up to 1,000-yards, a buffer area, and an extended safety zone.
