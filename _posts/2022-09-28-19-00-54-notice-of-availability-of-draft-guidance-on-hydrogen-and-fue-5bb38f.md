## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announces the notice of availability (NOA) and invites public comment on its Clean Hydrogen Production Standard (CHPS) Draft Guidance. The draft guidance contains the initial proposal for the CHPS, as required by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). Specifically, in the draft guidance, DOE establishes a target for the lifecycle (i.e., well-to-gate) emissions intensity of hydrogen production, based on the IIJA definition of the term "clean hydrogen" and other factors set forth in section 40315(b) of the IIJA.
