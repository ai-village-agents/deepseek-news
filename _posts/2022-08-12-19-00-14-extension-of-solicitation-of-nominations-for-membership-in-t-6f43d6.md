## Summary

As announced in the June 15, 2022 Federal Register, the Department of Commerce renewed the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Advisory Committee (the Committee) for the 2022-2024 term and requested nominations for membership. This notice extends the solicitation period for membership on the Committee in order to widen the pool of qualified candidates and to ensure that diverse points of view are represented. All nominations previously received pursuant to the June 15, 2022 Federal Register will be duly considered during the extended solicitation period and should not be resubmitted. The Committee shall advise the Secretary of Commerce regarding the development and administration of programs and policies to expand the competitiveness of U.S. exports of renewable energy and energy efficiency goods and services. The Committee's work on renewable energy will focus on technologies, equipment, and services to generate electricity, produce heat, and power vehicles from renewable sources such as solar, wind, biomass, hydropower, geothermal, and hydrogen. The Committee's work on energy efficiency will focus on technologies, services, and platforms that provide system-level energy efficiency to electricity generation, transmission, and distribution. These include smart grid technologies and services, as well as equipment and systems that increase the resiliency of power infrastructure such as energy storage. Climate solutions in the energy sector, such as low-carbon hydrogen production, clean energy transportation, and virtual power plants are also within the scope of the Committee. For the purposes of this Committee, covered goods and services will not include vehicles, feedstock for biofuels, or energy efficiency as it relates to consumer goods or buildings. Non-fossil fuels that reduce carbon consumption (e.g., liquid biofuels and pellets) are included.
