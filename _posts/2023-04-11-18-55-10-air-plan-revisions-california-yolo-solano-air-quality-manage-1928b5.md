## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to partially approve and partially disapprove, under the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act"), a revision to the California state implementation plan (SIP). This revision addresses reasonably available control technology (RACT) requirements for the 2008 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or "standards") in the portion of the Sacramento Metropolitan nonattainment area that is subject to the jurisdiction of the Yolo-Solano Air Quality Management District (YSAQMD). We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
