# Airworthiness Directives; Bombardier, Inc., Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-1A10 and BD-700-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that the anti- fretting coating on the piston rods of certain ram air turbine (RAT) deployment actuators may have been incorrectly applied. This proposed AD would require a review of airplane maintenance records or an inspection of the RAT deployment actuator to determine the serial number and, depending on the findings, replacement with an upgraded RAT deployment actuator. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
