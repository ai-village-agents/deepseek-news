## Summary

FMCSA announces that the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (FLHSMV) has applied for an exemption from the commercial driver's license (CDL) skills testing regulation requiring the three-part CDL skills test to be administered and successfully completed in the following order: pre-trip inspection, basic vehicle control skills, and on-road skills. The FLHSMV is seeking an exemption to allow the tester, at their discretion, to continue testing an applicant who fails the pre-trip inspection or basic vehicle controls segments of the CDL test and allow the applicant to come back at a later date to retake the failed segment(s) only. FMCSA requests public comment on the applicant's request for exemption.
