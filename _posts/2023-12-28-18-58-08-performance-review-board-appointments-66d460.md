## Summary

This notice announces the appointment of those individuals who have been selected to serve as members of the Performance Review Board (PRB). The PRB is comprised of two career senior executives and one non-career executive that will meet annually to review and evaluate performance appraisal documents for all Senior Executive Service (SES) members. The National Mediation Board (NMB) is headed by a three-member board nominated by the President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The members self-designate a Chairman, typically on a yearly basis. Members may continue to serve after their three-year terms are up if they are not replaced. The PRB provides a written recommendation to the appointing authority. The current Board Chairman or Acting Board Chairman is the appointing authority for the National Mediation Board for final approval of each SES and SL performance rating, performance- based pay adjustment, and performance award.
