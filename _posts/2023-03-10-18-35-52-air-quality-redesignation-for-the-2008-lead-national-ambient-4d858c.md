## Summary

This final rule redesignates a portion of Canton, Ohio in northeastern Stark County from "unclassifiable/ attainment" to "nonattainment" for the 2008 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for lead (Pb). The EPA notified the state of Ohio of its intended redesignation of portions of Stark County on April 26, 2022, and published a Notice of Availability for this action on May 3, 2022. The EPA's redesignation of this portion of the Canton, Ohio area is based on recorded violations of the Pb NAAQS at the Republic Steel ambient air monitoring site operated by Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio EPA) located in Canton, Ohio.
