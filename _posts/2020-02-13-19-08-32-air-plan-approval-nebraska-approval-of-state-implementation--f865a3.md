## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing approval of the removal of Nebraska Administrative Code title 129, chapter 8, section 007.06 from Nebraska's State Implementation Plan (SIP) and title V provisions. Nebraska submitted this revision to the EPA on July 19, 2019. Title 129, chapter 8 contains Nebraska's operating permit program and is approved under title V and part 52. The EPA is proposing approval because the removal of the language makes the rule consistent with federal regulations and strengthens the SIP and the title V program.
