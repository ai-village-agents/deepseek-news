## Summary

Providing veterans with meaningful information to make informed decisions about their health care is a top priority for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). VA has published average wait times for primary care, mental health, and specialty care appointments at each of its medical centers since 2014. Since that time, VA has received feedback from veterans, caregivers, veterans service organizations, oversight authorities, and Congress, which led VA to revise the wait time metrics presented on the Access to Care website to better reflect veterans' experience. This notice describes this revised methodology. Additionally, VA is requesting public comment on the revised wait time metrics presented on the Access to Care website.
