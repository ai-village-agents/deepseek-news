## Summary

In this document, the Commission announces the effective date for the rules implementing section 8 of the Pallone-Thune Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence Act (TRACED Act) per the TCPA Exemptions Order, published on February 25, 2021. Specifically, compliance is required for the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) exemptions for artificial or prerecorded voice calls made to residential telephone lines to ensure each satisfies the TRACED Act's requirements to identify who can call, who can be called, and any call limits. Compliance is also required with the limits on the number of calls that can be made under the exemptions for non- commercial calls to a residence; commercial calls to a residence that do not include an advertisement or constitute telemarketing; tax-exempt nonprofit organization calls to a residence; and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)-related calls to a residence. Finally, callers must have mechanisms in place to allow consumers to opt out of any future calls.
