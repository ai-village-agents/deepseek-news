## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-19-08 which applied to all Airbus Helicopters Model SA341G and SA342J helicopters. AD 2022-19-08 was prompted by a report of manufacturing defects on multiple tail rotor blades (TRBs) and required visually inspecting certain part-numbered TRBs for the presence of a linear indication, and, depending on the inspection results, fluorescent penetrant inspecting the TRB and further corrective actions if necessary. AD 2022-19-08 also prohibited installing an affected TRB unless certain requirements had been met. This AD was prompted by the determination that parts that have accumulated more than 500 flight hours (FH) since new are also affected by the unsafe condition. In addition, the defined compliance time for the visual inspection of the root area of each affected part was determined to be too strict. This AD retains certain requirements of AD 2022-19-08, includes all TRBs in the inspection requirements, and increases a compliance time as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA previously sent this AD as an emergency AD to all known U.S. owners and operators of these helicopters. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
