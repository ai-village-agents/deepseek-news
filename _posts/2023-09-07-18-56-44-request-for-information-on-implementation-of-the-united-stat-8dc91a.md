## Summary

NIST is seeking information on behalf of the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Government to support the development of an implementation plan for the United States Government National Standards Strategy for Critical and Emerging Technology (USG NSSCET). The USG NSSCET is intended to support and complement existing private sector- led activities and plans, including the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) United States Standards Strategy (USSS), with a focus on critical and emerging technology(ies) (CET). The USG NSSCET reinforces the U.S. Government's support of a private sector-led, open, consensus-based international standards system, corresponding to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee decision that articulates and elaborates on principles that are fundamental to the development of an international standards: transparency; openness; impartiality and consensus; effectiveness and relevance; and coherence. To inform the USG NSSCET implementation, including how to best partner with relevant stakeholders, NIST is requesting information that will support the identification and prioritization of key activities that will optimize the USG NSSCET implementation and further enhance the U.S. Government's ability to support a private sector-led, open, consensus-based international standards system, to which the U.S. Government is an active stakeholder and participant.
