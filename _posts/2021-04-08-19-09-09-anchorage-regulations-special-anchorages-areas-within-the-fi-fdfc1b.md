## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to revise the notes for its First Coast Guard District special anchorage area regulations and to remove language from the text of four of these regulations because those provisions are inconsistent with simply designating the location of a special anchorage area. These existing notes and regulatory text provisions, which contain obsolete and duplicative language, would be replaced with a note in a new section we are adding that would apply to all special anchorage area regulations in the First Coast Guard District. The note would advise interested persons that state and local regulations may apply and that they should contact other authorities, such as the local harbormaster, to ensure compliance with any such applicable regulations. These changes are primarily editorial in nature and are intended to clarify and update First Coast Guard District special anchorage area regulations. This proposed rule would not create, remove, or change any previously established special anchorage areas in the First Coast Guard District.
