## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (AHD) Model EC135P1, EC135P2, EC135P2+, EC135P3, EC135T1, EC135T2, EC135T2+, and EC135T3 helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of restricted collective lever movement caused by entanglement of the emergency flashlight strap with the cargo hook emergency release lever, causing the emergency flashlight to leave its seat. This AD requires replacing each affected emergency flashlight with a serviceable part, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
