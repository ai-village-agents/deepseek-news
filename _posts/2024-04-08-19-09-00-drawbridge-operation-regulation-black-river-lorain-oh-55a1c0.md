## Summary

The Coast Guard is altering the operating schedule that governs the Charles Berry Bridge, mile 0.6, and the Norfolk Southern Railroad Bridge, mile 1.2, both over the Black River. The regulation has remained primarily unchanged since 1986 and needs to be updated to ensure the needs of all modes of transportation are being met.
