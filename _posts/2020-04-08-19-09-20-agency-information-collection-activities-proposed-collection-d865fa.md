## Summary

NARA proposes to request an extension from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) of approval to use three information collections. The first is prepared by organizations that want to make paper-to-paper copies of archival holdings with their personal copiers at the National Archives at the College Park facility. The second is used to advise requesters of the correct procedures to follow when requesting certified copies of records for use in civil litigation or criminal actions in courts of law, and the information to be provided so that records may be identified. The third information collection is used by veterans, dependents, and other authorized individuals to request information from or copies of documents in military personnel, military medical, and dependent medical records. We invite you to comment on this proposed information collection pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
