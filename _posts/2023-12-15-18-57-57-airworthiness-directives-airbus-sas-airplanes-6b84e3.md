## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-24-20, which apply to all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes, and AD 2023-03-05, which apply to certain Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. AD 2021-24-20 requires repetitive water drainage and plug cleaning of the left- and right-hand slat geared rotary actuators (SGRAs) having a certain part number installed on slat 5 track 12 with certain functional item numbers. AD 2023-03-05 requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-24-20 and AD 2023-03-05, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would continue to require certain actions in AD 2021- 24-20 and AD 2023-03-05 and would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
