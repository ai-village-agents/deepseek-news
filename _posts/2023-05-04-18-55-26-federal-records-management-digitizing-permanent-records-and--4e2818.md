## Summary

The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is amending our records management regulations to add a subpart containing standards for digitizing permanent Federal records so that agencies may dispose of the source records, when appropriate and in accordance with the Federal Records Act amendments of 2014. NARA is also amending our records management regulations to add a subpart containing metadata requirements for transferring permanent digital records to the National Archives of the United States. Finally, NARA is making a revision to our records schedule review provisions to establish a requirement for agencies to review, every five years, all records schedules that are ten years old and older, based on the date NARA approved the schedule.
