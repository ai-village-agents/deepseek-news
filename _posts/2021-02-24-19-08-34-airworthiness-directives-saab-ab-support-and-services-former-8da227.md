## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Saab AB, Support and Services Model SAAB 2000 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report indicating that the left-hand main landing gear (MLG) collapsed after touchdown, causing severe damage to the airplane. This proposed AD would require modifying the MLG hydraulic transfer valve, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
