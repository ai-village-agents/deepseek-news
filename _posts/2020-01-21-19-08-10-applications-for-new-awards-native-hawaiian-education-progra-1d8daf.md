## Summary

On December 13, 2019, we published in the Federal Register a notice inviting applications (NIA) for new awards for fiscal year (FY) 2020 for the Native Hawaiian Education (NHE) program, Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) number 84.362A. Since that time, Congress passed and the President signed the Department of Education Appropriations Act, 2020 (Act), which provides funding for the awards under this competition. For fiscal year (FY) 2020, the Act overrides the limitation in section 6205(b) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESEA), to provide that the 5 percent limitation on the use of funds for administrative purposes applies only to direct administrative costs. This document amends the NIA to clearly indicate that the administrative cost cap in ESEA section 6205(b) applies only to direct administrative costs for grants awarded using FY 2020 appropriations.
