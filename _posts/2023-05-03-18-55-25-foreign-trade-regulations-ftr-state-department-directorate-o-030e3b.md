## Summary

The Census Bureau is proposing to amend its regulations to reflect new export reporting requirements related to the State Department, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) Category XXI Determination Number. Specifically, the Census Bureau is proposing to add a conditional data element, DDTC Category XXI Determination Number, when "21" is selected in the DDTC USML Category Code field in the Automated Export System (AES) to represent United States Munitions List (USML) Category XXI. In addition to the new export reporting requirement, the proposed rule would make remedial changes to the Foreign Trade Regulations (FTR) to update International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) references in existing data elements: DDTC Significant Military Equipment Indicator and DDTC Eligible Party Certification Indicator. The proposed rule also makes remedial changes to the FTR that were proposed in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published December 15, 2021.
