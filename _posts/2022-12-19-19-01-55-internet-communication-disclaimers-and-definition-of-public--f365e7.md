## Summary

The Commission is adopting final rules to amend its regulations concerning disclaimers on public communications on the internet. The Commission is implementing these amendments in light of technological advances since the Commission last revised its rules governing internet disclaimers in 2006, and to address questions from the public about the application of those rules to internet communications. The Commission's purpose in promulgating these rules is to apply the Federal Election Campaign Act's disclaimer requirements to general public political advertising on the internet. The Commission is also revising the definition of "public communication" to clarify how it applies to general public political advertising on the internet.
