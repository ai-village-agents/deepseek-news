## Summary

The FDIC, as part of its obligations under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, invites the general public and other Federal agencies to take this opportunity to comment on the request to renew the existing information collection (OMB Control No. 3064-0215) for its eighth biennial survey of households, which has been renamed the FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households (Household Survey). This survey was previously named the Survey of Household Use of Banking and Financial Services. The Household Survey is scheduled to be conducted in partnership with the U.S. Census Bureau as a supplement to its June 2023 Current Population Survey (CPS). The survey collects information on U.S. households' use of bank accounts, prepaid cards, nonbank online payment services and nonbank financial transaction services, and bank and nonbank credit. The results of these biennial surveys will be published by the FDIC, and help inform policymakers, bankers, and researchers about bank account ownership and how households use the banking system and nonbank products and services to meet their financial needs. On November 14, 2022, the FDIC requested comment for 60 days on the proposed information collection. No comments were received. The FDIC hereby gives notice of its plan to submit to OMB a request to approve this information collection, and again invites comment on the information collection.
