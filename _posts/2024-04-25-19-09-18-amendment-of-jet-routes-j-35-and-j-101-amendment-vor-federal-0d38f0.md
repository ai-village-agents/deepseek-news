## Summary

This action proposes to amend Jet Routes J-35 and J-101; amend Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal Airways V-9, V- 48, V-69, V-227, and V-313; and revoke VOR Federal Airway V-586. The FAA is proposing this action due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Pontiac, IL (PNT), VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) navigational aid (NAVAID). The Pontiac VOR is being decommissioned in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
