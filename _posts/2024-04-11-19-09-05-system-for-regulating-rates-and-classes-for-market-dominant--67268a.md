## Summary

The Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeks comment on the Commission's review of the system for regulating rates and classes for Market Dominant products (ratemaking system). The Commission previously reviewed the ratemaking system and adopted final rules via Order No. 5763. After the final rules took effect on January 14, 2021, the Postal Service filed five notices proposing to adjust rates for Market Dominant products, and Market Dominant volume and pieces have declined year-over-year. These declines and stakeholder concerns prompted the Commission to initiate another review of the ratemaking system. This document informs the public of the filing, invites public comment, and takes other administrative steps.
