## Summary

These special conditions are issued for the Airbus Helicopters (Airbus) Model H160-B helicopter. This helicopter has a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for helicopters. This design feature is the extended duration of continued safe flight and landing beyond 30 minutes after indication to the flightcrew of the loss of main gearbox lubrication. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
