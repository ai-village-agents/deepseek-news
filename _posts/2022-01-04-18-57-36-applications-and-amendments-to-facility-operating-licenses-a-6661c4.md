## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) received and is considering approval of three amendment requests. The amendment requests are for Three Mile Island, Unit 2, Quad Cities Nuclear Power Station, Units 1 and 2, and Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant, Units 1 and 2. For each amendment request, the NRC proposes to determine that the request involves no significant hazards consideration (NSHC). Because each amendment request contains sensitive unclassified non-safeguards information (SUNSI), an order imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI for contention preparation by persons who file a hearing request or petition for leave to intervene.
