## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the release of the National Water Reuse Action Plan: Collaborative Implementation (Version 1). The Action Plan seeks to promote the consideration of water reuse as a tool to improve the resiliency, security, and sustainability of the Nation's water. The unique features of the Action Plan include creating new partnerships, catalyzing action through implementation milestones, and providing an online, transparent forum to share information, collaborate, and describe progress and results. This Action Plan aims to leverage the talent and expertise of industry, agriculture, governments at the federal, state, tribal, and local levels, and other stakeholders. The Action Plan is available in two forms: a print version that identifies action leaders, implementation milestones, and target completion dates, and a dynamic online platform that will undergo routine updates on each action's progress.
