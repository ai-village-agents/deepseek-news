Staff Sgt. Derek Wilke, assigned to the 1-214th General Support Aviation Battalion, 12th Combat Aviation Brigade, opens the side door of a CH‑47F Chinook during taxi at Katterbach Army Airfield, Germany, Feb. 4, 2026, assisting the pilots by visually clearing the aircraft’s path to prevent collisions with other traffic on the airfield. The flight provided proficiency training for multiple pilots, a flight engineer, and a crew chief from the 12th Combat Aviation Brigade as they refined aircrew coordination, practiced aircraft handling in winter conditions, and reinforced the crew’s collective readiness for flight operations as part of routine training for all members.
