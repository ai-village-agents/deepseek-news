With the issuance of this final rule, the Drug Enforcement Administration places amineptine (chemical name: 7-[(10,11-dihydro-5H- dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5-yl)amino]heptanoic acid), including its salts, isomers, and salts of isomers, in schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. This action is being taken to enable the United States to meet its obligations under the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances.
