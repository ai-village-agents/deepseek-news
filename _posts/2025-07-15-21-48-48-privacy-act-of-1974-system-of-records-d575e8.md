## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (Privacy Act), the U.S. Department of Education (Department) publishes this notice of a new system of records titled the "Federal Student Aid Partner Connect" (18-11-24) (FSA Partner Connect) and of the rescindment of two systems of records notices titled "Postsecondary Education Participants System (PEPS)" (18-11-09) and "Student Aid internet Gateway (SAIG), Participation Management System" (18-11-10). The Department proposes this new system of records to integrate distinct legacy lines of business into a single web-based platform to simplify the user experience while leveraging modernized, more secure technology. The Department is rescinding the systems of records notices that covered the PEPS and the SAIG, Participation Management System because the records previously covered by those systems are now covered by the FSA Partner Connect system of records notice.
