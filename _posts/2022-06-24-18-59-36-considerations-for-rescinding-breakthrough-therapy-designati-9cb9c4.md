## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled "Considerations for Rescinding Breakthrough Therapy Designation." This guidance explains how, during its evaluation of a drug development program, FDA may consider whether to rescind a breakthrough therapy designation (BTD) that has been granted. The guidance is consistent with, and supplements, the information on BTD contained in the guidance for industry entitled "Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions-- Drugs and Biologics" (May 2014) and in other BTD policies and procedures of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) to expedite the development and review of a breakthrough therapy.
