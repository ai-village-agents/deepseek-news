## Summary

The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), announces the availability of our draft Update to: Technical Guidance for Assessing the Effects of Anthropogenic Sound on Marine Mammal Hearing (Version 3.0): Underwater and In-Air Criteria for Onset of Auditory Injury and Temporary Threshold Shifts (draft Updated Technical Guidance) for public comment. The draft Updated Technical Guidance assesses the effects of anthropogenic sound on marine mammal species under NMFS's jurisdiction. The draft Updated Technical Guidance provides updated received levels and auditory weighting functions, or acoustic criteria, above which individual marine mammals, in-air and underwater, are predicted to experience changes in their hearing sensitivity (auditory injury or temporary threshold shift) for all anthropogenic sound sources. Once finalized, the Updated Technical Guidance will replace NMFS's current 2018 Revisions to: Technical Guidance for Assessing the Effects of Anthropogenic Sound on Marine Mammal Hearing (Version 2.0): Underwater Thresholds for Onset of Permanent and Temporary Threshold Shifts (2018 Revised Technical Guidance).
