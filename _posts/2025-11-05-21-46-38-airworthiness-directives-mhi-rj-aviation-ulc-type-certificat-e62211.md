## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain MHI RJ Aviation ULC (type certificate previously held by Bombardier, Inc.) Model CL-600-2C10 (Regional Jet Series 700, 701 & 702), CL-600-2C11 (Regional Jet Series 550), CL-600-2D15 (Regional Jet Series 705), CL-600-2D24 (Regional Jet Series 900), and CL-600-2E25 (Regional Jet Series 1000) airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of loose and missing bolts on the horizontal stabilizer (H-stab) anti- yaw steady fitting block. This AD requires repetitive torque checks of the H-stab anti-yaw steady fitting block bolts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
