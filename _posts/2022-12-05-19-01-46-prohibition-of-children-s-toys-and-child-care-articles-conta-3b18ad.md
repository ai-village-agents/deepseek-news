## Summary

The Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission or CPSC) is publishing this document in response to a federal court decision remanding the Commission's final phthalates rule, without vacatur, to allow the Commission to address two procedural deficiencies the court found. This document provides notice of the availability of CPSC staff's memorandum responding to public comments on the justification for the phthalates final rule and on the staff's cost-benefit analysis of continuing the interim prohibition on diisononyl phthalate (DINP). This document also provides the Commission's finding that further rulemaking is not warranted at this time.
