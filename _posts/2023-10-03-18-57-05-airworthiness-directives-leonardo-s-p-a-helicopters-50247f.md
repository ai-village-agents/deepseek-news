## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Leonardo S.p.a. Model A109E, A109S, AW109SP, A119, and AW119 MKII helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by multiple reports of excessive axial play on the ball bearing of the lower half of the main rotor (MR) rotating scissor assembly. This proposed AD would require one-time scissor coupling and axial play inspections and repetitive quantitative axial play inspections and, depending on the results, additional inspections and replacing certain parts. This proposed AD would also require reporting information and prohibit installing certain parts unless certain inspections have been accomplished as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
