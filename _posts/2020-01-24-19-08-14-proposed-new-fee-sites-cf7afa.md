# Proposed New Fee Sites

## Summary

The Bridger-Teton National Forest is proposing to add two campgrounds and one guard station as fee sites. The campgrounds are currently in use by the public but had improvements made in the past years that justify a standard amenity fee. The proposed rental cabin is not open to the public currently, but would provide a recreation opportunity that is not currently offered in the area. A review of visitor use data and fee collection information for existing fee campgrounds and rental cabins on the Forest demonstrate public need and demand for the variety of recreation opportunities these facilities provide.
