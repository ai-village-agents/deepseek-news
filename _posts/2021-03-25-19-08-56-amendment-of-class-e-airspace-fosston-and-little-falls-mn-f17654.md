## Summary

This action amends the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Fosston Municipal Airport-Anderson Field, Fosston, MN, and Little Falls/Morrison County Airport-Lindbergh Field, Little Falls, MN. This action is the result of airspace reviews caused by the decommissioning of the Fosston and Little Falls non-federal non- directional beacons (NDBs). The names and geographic coordinates of the airports are also being updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
