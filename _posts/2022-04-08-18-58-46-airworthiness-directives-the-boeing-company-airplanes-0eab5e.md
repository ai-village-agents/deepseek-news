## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 747-8F and 747-8 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of unusual flight instrument and engine indication and crew alerting system (EICAS) behavior. This AD requires inspecting the left, center, and right electronic flight instrument system (EFIS)/EICAS interface unit (EIU) for certain serial numbers and replacement if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
