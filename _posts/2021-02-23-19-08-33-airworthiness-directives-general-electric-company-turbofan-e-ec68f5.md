## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all General Electric Company (GE) GEnx-1B64, -1B64/P1, -1B64/P2, -1B67, - 1B67/P1, -1B67/P2, -1B70, -1B70/75/P1, -1B70/75/P2, -1B70/P1, -1B70/P2, -1B70C/P1, -1B70C/P2, -1B74/75/P1, -1B74/75/P2, -1B76/P2, and -1B76A/P2 model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by a report of a crack in the outer fuel manifold causing fuel leakage. This AD requires initial and repetitive visual inspections of the cushioned loop clamp (p-clamp) and, depending on the results of the inspection, a spot fluorescent penetrant inspection (FPI) of the outer fuel manifold. Depending on the results of the FPI, this AD may require replacement of the outer fuel manifold. This AD also requires initial and repetitive replacements of the p-clamp. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
