## Summary

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (together referred to as the agencies, and each, individually, the agency) are issuing this supplemental rulemaking related to the agencies' Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) final rule issued on October 24, 2023, and published in the Federal Register on February 1, 2024 (2023 CRA Final Rule). The rulemaking has two components. First, the agencies are adopting an interim final rule that amends, and requests comment on, the applicability date of the facility-based assessment areas provision and public file provision included in the 2023 CRA Final Rule. Second, the agencies are adopting a final rule that makes technical amendments to the 2023 CRA Final Rule and related regulations. In addition to the rulemaking, this document makes a correction to the preamble to the 2023 CRA Final Rule regarding the OCC's Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) regulatory analysis.
