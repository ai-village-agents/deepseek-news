## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500- 1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that some tie-rod assemblies may have been overtightened during the installation of interior monuments (such as galleys, lavatories, and forward stowage or wardrobes). This AD requires adjusting the tie-rod assemblies, as specified in a Transport Canada Civil Aviation (TCCA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
