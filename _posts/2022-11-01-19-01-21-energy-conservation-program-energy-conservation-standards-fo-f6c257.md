## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") announces the availability of the preliminary analysis it has conducted for purposes of evaluating the needed for amended energy conservation standards for consumer furnace fans, which is set forth in the Department's preliminary technical support document ("TSD") for this rulemaking. DOE will hold a public meeting via webinar to discuss and receive comment on the preliminary analysis. The meeting will cover the analytical framework, models, and tools used to evaluate potential standards; the results of preliminary analyses performed by DOE; the potential energy conservation standard levels derived from these analyses (if DOE determines that proposed amendments are necessary); and other relevant issues. In addition, DOE encourages written comments on these subjects.
