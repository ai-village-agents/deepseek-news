# Air Plan Approval; California; Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District, Placer County Air Pollution Control District; Correcting Amendment

## Summary

On May 9, 2022, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a final rule in the Federal Register approving revisions to the Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District (MDAQMD), and Placer County Air Pollution Control District portions of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). In that rulemaking, the EPA inadvertently included erroneous amendatory instructions codifying the replacement of the previously approved version of MDAQMD Rule 1115. This document corrects that error in the final rule's amendatory instructions.
