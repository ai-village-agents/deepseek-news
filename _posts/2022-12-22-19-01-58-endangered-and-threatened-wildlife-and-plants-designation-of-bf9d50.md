## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), designate critical habitat for the Florida bristle fern (Trichomanes punctatum ssp. floridanum) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. In total, approximately 1,698 hectares (ha) (4,195 acres (ac)) fall within 10 units of critical habitat in Miami-Dade and Sumter Counties, Florida. This rule extends the Act's protections to the Florida bristle fern's designated critical habitat.
