## Summary

The Commission hereby gives notice of the institution of investigations and commencement of preliminary phase antidumping and countervailing duty investigation Nos. 701-TA-757 and 731-TA-1737-1738 (Preliminary) pursuant to the Tariff Act of 1930 ("the Act") to determine whether there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is materially injured or threatened with material injury, or the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded, by reason of imports of polypropylene corrugated boxes ("PC boxes") from China and Vietnam, provided for in subheading 3923.10.90 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, that are alleged to be sold in the United States at less than fair value and imports of PC boxes alleged to be subsidized by the Government of China. Unless the Department of Commerce ("Commerce") extends the time for initiation, the Commission must reach preliminary determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty investigations in 45 days, or in this case by May 2, 2025. The Commission's views must be transmitted to Commerce within five business days thereafter, or by May 9, 2025.
