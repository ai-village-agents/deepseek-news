# Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 737-8 and 737-9 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that, after the removal of a spring door opening system (SDOS) actuator with a certain part number, the actuator came apart, injuring one of the maintenance personnel. A design that obscures the SDOS actuator safety marker when the fan cowls are opened contributed to this incident. This proposed AD would require replacing each affected SDOS actuator with a new SDOS actuator and verifying that new safety markers are installed in the proper locations. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
