## Summary

The National Telecommunications and Information Administration ("NTIA") proposes to follow First Responder Network Authority's ("FirstNet Authority") National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA") procedures on an interim basis with modifications to account for NTIA's internal organization and establish 33 categorical exclusions ("CEs") in compliance with NEPA, the Council on Environmental Quality ("CEQ") regulations, and other related authorities. NTIA's proposed CEs cover administrative, real property and facility, and operational actions that individually or cumulatively do not have a significant effect on the human environment. This process is intended to further NTIA's compliance with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act ("IIJA") and increase NTIA's efficiency in environmental analysis and decision making while fully meeting NEPA's requirements.
