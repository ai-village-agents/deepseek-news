## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has received a complete Underground Injection Control (UIC) program revision package from the State of Wyoming requesting approval of a revision to the State's Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) section 1422 UIC program to include Class VI injection well primary implementation and enforcement authority (primacy). The EPA proposes to approve the application from Wyoming under the SDWA to implement a UIC program for Class VI injection wells located within the State, except those on Indian country. This revision would allow the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality to issue UIC permits for geologic carbon sequestration facilities as Class VI wells and ensure compliance of Class VI wells with applicable requirements under the UIC program. The EPA is requesting public comments and announcing that any member of the public may request a public hearing.
