## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2016-16- 06, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A300 B4-603, B4-605R, and B4-622R airplanes; and Model A310-304, -324, and -325 airplanes. AD 2016-16-06 required inspections around the rivet heads of the seal retainer run-out holes at certain frames and corrective actions if necessary. This AD was prompted by a report of a crack found on a certain door frame, and a determination that other frames may also be susceptible to cracking, and that additional airplanes may be affected by the unsafe condition. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2016-16-06 and adds airplanes, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
