## Summary

On May 28, 2010, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) guidance related to the "generic" clearance process. Generally, this is an expedited clearance process by which agencies may obtain OMB's approval of collection of information requests that are "usually voluntary, low- burden, and uncontroversial," do not raise any substantive or policy issues, and do not require policy or methodological review. The process requires the submission of an overarching plan that defines the scope of the individual collections that may be submitted under that umbrella. This notice is intended to advise the public of our intent to extend OMB's approval of our MACPro (Medicaid and CHIP Program) umbrella and all of the individual generic collection of information requests that fall under that umbrella. This notice also provides the public with general instructions for obtaining documents that are associated with such collections and for submitting comments.
