## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-100-1A10 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that a design deficiency was discovered which could allow a no-back pawl to be incorrectly installed in a horizontal stabilizer trim actuator (HSTA). This proposed AD would require a check for part number and serial numbers of the HSTA, and if necessary, inspection of the no-back pawl installation, and corrective action. This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
