## Summary

The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) is finalizing its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) regulations to incorporate amendments to the FOIA set forth in the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016; to conform to guidance for Federal agencies from the Department of Justice; to make them easier for the public to understand and use; and to better reflect CEQ's current policy and practice. These final regulations reaffirm CEQ's commitment to providing the fullest possible disclosure of records to the public. In addition, CEQ is amending its regulations implementing the Privacy Act of 1974 (the Privacy Act) to make them easier for the public to understand and use and to better reflect CEQ's current policy and practice. These final regulations also make administrative changes, including reorganizing, renumbering, and renaming the sections of CEQ's current FOIA and Privacy Act regulations. CEQ considered all of the public comments received on its proposed rule and made changes in response in this final rule.
