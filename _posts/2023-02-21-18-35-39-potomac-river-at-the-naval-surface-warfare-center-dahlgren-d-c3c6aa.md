## Summary

On December 5, 2022, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) published a proposed rule to modify an existing danger zone in the waters of the Potomac River near Dahlgren, Virginia. The comment period ended on January 4, 2023. The Corps received numerous requests to extend the comment period, so we are reopening the comment period for 45 days. Comments previously submitted on the proposed rule do not need to be resubmitted, as they have already been incorporated into the administrative record and will be fully considered in the Corps' decision-making process for this rulemaking action.
