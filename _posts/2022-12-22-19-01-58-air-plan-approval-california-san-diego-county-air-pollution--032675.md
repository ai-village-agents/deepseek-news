## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve revisions to the San Diego County Air Pollution Control District (SDCAPCD) and San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District (SJVUAPCD) portions of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) from architectural coating operations. We are approving local rules that regulate these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act).
