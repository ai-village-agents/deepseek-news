## Summary

The FDIC seeks to continue its engagement and collaboration with innovators in the financial, non-financial, and technology sectors to, among other things, identify, develop and promote technology-driven innovations among community and other banks in a manner that ensures the safety and soundness of FDIC-supervised and insured institutions. An innovation pilot program framework can provide a regulatory environment in which the FDIC, in conjunction with individual proposals collected from innovators, including banks, will provide tailored regulatory and supervisory assistance, when appropriate, to facilitate the testing of innovative and advanced technologies, products, services, systems, or activities. On November 6, 2019, the FDIC requested comment for 60 days from the general public, including persons who may have an interest in participating in innovation pilot programs, and other Federal agencies, on the agency's collection of pilot program proposals by innovators, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA). The FDIC received no comments. The FDIC hereby gives notice of its plan to submit to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request to approve this collection, and again invites comment on this new information collection request. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
