## Summary

The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and the Maritime Administration announce the start of the comment period and the public meeting for the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the BMOP LLC (BMOP) deepwater port license application for the export of oil from the United States to nations abroad. The BMOP application proposes the ownership, construction, operation, and eventual decommissioning of an offshore oil export deepwater port that would be located within and adjacent to the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) in West Cameron Lease Blocks (WC) 509 and 508 and East Cameron (EC) Block 263. Following the existing Stingray pipeline, the DWP will be approximately 99 statute miles off the coast of Cameron Parish, Louisiana, with an approximate water depth of 162 feet. The deepwater port would allow for loading Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) and other sized crude oil cargo carriers via a Catenary Anchor Leg Mooring (CALM).
