## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), withdraw the proposed rule to reclassify the Virgin Islands tree boa (listed as Epicrates monensis granti) from endangered to threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. This withdrawal is based on new information we received during the proposed rule's public comment periods, specifically new survey results that indicate that the Virgin Islands tree boa is likely extirpated from Cayo Ratones. We also realized an error in calculations that reduced the resiliency of the Cayo Diablo population. After evaluating the status of the species following these changes, we find that the species still meets the Act's definition of an endangered species. We have, therefore, determined that reclassification of this species is not appropriate at this time. Accordingly, we also withdraw the proposed 4(d) rule for the Virgin Islands tree boa.
