## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing three temporary safety zones for the safe splashdown and recovery of reentry vehicles launched by Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX) in support of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) missions. The temporary safety zones are located within the Coast Guard Sector Mobile area of responsibility (AOR) offshore of Panama City, Pensacola, and Tallahassee, Florida. This rule prohibits U.S.-flagged vessels from entering any of the temporary safety zones unless authorized by the Commanding Officer of Coast Guard Sector Mobile or a designated representative. Foreign-flagged vessels are encouraged to remain outside the safety zones. This action is necessary to protect vessels and waterway users from the potential hazards created by reentry vehicle splashdowns and recovery operations in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). It is also necessary to ensure the safe recovery of reentry vehicles, and any personnel involved in reentry services, after the splashdown. We received no public comments.
