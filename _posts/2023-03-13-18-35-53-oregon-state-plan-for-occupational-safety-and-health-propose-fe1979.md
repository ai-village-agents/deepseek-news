## Summary

This document gives notice of the eligibility of the Oregon State occupational safety and health plan (State Plan) for determination under Section 18(e) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 as to whether final approval of the State Plan over temporary labor camps should be granted. This notice of eligibility for an 18(e) determination applies only to coverage of temporary labor camps and does not affect or disturb the previous grant of final approval in 2005 as to all other issues covered by the Oregon State Plan. If an affirmative determination under section 18(e) is made, the Federal standard and enforcement authority will no longer apply to temporary labor camps.
