## Summary

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) proposes to direct the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), the Commission-certified Electric Reliability Organization (ERO), to develop new or modified Reliability Standards that address the following reliability gaps related to inverter-based resources (IBR): data sharing; model validation; planning and operational studies; and performance requirements. Further, the Commission proposes to direct NERC to submit to the Commission a compliance filing within 90 days of the effective date of the final rule in this proceeding that includes a detailed, comprehensive standards development and implementation plan to ensure all new or modified Reliability Standards necessary to address the IBR-related reliability gaps identified in the final rule are submitted to the Commission within 36 months of Commission approval of the plan.
