## Summary

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, invites the general public to take this opportunity to comment on an extension, with change, of a currently approved information collection. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice seeks comments concerning changes to modernize and simplify the disaster assistance registration. The changes will reduce the burden on survivors by only requiring them to answer questions based on the type of assistance they need. This will also reduce the amount of time it takes for survivors to apply either online, or through a call center, therefore allowing call center agents to assist survivors more quickly. The notice also includes FEMA documenting all post-registration contacts, including callouts, casework, and auto-dialers performed for the purpose of determining whether disaster assistance applicants have unmet needs and may be eligible for additional assistance and/or share the results of those contacts directly with external stakeholders, such as state or local government partners, who can potentially assist those same applicants with assistance or services not provided by FEMA through specific programs directly targeted to disaster survivors.
