## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) debarring Adam Michael Nagy for a period of 15 years from importing or offering for import any drug into the United States. FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Nagy was convicted of three relevant felony counts under Federal law. The factual basis supporting Mr. Nagy's conviction, as described below, is conduct relating to the importation into the United States of a drug or controlled substance. Mr. Nagy was given notice of the proposed debarment and was given an opportunity to request a hearing to show why he should not be debarred. As of October 22, 2023 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Mr. Nagy had not responded. Mr. Nagy's failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this matter.
