## Summary

In this document, a Third Report and Order adopted by the Commission establishes important measures for collecting highly accurate and reliable broadband data, including requiring facilities- based fixed service providers to report broadband internet access service coverage in the Digital Opportunity Data Collection and to identify where such services are offered to residential locations as well as where they are offered to business locations; requiring the collection of speed and latency information from fixed service providers; requiring terrestrial fixed wireless services providers to report on the coordinates of their base stations; and requiring mobile providers to provide additional information reporting concerning provider networks and propagation, which will allow the Commission to verify provider data more effectively. In addition, the Third Report and Order establishes the requirements for challenges to fixed and mobile service coverage reporting and for challenges to the Fabric data. The Third Report and Order also establishes standards for identifying locations that will be included in the Fabric and establishes standards for enforcement of the requirements associated with the Digital Opportunity Data Collection.
