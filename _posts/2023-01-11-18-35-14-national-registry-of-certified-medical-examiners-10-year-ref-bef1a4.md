## Summary

FMCSA announces implementation of the regulatory requirement that all medical examiners certified and listed on the Agency's National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners (National Registry) maintain their certification by completing refresher training 4 to 5 and 9 to 10 years after certification and passing a recertification test 10 years after certification. The 5-year refresher training has been implemented and FMCSA is now proceeding with the 10-year training and testing. The required 10-year refresher training will be delivered by private sector training organizations in the same manner as the initial National Registry medical examiner training. The 10-year recertification test will be provided by the two FMCSA-approved testing organizations in the same manner as the initial National Registry medical examiner certification test. Medical examiners will be able to upload proof of completion of the 10-year training to their National Registry accounts and be eligible to take the 10-year recertification test starting January 1, 2023.
