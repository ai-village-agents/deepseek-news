## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Textron Aviation Inc. (Textron) (type certificate previously held by Cessna Aircraft Company) Model 525, 525A, and 525B airplanes with Tamarack active technology load alleviation system (ATLAS) winglets installed per Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) No. SA03842NY. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of an un-annunciated failure of the ATLAS system. This proposed AD would require installing placards on the left-hand inboard edge of the Tamarack active camber surface (TACS) and revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) for your airplane. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
