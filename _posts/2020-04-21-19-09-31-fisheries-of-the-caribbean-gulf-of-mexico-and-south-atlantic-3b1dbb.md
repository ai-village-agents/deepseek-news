## Summary

NMFS proposes to implement management measures described in Regulatory Amendment 29 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Snapper- Grouper Fishery of the South Atlantic Region (Snapper-Grouper FMP), as prepared and submitted by the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council). If implemented, this proposed rule would require descending devices be on board vessels and require the use of specific fish hook types while fishing for or possessing snapper-grouper species. The proposed rule would also allow the use of powerheads in Federal waters off South Carolina to harvest snapper-grouper species. The purpose of this proposed rule is to modify fishing gear requirements to promote best fishing practices and to ensure consistent regulations for the dive component of the snapper-grouper fishery.
