## Summary

CISA is announcing publication of finalized security requirements for restricted transactions pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 14117, "Preventing Access to Americans' Bulk Sensitive Personal Data and United States Government-Related Data by Countries of Concern." In October 2024, CISA published proposed security requirements for restricted transactions which would apply to classes of restricted transactions identified in regulations issued by the Department of Justice (DOJ). CISA solicited comment on those proposed security requirements and considered that public feedback when developing the final security requirements. This notice also provides CISA's responses to the public comments received.
