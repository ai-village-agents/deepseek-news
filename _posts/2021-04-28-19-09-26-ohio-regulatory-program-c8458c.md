## Summary

We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), are announcing receipt of a proposed amendment to the Ohio regulatory program (Ohio program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). Ohio seeks to amend its regulatory program in order to remove the requirement that a resident agent's tax ID number or the last four digits of a resident agent's social security number must be provided in a coal mining application and to make a non-substantive administrative change to a paragraph reference. This document gives notice of the times when and locations where the Ohio program and this proposed Ohio program amendment will be available for public inspection, the comment period during which you may submit written comments on the amendment, and the procedures that we will follow for the public hearing, if one is requested.
