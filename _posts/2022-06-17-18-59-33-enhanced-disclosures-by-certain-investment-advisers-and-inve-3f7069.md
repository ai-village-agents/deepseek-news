## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") is proposing to amend rules and forms under both the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Advisers Act") and the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") to require registered investment advisers, certain advisers that are exempt from registration, registered investment companies, and business development companies, to provide additional information regarding their environmental, social, and governance ("ESG") investment practices. The proposed amendments to these forms and associated rules seek to facilitate enhanced disclosure of ESG issues to clients and shareholders. The proposed rules and form amendments are designed to create a consistent, comparable, and decision-useful regulatory framework for ESG advisory services and investment companies to inform and protect investors while facilitating further innovation in this evolving area of the asset management industry. In addition, we are proposing an amendment to Form N-CEN applicable to all Index Funds, as defined in Form N-CEN, to provide identifying information about the index.
