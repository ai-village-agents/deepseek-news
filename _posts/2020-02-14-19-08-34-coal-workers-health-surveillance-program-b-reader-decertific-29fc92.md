## Summary

HHS proposes to revise the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Coal Workers' Health Surveillance Program (Program) regulations by adding a provision to allow NIOSH to suspend or revoke B Reader certification. Certification may be revoked for any B Reader found by NIOSH to have engaged in a pattern of providing unreasonably inaccurate chest radiograph classifications in practice-- those that are found by the Program to diverge substantially from a competent interpretation of the radiographs, as determined by a panel of practicing, certified B Readers selected by NIOSH. In addition to the B Reader provisions, HHS would also amend existing regulatory text to allow compensation for pathologists who perform autopsies on coal miners at a market rate, on a discretionary basis as needed for public health purposes.
