## Summary

This notice announces EPA's final order for the amendment to terminate uses, voluntarily requested by the registrant and accepted by the Agency, of the uses listed in Table 1 of Unit II., pursuant to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). This termination order follows an August 6, 2020 Federal Register Notice of Receipt of Request from the registrant listed in Table 2 of Unit II. to voluntarily amend Chem-Tech, Ltd (Chem-Tech) dust formulations to terminate TCVP use on dogs, cats and in kennels and dog houses. In the August 6, 2020 notice, EPA indicated that it would issue an order implementing the use deletions, unless the Agency received substantive comments within the 30-day comment period that would merit its further review of these requests, or unless the registrant withdrew their request. The Agency did not receive any comments on the notice nor did the registrant withdraw their request. Accordingly, EPA hereby issues in this notice a termination order granting the requested amendments to terminate TCVP use on dogs, cats and in kennels and dog houses. Any distribution, sale, or use of the products subject to this use deletion order is permitted only in accordance with the terms of this order, including any existing stocks provisions.
