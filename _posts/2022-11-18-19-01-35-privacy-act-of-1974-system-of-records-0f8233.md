## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to modify a current DHS system of records titled, "DHS/Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-006 Citizen Corps Program System of Records" and retitle it, "DHS/FEMA- 006 Individual and Community Preparedness Division System of Records." This system of records allows DHS/FEMA to collect from and maintain records on individuals who contact the agency about their interest in preparedness and specific voluntary programs, register and participate in FEMA's Individual and Community Preparedness Division (ICPD) programs, correspond with community stakeholder organizations, and receive survey responses. DHS/FEMA is updating this System of Records Notice to (1) revise the system name, (2) modify the system location, (3) update the purpose of the system, (4) update the authority for maintenance of the system, (5) revise the category of individuals covered by the system, (6) update the category of records in the system, (7) update record source categories; (8) update record access procedures; and (9) revise and add routine uses. Additionally, this notice includes non-substantive changes to simplify the formatting and text of the previously published notice. This modified system will be included in DHS's inventory of record systems.
