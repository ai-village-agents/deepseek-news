## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs ("VA" or "Department"), with the concurrence of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), is issuing this proposed rule for Department of Veterans Affairs employees. This document supplements the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (OGE Standards) issued by OGE and is necessary because it addresses ethical issues unique to the Department of Veterans Affairs. The proposed rule requires employees to seek prior approval for outside employment with a prohibited source, with or without compensation. Prior approval would also be required for serving, with or without compensation, as an officer, director, trustee, general partner, employee, consultant, or contractor for a Veteran-centric organization. Attorneys in the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of General Counsel (OGC) would be subject to additional requirements regarding the outside practice of law.
