## Summary

The Rural Business-Cooperative Service (Agency), an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) invites applications under the Intermediary Relending Program (IRP) for fiscal year (FY) 2023, subject to availability of funding. This Notice is being issued prior to passage of a FY 2023 Appropriations Act in order to allow applicants enough time to leverage financing, prepare and submit their applications, and give the Agency time to process program applications within FY 2023. Successful applications will be selected by the Agency for funding and subsequently awarded to the extent that funding may ultimately be made available through appropriations. An announcement on the website at https://www.rd.usda.gov/newsroom/federal-funding- opportunities will identify the amount received in the appropriations. The Agency advises that all interested parties bear the financial burden of preparing and submitting an application in response to the notice whether or not funding is appropriated for this Program in FY 2023.
