## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD- 500-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by the discovery that overwing emergency exit door (OWEED) handle covers were difficult to open on some airplanes. This proposed AD would require replacing the existing OWEED handle cover brackets with newly designed OWEED handle cover brackets and the installation of a placard regarding this replacement, as specified in Transport Canada Civil Aviation (TCCA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
