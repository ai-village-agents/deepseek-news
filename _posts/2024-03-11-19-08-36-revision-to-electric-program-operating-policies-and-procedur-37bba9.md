## Summary

The Rural Utilities Service (RUS), a Rural Development (RD) agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), is issuing a final rule with request for comments. The intent of this rulemaking is to provide more flexibility for the RUS Electric Program borrowers to complete emergency repairs while maintaining the ability to receive RUS financing, to delete unnecessary and outdated requirements imposed on electric borrowers and applicants and provide flexibility in selecting construction procurement methods that better support applicant needs in awarding construction contracts. These changes will reduce agency travel costs by extending the time between the required review period for operations and maintenance reviews, reduce the number of reviews for RUS Electric Program staff, and increase customer satisfaction and service.
