## Summary

NMFS proposes to implement main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) annual catch limits (ACLs) and accountability measures (AMs) for deepwater shrimp, precious corals, and gray jobfish (uku) in 2019-2021, and for Kona crab in 2019. The proposed ACLs and AMs support the long-term sustainability of Pacific Island fisheries.
