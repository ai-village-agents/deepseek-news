## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a reported occurrence where the decorative cover to an evacuation slide detached in flight, with the slide pack found resting unsecured on the cabin floor. This AD requires accomplishing a visual inspection of the latch hook and, if necessary, corrective actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
