## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the Arizona State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) from the copper smelter in Miami, Arizona. We are proposing to approve the rescission of two Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) Arizona Administrative Code (A.A.C.) provisions from the Arizona SIP that are no longer needed to regulate this emission source under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the "Act"). We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
