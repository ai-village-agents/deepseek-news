## Summary

The City of Los Angeles, through the City of Los Angeles's Housing and Community Investment Department (HCID) is providing Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare a combined Environmental Impact Report (EIR) and Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) for the Rancho San Pedro public housing redevelopment project, located in Los Angeles, California. The proposed action is subject to NEPA because the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA), as the recipient of HUD's grant funding, proposes to carry out a Section 18/Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) demolition/disposition through a ground lease and to use a combination of Project-Based Vouchers (PBV) and Tenant Protection Vouchers (TPV). A Public Scoping Meeting for CEQA issues was held on February 6, 2021. This NOI complies with the NEPA public scoping process requirements by providing notice of a second Public Scoping Meeting on April 27, 2021 to discuss the EIR/EIS. Following the public scoping process, a Draft EIR/EIS will be prepared and ultimately circulated for public comment.
