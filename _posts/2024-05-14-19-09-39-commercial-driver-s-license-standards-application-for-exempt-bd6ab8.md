## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to renew the exemption currently held by CRST The Transportation Solution (CRST) (formerly known as CRST Expedited, Inc.) from the requirement that a commercial driver's license (CDL) holder with the proper CDL class and endorsements be seated in the front seat of the commercial motor vehicle (CMV) at all times while the commercial learner's permit (CLP) holder is engaged in behind-the-wheel training on public roads or highways. FMCSA announced its decision to provisionally renew CRST's exemption on August 7, 2023, pending a review of any comments received in response to that notice. Two comments opposing the exemption were submitted to the docket and are discussed below. The Agency believes that CRST and its drivers covered by the exemption will maintain a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level of safety that would be achieved by complying with the regulatory requirement.
