## Summary

Under the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a May 12, 2022, State Implementation Plan (SIP) submittal from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA). This SIP submittal consists of a source- specific limitation for certain process lines at Forest City Technologies, Plant 4, in Wellington, Ohio. The source-specific limitation reflects the lowest rate possible for the facility given technological and cost considerations. The source-specific limitation is established through the Ohio SIP, per the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC), and listed as an enforceable condition in the facility's operating permit, issued by OEPA on June 23, 2020.
