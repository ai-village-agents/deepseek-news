## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of the Controller is giving notice that it proposes to create a new system of records pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. MoveLINQS Relocation Software was created to assist in the processing of relocation related expenses for government employees. Originally published under EPA SORN-29, which also covers EPA travel, other accounts payable, and accounts receivable files, the EPA proposes this new SORN to transition MoveLINQS from its prior location to a separate Microsoft Azure Government Cloud. The MoveLINQS system provides the capability to allow external relocation customers (EPA employees) to enter and update their own relocation requests. In order to make payments on behalf of the requestor, certain information is collected due to IRS requirements. This information is collected via a form that is submitted by the requestor and contains the requestor's name, Social Security Number (SSN), address, email address, spouse's name, filing status (for tax purposes), and children's names and dates of birth (DOB).
