## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for certain waters of Lake Erie. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters near Cleveland, OH, during the Tall Ships Cleveland event fireworks display tri-annually in July. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Buffalo or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
