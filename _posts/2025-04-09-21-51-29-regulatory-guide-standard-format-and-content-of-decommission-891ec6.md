## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is withdrawing Regulatory Guide (RG) 3.65, "Standard Format and Content of Decommissioning Plans for Materials Licensees." This RG is being withdrawn because it is not needed to endorse NUREG-1757, "Consolidated Decommissioning Guidance: Decommissioning Process for Materials Licensees," Volume 1, "Decommissioning Process for Materials Licensees." NUREG-1757 provides the most current guidance on decommissioning nuclear facilities to support license termination for applicants, licensees, and NRC staff reviewers.
