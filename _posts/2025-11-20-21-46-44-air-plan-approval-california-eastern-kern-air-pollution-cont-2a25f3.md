## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a revision to the Eastern Kern Air Pollution Control District (EKAPCD or "District") portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). This revision concerns emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) from stationary gas turbines. We are approving a local rule that regulates these emissions sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act").
