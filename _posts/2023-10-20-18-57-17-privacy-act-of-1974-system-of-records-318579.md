## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (Privacy Act), the U.S. Department of Education (Department) publishes this notice of a new system of records titled "Connecting Adults to Success: Evaluation of Career Navigator Training" (18-13-46). This system contains personally identifiable information provided by adult learners and staff at adult education sites who participate in the Connecting Adults to Success: Evaluation of Career Navigator Training (the Study). The information in this system will be used to assess whether providing career navigators with training leads to improved education and employment outcomes among adult learners. The Study will examine whether outcomes measured at 18 and 30 months after beginning participation in the Study differ on average between learners in the Study's sites who are assigned by lottery to receive the Study's career navigator training and learners in the Study's sites who are assigned by lottery to a control group.
