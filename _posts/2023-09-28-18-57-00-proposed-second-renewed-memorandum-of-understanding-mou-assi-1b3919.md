## Summary

The FHWA and the State of Arizona, acting by and through its Department of Transportation (State), propose a second renewal of the State's participation in the State Assumption of Responsibility for Categorical Exclusions program. This program allows FHWA to assign to States its authority and responsibility for determining whether certain designated activities within the geographic boundaries of the State, as specified in the proposed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), are categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act. This MOU would renew and continue the State's participation in the program. The renewed MOU will amend the existing MOU by incorporating the following changes: Including language to reference the State's responsibility to report project impacts to environmental justice populations; clarifying that this assignment applies to any action to which a CE is applicable including non-highway projects; and adding a reference to the Final April 2020 Programmatic Agreement Pursuant to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act Regarding Implementation of Federal-Aid Transportation Projects in the State of Arizona (September 2020).
