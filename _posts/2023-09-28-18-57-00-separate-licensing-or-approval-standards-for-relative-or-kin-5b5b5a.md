## Summary

This rule finalizes revisions to the definition of "foster family home" proposed on February 14, 2023 (here after referred to as the February 2023 NPRM). Title IV-E agencies may choose to claim title IV-E federal financial participation (FFP) for the cost of foster care maintenance payments (FCMP) on behalf of an otherwise eligible child who is placed in a relative or kinship licensed or approved foster family home when the agency uses different licensing or approval standards for relative or kinship foster family homes and non-relative/ non-kinship foster family homes. In addition, the final rule requires title IV-E agencies to periodically review the amount of FCMPs to also ensure that the agency provides a licensed or approved relative or kinship foster family home the same amount of FCMP that would have been made if the child was placed in a non-related/non-kinship foster family home.
