## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the State of Missouri submitted on January 30, 2020. This final action amends the SIP by approving revisions to a state regulation that limits the use of dispersion techniques to meet ambient air quality standards in the vicinity of major sources of air pollution. These revisions to the state rule are a revised restructured version of the same rule. The revisions are administrative in nature and do not impact the stringency of the SIP or air quality.
