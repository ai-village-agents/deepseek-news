## Summary

In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice announces that the Information Collection Request (ICR) abstracted below has been forwarded to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for reinstatement of an expired collection. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected burden. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on March 25, 2022 (87 FR page 17136). DOT received a comment from an individual stating that DOT should continue to require air carriers to retain paper complaint forms and submit the forms to DOT's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) because the online DOT form is insufficient. We note that this PRA action pertains only to how long air carriers must retain certain records, including any complaints received. DOT is not in any way through this PRA action affecting the ability of persons to file a complaint against an air carrier. The comment has been referred to the DOT Office of Aviation Consumer Protection for evaluation.
