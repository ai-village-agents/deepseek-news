## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC" or "Commission") is amending its Rules of Practice and its Rules Relating to Investigations. The revised Rules of Practice enhance the transparency of the Commission's enforcement proceedings, specifying that the Commission can accept an offer of settlement by order of the Commission and establishing requirements for the form and content of recommendation memos provided by the Division of Enforcement to the Commission when recommending an offer of settlement. The revised Rules Relating to Investigations revise the applicable procedures when the Division of Enforcement notifies persons who may be named in an enforcement action, including that the notification or confirmation of the notice be in writing.
