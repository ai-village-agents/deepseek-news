## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of the Army is modifying and reissuing a current system of records notice (SORN) titled "Personnel Security Clearance Information Files," A0380-67 DAMI. The SORN is being retitled "U.S. Army Security and Foreign Disclosure Files," with a new identifier of A0 0001 DAMI. Originally established to facilitate the processing of personnel security clearance actions, the SORN also documented clearances granted or denied and confirmed eligibility for access to classified information or assignment to sensitive positions. A separate notice rescinding Army SORN A0001 DAMI, "Controlled Accountable Document Inventory System," is being published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register. This update incorporates the DoD standard routine uses and supports additional information sharing outside of the DoD. It also expands the authorities for maintaining the system, integrates records previously managed under the Controlled Accountable Document Inventory System, addresses records maintained across all general intelligence security disciplines, and expands on the purposes of such uses. Additionally, the update revises system locations and managers. These changes align the SORN with modernized automation systems and ensure compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.
