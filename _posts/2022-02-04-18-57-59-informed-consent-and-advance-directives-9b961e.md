## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) published an interim final rule amending its regulation regarding informed consent and advance directives. In that rulemaking, we amended the regulation by reorganizing it and amending language where necessary to enhance clarity. We also made changes to facilitate the informed consent process, the ability to communicate with patients or surrogates through available modalities of communication, and the execution and witness requirements for a VA Advance Directive. Before adopting that interim final rule as final, VA revises the provision related to which personnel may be delegated the responsibility for providing a patient with information needed for the patient to make a fully informed consent decision. Upon further review, VA has determined that this provision requires a further change to better clarify roles in the team-based delivery of care model. We are providing the public an opportunity to submit comments solely on this amendment.
