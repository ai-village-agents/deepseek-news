## Summary

Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), as implemented by Council on Environmental Quality regulations, the Department of the Army announces its intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) to analyze a real estate transaction and a related utilities infrastructure upgrade. The real estate transaction would alter, where necessary, an existing transmission line easement at West Point, NY, and would grant to Orange and Rockland Utilities (O&R) a new 150-foot-wide transmission line easement at West Point. These measures would allow O&R to upgrade its existing 34.5-kilovolt (kV) electrical transmission line and associated infrastructure between its Woodbury Transition Station (in the Town of Woodbury, NY), West Point, NY, and the neighboring Village of Highland Falls, NY. The EIS will evaluate the environmental impact of the Proposed Action, to include its impact on adjacent properties.
