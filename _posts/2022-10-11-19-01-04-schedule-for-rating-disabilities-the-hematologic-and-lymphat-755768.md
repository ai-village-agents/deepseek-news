## Summary

On October 29, 2018, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) published in the Federal Register a final rule that amended the portion of the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities ("VASRD" or "rating schedule") that addresses the hematologic and lymphatic systems. This correction addresses two typographical errors in the text of a 100- percent disability evaluation language under diagnostic code (DC) 7718, Essential Thrombocythemia and Primary Myelofibrosis, and Note (2) under DC 7718 in the published final rule.
