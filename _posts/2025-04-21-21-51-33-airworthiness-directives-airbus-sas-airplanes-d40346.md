# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus SAS Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A318, A319, A320, and A321 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a heavy maintenance check that found elongation on the upper section of the vertical member's assembly at the frame (FR) 24A cargo panel sub-structure. This proposed AD would require a check for certain repairs, and as applicable, repetitive detailed visual inspections of the vertical member's upper part and the upper fittings at FR 24A in the forward cargo compartment and corrective actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
