## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2025-13- 12, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. AD 2025-13-12 required replacement of any affected elevator flight control remote module (FCRM), prohibited the installation of aileron or spoiler FCRMs in place of elevator or rudder FCRMs, and limited the installation of FCRMs under certain conditions. Since the FAA issued AD 2025-13-12, the manufacturer developed a modification that eliminates the unsafe condition. This AD continues to require the actions of AD 2025-13-12. This AD also requires installation of the flight control and guidance system (FCGS) primary computer (PRIM) P14.1.3 and secondary computer (SEC) S14.1.2 software standards and prohibits installation of earlier software standards. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
