## Summary

In accordance with ORR regulations, the Director of ORR is announcing the expansion of the Refugee Cash Assistance (RCA) and Refugee Medical Assistance (RMA) eligibility period from 8 months to 12 months of assistance for participants whose date of eligibility for ORR benefits is on or after October 1, 2021. Through the Refugee Act of 1980, Congress authorized cash and medical assistance up to 36 months, yet by fiscal year (FY) 1992, mainly due to insufficient appropriations, ORR had reduced the RCA and RMA eligibility periods to 8 months. For 30 years, ORR has not increased the RCA or RMA eligibility period. Extending the RCA and RMA eligibility period will lead to more effective resettlement, by providing refugee and other ORR-eligible populations with additional time to become self- sufficient.
