## Summary

The Commission announces its disposition of a Petition for Rulemaking filed on December 4, 2018, by Extreme Reach. The Petition asks the Commission to amend its regulation on the size of letters in disclaimers in certain television advertisements such that the required letter size for advertisements broadcast in high definition would be reduced. Because changing the Commission's regulations as requested in the Petition would create a direct conflict with regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, the Commission is not initiating a rulemaking at this time.
