## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2025-03-07, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A318, A319, and A320 series airplanes, and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, - 213, -231, -232, -251N, -252N, -253N, -271N, -272N, -251NX, -252NX, - 253NX, -271NX, and -272NX airplanes. AD 2025-03-07 requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2025-03-07, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would continue to require certain actions in AD 2025-03-07 and would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, and would expand the applicability. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
