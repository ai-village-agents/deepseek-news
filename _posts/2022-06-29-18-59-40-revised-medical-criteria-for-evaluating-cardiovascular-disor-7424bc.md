## Summary

We propose to revise some of the criteria in the Listing of Impairments (listings) that we use to evaluate claims involving cardiovascular disorders in adults and children under titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act (Act). The proposed revisions reflect advances in medical knowledge, our adjudicative experience, and comments we received from experts and the public in response to an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM), and at an outreach policy conference.
