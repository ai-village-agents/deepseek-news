## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is exempting residues of the antimicrobial pesticide ingredient hypochlorous acid from the requirement of a tolerance when used on or applied to food- contact surfaces in public eating places. The EPA is finalizing this rule on its own initiative under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) to address residues identified as part of the EPA's registration review program under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).
