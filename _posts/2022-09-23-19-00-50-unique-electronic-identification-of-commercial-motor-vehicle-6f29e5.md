## Summary

FMCSA requests public comment on whether the agency should amend the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations to require every commercial motor vehicle (CMV) operating in interstate commerce to be equipped with electronic identification (ID) technology capable of wirelessly communicating a unique ID number when queried by a Federal or State motor carrier safety enforcement personnel. In response to a petition for rulemaking from the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA), FMCSA is considering such amendments to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the roadside inspection program by more fully enabling enforcement agencies to focus their efforts at high-risk carriers and drivers.
