## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the revocation of three Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) (the Authorizations) issued to OraSure Technologies, Inc. (OraSure) for the OraQuick Ebola Rapid Antigen Test used with whole blood specimens; OraSure for the OraQuick Ebola Rapid Antigen Test used with cadaveric oral fluid swab specimens; and DiaSorin Inc. (DiaSorin) for the LIAISON XL Zika Capture IgM II assay. FDA revoked both of OraSure's Authorizations on October 10, 2019, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), in consideration of a De Novo classification request granted to OraSure for the OraQuick Ebola Rapid Antigen Test on October 10, 2019. FDA revoked DiaSorin's Authorization on October 28, 2019, under the FD&C Act, in consideration of the premarket clearance of DiaSorin's LIAISON XL Zika Capture IgM II assay, which FDA determined to be substantially equivalent to a legally marketed class II predicate device on October 28, 2019. The revocations, which include an explanation of the reasons for each revocation, are reprinted in this document.
