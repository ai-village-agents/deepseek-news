## Summary

This notice establishes a revised user fee for federal agencies requesting name-based, non-criminal justice background checks of the FBI's Central Records System through the Enterprise Vetting Center (EVC), formally known as the National Name Check Program (NNCP). The total resource costs associated with providing name check services have been calculated to ensure full reimbursement to the FBI ("cost reimbursement portion" of the fee). The FBI is also authorized to charge an additional amount to defray costs required to update and improve the EVC's technological infrastructure, which supports the automation of processes involving name-based background checks ("automation portion" of the fee). This notice explains the methodology used to calculate revised fees and also provides the updated fee schedule. In addition, and in conjunction with the revised fee for the name-based checks, this notice also establishes an interim monthly fee for Continuous Vetting (CV) checks.
