## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce 90- day findings on eight petitions to add species to the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants and one petition to revise critical habitat for a listed species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Based on our review, we find that the petitions to list the cinnamon juga (Juga canella), Great Basin ramshorn (Helisoma newberryi), montane peaclam (Pisidium ultramontanum), painted woolly bat (Kerivoula picta), Southern Cascades population of the Sierra Nevada red fox (Vulpes vulpes necator), and Sulawesi forest turtle (Leucocephalon yuwonoi) present substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned actions may be warranted. Therefore, with the publication of this document, we announce that we are initiating status reviews of these species to determine whether the petitioned actions are warranted. To ensure that the status reviews are comprehensive, we request scientific and commercial data and other information regarding the species and factors that may affect their status. Based on the status reviews, we will issue 12-month petition findings, which will address whether or not the petitioned actions are warranted, in accordance with the Act. We also find that the petition to revise critical habitat for the leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) presents substantial scientific information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted. Therefore, we announce that we plan to determine how we will proceed with the request to revise a critical habitat designation for the species. We further find that the petitions to list the Alaskan glacier buttercup (Ranunculus glacialis subsp. alaskensis) and eastern population of the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) do not present substantial scientific or commercial information indicating the petitioned actions may be warranted. Therefore, we are not initiating a status review of the Alaskan glacier buttercup or the eastern population of golden eagle.
