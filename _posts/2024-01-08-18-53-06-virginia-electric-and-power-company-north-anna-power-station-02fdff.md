## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing for public comment a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS), published as NUREG-1437, Supplement 7a, Second Renewal, "Site-Specific Environmental Impact Statement for License Renewal of Nuclear Plants Regarding Subsequent License Renewal for North Anna Power Station Units 1 and 2, Draft Report for Comment." This DEIS supersedes NUREG-1437, Supplement 7, Second Renewal, "Generic Environmental Impact Statement for License Renewal of Nuclear Plants, Supplement 7, Second Renewal, Regarding Subsequent License Renewal for North Anna Power Station Units 1 and 2, Draft Report for Comment," published in August 2021. North Anna Power Station Units 1 and 2 (North Anna) are located in Louisa County, Virginia. Possible alternatives to the proposed action of subsequent license renewal for North Anna include the no-action alternative and reasonable replacement power alternatives. A new notice of opportunity to request a hearing and petition for leave to intervene--limited to contentions based on new information in the DEIS--is also being issued.
