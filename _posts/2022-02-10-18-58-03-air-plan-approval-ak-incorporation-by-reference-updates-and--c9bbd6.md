## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving revisions to the Alaska State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted on November 10, 2020. The revisions update the adoption by reference of certain Federal air regulations and add a pre-approved emission limit option that may be used to permit diesel engine facilities, among other changes. The EPA's approval makes the revisions federally enforceable as part of the Alaska SIP.
