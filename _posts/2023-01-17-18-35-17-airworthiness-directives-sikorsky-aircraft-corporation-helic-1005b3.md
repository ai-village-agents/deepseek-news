## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-02-01, which applies to Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation Model S-92A helicopters with certain part-numbered main rotor stationary swashplate assemblies (swashplate assemblies) that have accumulated 1,600 or more total hours time-in-service (TIS) installed. AD 2022-02-01 requires visually inspecting the swashplate assembly at specified intervals and depending on the results, removing the swashplate assembly from service. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-02-01, the FAA determined it was necessary to expand the applicability and require more detailed inspections to address the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would retain the actions of AD 2022-02-01, expand the applicability, add a detailed recurring visual inspection, and require either eddy current inspections (ECI) or fluorescent penetrant inspections (FPI). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
