## Summary

The Office of Population Affairs (OPA), in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, proposes to revise the rules issued on March 4, 2019, establishing standards for compliance by family planning services projects authorized by Title X of the Public Health Service Act. Those rules have undermined the public health of the population the program is meant to serve. The Department proposes to revise the 2019 rules by readopting the 2000 regulations, with several modifications needed to strengthen the program and ensure access to equitable, affordable, client-centered, quality family planning services for all clients, especially for low-income clients.
