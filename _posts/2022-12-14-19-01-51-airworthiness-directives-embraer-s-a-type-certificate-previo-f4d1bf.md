## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Embraer S.A. Model ERJ 190-300 and -400 airplanes. This AD was prompted by the identification of a quality escape in the installation of certain fasteners of the lower beam (frame) splices of the overwing emergency exit (OWE) doors. This AD requires inspection, rework, if applicable, and replacement of the splice fasteners of the right-hand (RH) and left-hand (LH) OWE doors, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
