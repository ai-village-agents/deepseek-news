## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A330-223, -223F, -243, -243F, -321, -322, - 323, -341, -342, and -343 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reported occurrences of thrust fluctuation during descent with autothrottle (ATHR) active. This AD requires modifying the pin programming of the flight management guidance envelope computers (FMGECs) to activate the ATHR N1 function. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
