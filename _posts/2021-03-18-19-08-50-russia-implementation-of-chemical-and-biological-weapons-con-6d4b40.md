## Summary

The Secretary of State, acting under authority delegated pursuant to Executive Order 12851, has determined pursuant to the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991 (CBW Act) that the Government of the Russian Federation has used chemical or biological weapons in violation of international law or lethal chemical or biological weapons against its own nationals. The sanctions imposed on Russia in connection with this determination include a prohibition, subject to partial waiver, on the export to Russia of national security-controlled goods and technology subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Pursuant to the EAR, BIS already maintains controls on exports and reexports to Russia of national security-controlled "items" (commodities, software and technology) that are subject to the EAR. This document informs the public that, consistent with BIS's implementation of the CBW Act sanctions, certain license exceptions will be suspended for use with national security-controlled items destined for Russia, and most license applications for exports or reexports of national security- controlled items destined for Russia will be reviewed under a presumption of denial.
