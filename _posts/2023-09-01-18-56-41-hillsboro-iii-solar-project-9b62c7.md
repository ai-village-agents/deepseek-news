## Summary

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) intends to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the purchase of electricity generated by the proposed Hillsboro III Solar Project in Lawrence County, Alabama. The EIS will assess the potential environmental effects of constructing, operating, and maintaining the proposed 200- megawatt (MW) alternating current (AC) solar facility. The proposed 200 MW AC solar facility would occupy approximately 1,500 acres of the 3,761-acre Project Study Area. Public comments are invited concerning the scope of the EIS, alternatives being considered, and environmental issues that should be addressed as a part of this EIS. TVA is also requesting data, information, and analysis relevant to the proposed action from the public; affected federal, state, tribal, and local governments, agencies, and offices; the scientific community; industry; or any other interested party.
