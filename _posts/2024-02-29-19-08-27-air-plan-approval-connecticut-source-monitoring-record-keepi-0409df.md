## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Connecticut addressing source monitoring in Connecticut. The principal proposed revision is replacement of Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies (RCSA) section 22a-174-4 (source monitoring, record keeping and reporting), which is currently in the Connecticut SIP, with a new regulation section 22a-174-4a, also called "source monitoring, record keeping and reporting." The source monitoring SIP revision provides monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements to ensure that certain sources comply with applicable emissions limitations. This action is being taken under the Clean Air Act.
