## Summary

In this action, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing revisions to the preconstruction permitting regulations that apply to modifications at existing major stationary sources in the New Source Review (NSR) program under the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act). The proposed revisions include revising the definition of "project" in the NSR regulations, adding additional recordkeeping and reporting requirements applicable to minor modifications at existing major stationary sources, and proposing to require that decreases accounted for in the Step 1 significant emissions increase calculation be enforceable.
