## Summary

FMCSA is proposing to revise the regulatory guidance concerning recording time operating a commercial motor vehicle as a "yard move." This guidance applies to all commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers required to record their hours of service. The Agency requests public comments on the proposed guidance, which includes examples of properties that are and are not "yards." Movements of CMVs in "yards" would be considered "yard moves" and could be recorded as on-duty not driving time rather than driving time.
