## Summary

Pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), and after consultation with the General Services Administration, the Chairman of the FDIC has determined that renewal of the FDIC Advisory Committee on Community Banking (Committee) is in the public interest in connection with the performance of duties imposed upon the FDIC by law. The Committee has been a successful undertaking by the FDIC and has provided valuable feedback to the agency on a broad range of policy issues that have a particular impact on community banks throughout the United States and the local communities that are served by community banks. The Committee will continue to review various issues that may include, but not be limited to, examination policies and procedures, credit and lending practices, deposit insurance assessments, insurance coverage, and regulatory compliance matters to promote the continued growth and ability of community banks to extend financial services in their respective local markets. The structure and responsibilities of the Committee are unchanged from when it was originally established in July 2009. The Committee will continue to operate in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.
