## Summary

On June 30, 2022, the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation revised the Area Risk Protection Insurance (ARPI) Regulations, Common Crop Insurance Policy (CCIP) Basic Provisions, and 20 Crop Provisions. That final rule contained some incorrect references, missing words, grammatical and spelling errors, repetitive parenthetical titles, and inadvertently removed text in the amendatory instructions. This document makes the corrections.
