## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-10- 17, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A330-200; A330-200 Freighter; and A330-300 series airplanes. AD 2017-10-17 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new fuel airworthiness limitations. This AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive fuel airworthiness limitations and tasks are necessary. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2017-10-17 and requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate additional new or more restrictive fuel airworthiness limitations and tasks, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also expands the applicability to include additional airplane models. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
