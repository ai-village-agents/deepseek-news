## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) have determined that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on certain new pneumatic off-the-road tires (off-road tires) from India would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping, net countervailable subsidies, and material injury to an industry in the United States. Therefore, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation of these AD and CVD orders.
