## Summary

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC or Commission) is proposing to amend its existing regulations by which state and local government employees who were previously exempt from coverage under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 may bring claims of employment discrimination pursuant to the Government Employee Rights Act of 1991. The EEOC proposes to amend the regulations to explicitly provide for digital transmission of documents, to update the regulation based upon the text of other regulations or statutes, and to make a number of editorial revisions to improve clarity and correct errors.
