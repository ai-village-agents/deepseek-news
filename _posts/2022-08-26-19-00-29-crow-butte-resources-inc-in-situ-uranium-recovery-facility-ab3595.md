## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing for public comment a draft finding of no significant impact (FONSI) and accompanying draft supplement to the NRC staff's environmental assessment (EA) for the license renewal of the Crow Butte Resources, Inc. (CBR) in situ uranium recovery (ISR) facility located in Dawes County, Nebraska. Based on the analysis in the draft EA Supplement, the NRC staff has preliminarily concluded that there will be no significant impacts to cultural resources from the renewal of CBR's license and, therefore, a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) remains appropriate.
