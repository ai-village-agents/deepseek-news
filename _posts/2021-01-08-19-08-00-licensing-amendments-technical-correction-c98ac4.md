## Summary

On December 11, 2020, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) published in the Federal Register a final rule that revises its regulations relating to policies and procedures for corporate activities and transactions involving national banks and Federal savings associations to update and clarify the policies and procedures, eliminate unnecessary requirements consistent with safety and soundness, and make other technical and conforming changes. This correcting amendment supplements the Effective Date discussion in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section of the final rule as it appeared in the Federal Register. It also makes three technical changes to the regulatory text of the final rule that appeared in the Federal Register to correct typographical errors.
