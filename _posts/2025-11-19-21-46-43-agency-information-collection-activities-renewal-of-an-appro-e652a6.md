## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FMCSA announces its plan to submit the Information Collection Request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval. FMCSA requests approval to renew an ICR titled, "Motor Carrier Identification Report," which is used to identify FMCSA regulated entities, help prioritize the agency's activities, aid in assessing the safety outcomes of those activities, and for statistical purposes. This ICR is necessary to ensure regulated entities are registered with the DOT. On June 17, 2025, FMCSA published a 60-day notice in the Federal Register announcing its intention to submit this ICR to OMB for renewal. FMCSA received no comments in response to this notice.
