## Summary

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to amend its wine labeling and advertising regulations to remove an existing regulatory prohibition against statements which indicate that a wine contains distilled spirits. This proposed deregulatory action will allow wine makers and importers to provide additional information to consumers about their wines, while still providing consumers with adequate and non-misleading information as to the identity and quality of the products they purchase.
