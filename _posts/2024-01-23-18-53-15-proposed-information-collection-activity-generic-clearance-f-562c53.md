## Summary

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) proposes to extend approval of the existing overarching generic clearance for Financial Reports used for ACF Mandatory Grant Programs (OMB #0970- 0510) as well as all information collections currently approved under the overarching generic. There are no changes to the proposed types of information collection or uses of data as described in the overarching generic, and there are no changes proposed to currently approved information collections for which we are requesting an extension. Burden estimates for the next 3 years have been adjusted based on use to date.
