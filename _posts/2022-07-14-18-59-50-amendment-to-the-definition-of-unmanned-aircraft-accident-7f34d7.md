# Amendment to the Definition of Unmanned Aircraft Accident

## Summary

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is issuing a final rule, amending the definition of "Unmanned aircraft accident" by removing the weight-based requirement and replacing it with an airworthiness certificate requirement. The weight threshold is no longer an appropriate criterion because unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) under 300 lbs. are operating in high-risk environments, such as beyond line-of-sight and over populated areas. The amended definition will allow the NTSB to be notified of and quickly respond to UAS events with safety significance. Since the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), the agency considered comments and as a result eliminated the "airworthiness approval," while keeping "airworthiness certification."
