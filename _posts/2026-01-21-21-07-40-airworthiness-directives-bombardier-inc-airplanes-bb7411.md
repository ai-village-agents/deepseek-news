## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-100-1A10 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that some parts of horizontal stabilizer trim actuators (HSTAs) that were meant to be replaced through a required overhaul were not replaced and were instead reinstalled on the HSTAs. This AD requires verification of the HSTA serial number, and, if applicable, replacement of the HSTA. This AD also prohibits the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
