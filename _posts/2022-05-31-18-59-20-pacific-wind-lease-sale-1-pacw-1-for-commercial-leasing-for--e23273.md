## Summary

This document is the proposed sale notice (PSN) for the sale of commercial wind energy leases on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) in the Humboldt Wind Energy Area (WEA) and Morro Bay WEA offshore California. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) proposes to offer multiple lease areas (Lease Areas) for sale in each WEA and to conduct simultaneous auctions for Lease Areas within each WEA using a multiple-factor bidding auction format. The PSN contains information pertaining to the areas available for leasing, certain provisions and conditions of the lease, auction details, lease forms, criteria for evaluating competing bids, award procedures, appeal procedures, and lease execution procedures. The issuance of any lease resulting from this sale would not constitute approval of project-specific plans to develop offshore wind energy. Such plans, if submitted by the Lessee, would be subject to subsequent environmental, technical, and public reviews prior to a BOEM decision on whether the proposed development should be authorized.
