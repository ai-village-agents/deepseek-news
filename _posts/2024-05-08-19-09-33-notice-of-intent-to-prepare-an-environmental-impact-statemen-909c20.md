## Summary

The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Utah State Office announces its intent to prepare an EIS for the Pleasant Creek watershed in Sanpete County, Utah. The proposed EIS will examine alternative solutions to address watershed structure rehabilitation, flood damage prevention and reduction, agricultural water management, water conservation, and public recreational efforts in Mt. Pleasant City and portions of unincorporated Sanpete County. The Pleasant Creek watershed includes Mt. Pleasant City; existing water resource facilities, including the Upper Debris Basin, Lower Debris Basin, the Surge Pond, and the Agricultural Reservoir; private agricultural land; and U.S. Forest Service-managed land in the upper watershed. NRCS is requesting comments to identify significant issues, potential alternatives, information, and analyses relevant to the proposed action from all interested individuals, Federal and State agencies, and Tribes.
