## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC, Commission, or Agency) proposes to modify an existing system of records, FCC/CGB-1, Informal Complaints, Inquiries, and Requests for Dispute Assistance, subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. This action is necessary to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act to publish in the Federal Register notice of the existence and character of records maintained by the agency. The Commission uses records in this system to handle and process informal complaints, inquiries, and requests for dispute assistance received from individuals, groups, and other entities. This modification makes various necessary changes and updates to accommodate new uses of the system to collect and maintain voluntarily provided demographic data and to publicly disclose anonymized or de-identified complaint data.
