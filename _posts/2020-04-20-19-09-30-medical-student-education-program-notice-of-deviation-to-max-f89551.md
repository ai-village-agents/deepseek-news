## Summary

HRSA is requesting a deviation from competition requirements in order to fund additional applications received in fiscal year 2019 under HRSA-19-101, Medical Student Education (MSE) Program, and to fund supplements to current award recipients. In fiscal year 2020, Congress provided $50,000,000 to fund the MSE program. The report language accompanying the appropriation directed HRSA to provide up to $35,000,000 to fund additional applications received from the MSE program in fiscal year 2019. Of the remaining amount, HRSA was directed to make supplementary grant awards to entities funded in fiscal year 2019. HRSA proposes to fund each of the five unfunded applicants $7,000,000 over the four-year project period (July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2024), and to provide $2,827,679 in upfront one year supplements to each of the five currently funded programs.
