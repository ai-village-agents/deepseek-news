## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-21- 17, which applied to all The Boeing Company Model 757 airplanes. AD 2020-21-17 required repetitive inspections for skin cracking and shim migration at the upper link drag fittings, diagonal brace cracking, and fastener looseness; and applicable on-condition actions. This AD was prompted by reports of bolt rotation in the engine drag fitting joint and fastener heads and cracks found in the skin of the fastener holes, and the need to reduce the compliance time for certain groups. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2020-21-17 with reduced compliance times for certain airplane groups. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
