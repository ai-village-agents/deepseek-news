## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve several revisions to the New York State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the purposes of implementing control of air pollution by particulate matter (PM) and oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>). The proposed SIP revisions consist of amendments to several existing regulations outlined within New York's Codes, Rules, and Regulations (NYCRR) that implement control measures for PM and NO<INF>X</INF>. The intended effect of this action is to approve control strategies, required by the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), which will result in emission reductions that will help attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards for ozone and PM. These actions are being taken in accordance with the requirements of the CAA.
