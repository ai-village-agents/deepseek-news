## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Baykar Piaggio Aerospace S.p.A. (type certificate previously held by Piaggio Aviation S.p.A.) (Piaggio) Model P-180 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of leakage from the flexible hydraulic hoses connected to the hydraulic pump package (HPP). This AD requires replacing the affected flexible hydraulic hoses. This AD also prohibits installing the affected flexible hydraulic hoses on any airplane. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
