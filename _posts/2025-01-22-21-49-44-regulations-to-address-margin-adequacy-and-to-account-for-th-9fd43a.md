## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission or CFTC) is amending its regulations, adopted under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), to require a futures commission merchant (FCM) to ensure a customer does not withdraw funds from its account with the FCM if the balance in the account after the withdrawal would be insufficient to meet the customer's initial margin requirements; and relatedly, to permit an FCM, subject to certain requirements, to treat the separate accounts of a single customer as accounts of separate entities for purposes of certain Commission regulations.
