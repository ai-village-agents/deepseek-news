## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) seeks comment on additional measures to strengthen its caller ID authentication framework and further stem the tide of illegally spoofed calls. Specifically, this document seeks comment on the use of third-party caller ID authentication solutions, including whether any changes should be made to the Commission's rules to permit, prohibit, or limit their use. It also seeks comment on whether to eliminate the STIR/SHAKEN implementation extension for providers that cannot obtain Service Provider Code (SPC) tokens, which are necessary to participate in the STIR/SHAKEN caller ID authentication framework.
