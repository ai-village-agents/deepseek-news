## Summary

On February 13, 2020, we published in the Federal Register a notice inviting applications (NIA) for new awards for fiscal year (FY) 2020 for Personnel Development to Improve Services and Results for Children with Disabilities--Leadership Development Programs: Increasing the Capacity of Leaders to Improve Systems Serving Children with Disabilities, Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) number 84.325L. The NIA published with the incorrect estimated available funds, which should be $3,000,000 instead of $1,600,000. We are also correcting the estimated number of awards, which will update the estimated number of awards from 8 to 15.
