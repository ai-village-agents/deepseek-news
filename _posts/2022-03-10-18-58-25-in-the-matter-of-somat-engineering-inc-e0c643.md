## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing a Confirmatory Order to Somat Engineering, Inc. (Somat) to document commitments made as part of a settlement agreement made between the NRC and Somat following an alternative dispute resolution mediation session held on January 11, 2022. The mediation addressed three apparent violations involving Somat's failure to secure portable moisture density gauges against loss or unauthorized access or removal. Somat has committed to various measures intended to improve its ability to track such gauges, to improve employee awareness of their responsibilities to secure such gauges against loss or unauthorized access, and to share their lessons learned with others in the industry. The Confirmatory Order is effective upon issuance.
