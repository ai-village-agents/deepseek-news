## Summary

As a result of the determinations by the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that revocation of the countervailing duty (CVD) order on carbon and alloy steel wire rod (wire rod) from Italy would likely lead to the continuation or recurrence of countervailable subsidies, and material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation of this CVD order.
