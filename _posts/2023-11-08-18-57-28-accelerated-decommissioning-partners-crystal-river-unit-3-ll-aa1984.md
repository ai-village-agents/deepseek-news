## Summary

On December 12, 2022, as supplemented on June 9, 2023, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) received from Accelerated Decommissioning Partners Crystal River Unit 3, LLC (ADP CR3, licensee) a license amendment request to add a license condition to include the requirements of a License Termination Plan (LTP) for the Crystal River Unit 3 Nuclear Generating Plant (CR3). The LTP provides details about the known radiological information for the site, the planned demolition and decommissioning tasks to be completed, and the final radiological surveys and data that must be obtained for termination of the NRC's license for CR3. The NRC is requesting public comments on CR3's LTP and will hold a public meeting to discuss the LTP.
