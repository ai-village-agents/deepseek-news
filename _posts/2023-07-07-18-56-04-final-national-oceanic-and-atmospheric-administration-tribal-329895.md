## Summary

On January 26, 2021, the White House issued a Presidential Memorandum on Tribal Consultation and Strengthening Nation-to-Nation Relationships that reaffirmed the Executive order on Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments (2000). In response, NOAA sought review and comment on its Tribal consultation policy and procedures in November 2021. NOAA revised its Consultation Handbook describing procedures for government-to-government consultation with federally recognized Indian tribes, and updated an associated NOAA Administrative Order (NAO 218-8) and the Indigenous Knowledge (IK) guidance.
