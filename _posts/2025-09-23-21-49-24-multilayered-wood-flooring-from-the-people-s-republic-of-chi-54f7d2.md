## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) published a notice in the Federal Register of September 15, 2025, in which Commerce notified the public that the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT)'s final judgment in Evolutions Flooring, Inc. et al. v. United States, Consol. Court no. 21-00591 sustained Commerce's remand results pertaining to the administrative review of the countervailing duty order on multilayered wood flooring from the People's Republic of China covering the period January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2018, and is not in harmony with Commerce's final results of the administrative review. This notice notified the public that Commerce is amending the final results with respect to certain companies; however, we incorrectly spelled the name of Dalian Shengyu Science and Technology Development Co., Ltd., the producer/exporter without a superseding cash deposit rate and for which Commerce is revising its cash deposit instruction, within the Federal Register Notice.
