## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) announces that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved, for a period of three years, an information collection associated with the Commission's 2021 Inmate Calling Services (ICS) Order, FCC 21-60, in which the Commission, among other actions, expanded its consumer disclosure requirements and added new requirements for providers of calling services for incarcerated people (calling services) that seek waiver of the Commission's interstate and international rate caps. The Commission also required that calling services providers separately disclose, in connection with international calling services rates, the rate component for terminating calls to each country where that provider terminates international calls. This document is consistent with the 2021 ICS Order, which stated that the Commission would publish a document in the Federal Register announcing the effective date of these rules.
