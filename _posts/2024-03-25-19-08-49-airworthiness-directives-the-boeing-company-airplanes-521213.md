## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 777 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that the nitrogen enriched air distribution system (NEADS) cover plate assembly attached to a certain vent stringer in the center wing tank was installed without a designed electrical bond. This proposed AD would require installing electrical bonding and grounding, installing the cover plate assembly with new fasteners, and revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new airworthiness limitations. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
