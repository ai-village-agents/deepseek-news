## Summary

This rule implements changes to the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) as required by the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (the 2018 Farm Bill). The rule makes buy-up coverage levels available for 2019 and future years, increases service fees, and extends the service fee waiver and premium reduction to eligible veterans. The rule includes the changes to the payment limitation and native sod provisions and clarifies when NAP coverage is available for crops when certain crop insurance is available under the Federal Crop Insurance Act. This rule is adding provisions for eligibility and program requirements for new producers or producers with less than 1- year growing experience with a new crop (for example, most hemp producers). This rule also makes some additional minor changes to clarify existing NAP requirements and improve program integrity.
