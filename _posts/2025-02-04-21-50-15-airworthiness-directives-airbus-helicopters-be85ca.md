## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model AS332L, AS332L1, AS 365 N3, SA-365C1, SA- 365C2, SA-365N, and SA-365N1 helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report that certain rescue hoist cable assemblies may be equipped with a defective ball end. This AD requires inspecting certain rescue hoist cable assemblies and, depending on the results, replacing the rescue hoist cable assembly. This AD also allows installing certain rescue hoist cable assemblies and certain rescue hoists provided its requirements are met. These actions are specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
