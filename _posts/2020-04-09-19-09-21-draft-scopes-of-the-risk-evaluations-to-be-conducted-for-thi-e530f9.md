## Summary

As required by the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), which was amended by the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act in June 2016, EPA is announcing the availability of the draft scope documents for the risk evaluations to be conducted for 13 of 20 High-Priority Substances designated in December 2019. The draft scope document for each chemical substance includes the conditions of use, hazards, exposures, and the potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations the EPA plans to consider in conducting the risk evaluation for that chemical substance. EPA is also opening a 45- calendar day comment period on these draft scope documents to allow for the public to provide additional data or information that could be useful to the Agency in finalizing the scope of the risk evaluations; comments may be submitted to this docket and the individual dockets for each of the chemical substances.
