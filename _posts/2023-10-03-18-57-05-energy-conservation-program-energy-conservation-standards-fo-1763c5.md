# Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Metal Halide Lamp Fixtures

## Summary

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended ("EPCA"), prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment, including metal halide lamp fixtures ("MHLFs"). EPCA also requires the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") to periodically determine whether more-stringent, amended standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would result in significant energy savings. In this notification of proposed determination ("NOPD"), DOE has initially determined that amended energy conservation standards for MHLFs would not be cost effective. DOE requests comment on this proposed determination and the associated analyses and results.
