## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, announce the availability of a draft environmental assessment under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for an incidental take permit (ITP) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), supported by a draft habitat conservation plan (draft HCP). IP Aramis, LLC (applicant) has applied for an ITP under the ESA for the Aramis Solar Energy Generation and Storage Project in Alameda County, California. The requested ITP, which would be in effect for a period of 32 years, if granted, would authorize incidental take of the federally threatened California red-legged frog, federally threatened Central Distinct Population Segment of the California tiger salamander (Central California tiger salamander), federally endangered San Joaquin kit fox, Federal candidate monarch butterfly, and non-listed golden eagle, which is protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (Eagle Act). We invite the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies to comment on the application. Before issuing the requested permit, we will take into consideration any information that we receive during the public comment period.
