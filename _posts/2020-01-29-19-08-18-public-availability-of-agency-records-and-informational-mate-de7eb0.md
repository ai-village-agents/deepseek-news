## Summary

GSA is amending the General Services Administration's regulations implementing the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The regulations are being updated to incorporate changes brought about by the amendments to FOIA under both statutory and nonstatutory authorities. Specifically, this rule amends GSA's regulations under FOIA to incorporate certain changes made to FOIA by the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016. Additionally, the regulations are being updated to reflect developments in case law, recent guidance from the Department of Justice--Office of Information Policy for processing FOIA requests, technological advancements in how the FOIA is administered, and to update the cost figures used in calculating and charging search/ or review fees. Finally, the revisions to the rule increase the amount of information that members of the public may receive from the agency without being charged processing fees through proactive agency disclosures.
