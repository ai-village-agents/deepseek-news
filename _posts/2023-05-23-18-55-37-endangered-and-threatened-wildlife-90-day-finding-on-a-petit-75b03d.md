## Summary

We (NMFS) announce a positive 90-day finding on a petition to list the smalltail shark (Carcharhinus porosus) as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The petitioner also requests that we designate critical habitat. We find that the petition and information readily available in our files present substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that listing the smalltail shark as threatened or endangered may be warranted. Therefore, we are commencing a review of the status of the smalltail shark to determine whether listing under the ESA is warranted. To support a comprehensive status review, we are soliciting scientific and commercial data regarding this species.
