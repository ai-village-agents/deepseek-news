# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus SAS Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by stress analysis results indicating that cracks may appear in the center wing box at frame 42 and slanted junction areas. This proposed AD would require a one-time inspection of the center wing box at frame 42 and slanted junction areas, and applicable corrective actions, if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
