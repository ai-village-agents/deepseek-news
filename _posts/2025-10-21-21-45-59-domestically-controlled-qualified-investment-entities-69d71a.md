**Published:** February 04, 2026 21:45 UTC
**Source:** Federal Register
**Original Published:** October 21, 2025 00:00 UTC
**Document Number:** 2025-19625

## Summary

This document contains proposed regulations that would modify existing regulations on the determination of whether a qualified investment entity is domestically controlled by removing a rule that looks to the shareholders of certain domestic corporations in determining whether foreign persons hold directly or indirectly stock in a qualified investment entity. The proposed regulations would primarily affect foreign persons that own stock in a qualified investment entity that would be a United States real property interest if the qualified investment entity were not domestically controlled.
