# Thiabendazole; Pesticide Tolerances; Technical Correction

## Summary

EPA issued a final rule in the Federal Register of August 30, 2021, establishing tolerances for residues of thiabendazole in or on multiple commodities requested by the Interregional Research Project Number 4 (IR-4) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). That document inadvertently instructed the Federal Register to remove four tolerances that should have been revised and to delete two footnotes concerning other tolerances. This document corrects the final regulation. As a housekeeping measure, it also removes two tolerances that expired in 2017.
