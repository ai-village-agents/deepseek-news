## Summary

The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT or Department) is amending its Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) and Airport Concession Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (ACDBE) program regulations. The DBE and ACDBE programs are designed to allow small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals to compete fairly for DOT funded contracts let by State and local transportation agencies and in airport concession opportunities. The final rule improves program implementation in major areas, including by updating the personal net worth and program size thresholds for inflation; modernizing rules for counting of material suppliers; incorporating procedural flexibilities enacted during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic; adding elements to foster greater usage of DBEs and ACDBEs with concurrent, proactive monitoring and oversight; updating certification provisions with less prescriptive rules that give certifiers flexibility when determining eligibility; revising the interstate certification process to provide for reciprocity among certifiers; and making technical corrections to commonly misinterpreted rules.
