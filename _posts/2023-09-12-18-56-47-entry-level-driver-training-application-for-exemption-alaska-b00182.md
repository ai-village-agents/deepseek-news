## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to deny the application from Alaska's Ice Road Driving School requesting an exemption from certain portions of the behind-the-wheel (BTW) entry-level driver training (ELDT) requirements for driver trainees. The applicant explained that because of the unique road system and challenging terrain in Alaska, it is difficult to adhere to the driver training regulations, and further explained that the road configurations lead to only a few major established safe road systems in Alaska. The applicant believes that the road skills test for a Commercial Driver's License (CDL) applicant can safely be administered by the State test examiner because set routes can be established and approved without the CDL applicant completing certain portions of the mandatory BTW training. FMCSA analyzed the application and determined that the exemption would not likely achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent such exemption.
