## Summary

On June 6, 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) published its notice of initiation and preliminary results of a changed circumstances review (CCR) of the antidumping duty (AD) order on finished carbon steel flanges (flanges) from India. For these final results, Commerce finds that BFN Forgings Private Limited (BFN) is the successor-in-interest to Bebitz Flanges Works Private Limited (Bebitz) and should be assigned the same AD cash deposit rate for purposes of determining AD liability.
