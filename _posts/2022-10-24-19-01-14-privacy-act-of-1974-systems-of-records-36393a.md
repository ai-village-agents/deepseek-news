## Summary

Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974 and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-108, to ensure the system of records notices remain accurate, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff reviews each notice on a periodic basis. As a result of this systematic review, the NRC is republishing 13 of its system of records notices and has made various revisions to ensure that the NRC's notices remain clear, accurate, and up to date. Four of the system notices--NRC 5, Grants Management System, NRC 8, Employee Disciplinary Actions, Appeals, Grievances, and Complaints Records, NRC 11, Reasonable Accommodations Records, and NRC 23, Case Management System--Indices, Files, and Associated Records are subject to a 30-day comment period. The revisions to these systems, with the exception of the modifications to routines uses for the NRC 5 and NRC 8 systems, are in effect upon this publication. The NRC 5 and NRC 8 routine use modifications will go into effect 30 days after this publication. The remaining systems revisions are minor corrective and administrative changes that do not meet the threshold criteria established by OMB for either a new or altered system of records. The minor modifications include updating authorities, narrowing the scope of one system notice, renaming two systems for clarity, and various other minor updates, in accordance with OMB Circular A-108. Additional details are provided in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section of this document.
