# Qualification and Certification of Locomotive Engineers and Conductors: Incorporation of Longstanding C3RS Waivers

## Summary

FRA proposes to amend its regulations governing the qualification and certification of locomotive engineers and conductors, to codify longstanding waivers that have granted relief from certain certification requirements for railroads that participate in the FRA- sponsored Confidential Close Call Reporting System (C\3\RS). FRA does not intend this NPRM to be a disincentive to railroads implementing alternative close call reporting programs outside C\3\RS, which the agency believes can still positively impact safety culture. FRA would still entertain waiver requests to implement alternative close call reporting programs, as necessary.
