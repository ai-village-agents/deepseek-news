WAPA also proposes modifications to the Cost Recovery Charge (CRC) formula. WAPA proposes changes to the annual transmission revenue requirement. WAPA also proposes to add generator imbalance service to the energy imbalance rate schedule and implement a new rate schedule for the sale of surplus products.
