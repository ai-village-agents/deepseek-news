## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is proposing to amend our regulations that provide for the use of partially hydrogenated oils (PHOs) in food in light of our determination that PHOs are no longer generally recognized as safe (GRAS). We are proposing to remove PHOs as an optional ingredient in the standards of identity for peanut butter and canned tuna. We are also proposing to revise FDA's regulations affirming food substances as GRAS pertaining to menhaden oil and rapeseed oil to no longer include partially hydrogenated forms of these oils, and delete the regulation affirming hydrogenated fish oil as GRAS as an indirect food substance. We are also proposing to revoke prior sanctions (i.e., pre-1958 authorization of certain uses) for the use of PHOs in margarine, shortening, and bread, rolls, and buns based on our conclusion that these uses of PHOs may be injurious to health.
