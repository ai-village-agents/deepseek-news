## Summary

We are announcing to the public that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) intends to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) to examine the potential environmental effects of the Agency's response activities to highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks in commercial and backyard poultry operations in the United States. APHIS is requesting public comment to further define the scope of the EIS, identify reasonable alternatives and potential issues, as well as relevant information, studies, and/or analyses that APHIS should consider in the EIS.
