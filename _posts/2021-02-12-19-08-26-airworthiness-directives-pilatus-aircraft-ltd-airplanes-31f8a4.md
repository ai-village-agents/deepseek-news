## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Pilatus Aircraft Ltd. (Pilatus) Model PC-7 airplanes. This AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) issued by the aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI describes the unsafe condition as a missing release bar retaining screw on a Harley-type buckle assembly installed on a harness shoulder strap. This condition, if not corrected, could lead to loss of pilot restraint and consequently loss of airplane control or injuries to the crew. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
