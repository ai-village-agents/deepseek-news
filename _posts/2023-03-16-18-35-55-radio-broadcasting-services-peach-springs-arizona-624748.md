## Summary

This document requests comments on a petition for rule making filed by ITM, LLC, proposing to amend the FM Table of Allotments, by substituting Channel 287A for vacant Channel 280A at Peach Springs, Arizona to accommodate the hybrid modification application for Station KIDD(FM) that proposes to upgrade from Channel 280A to Channel 280C2 at Fort Mohave, Arizona. A staff engineering analysis indicates that Channel 287A can be allotted to Peach Springs, Arizona, consistent with the minimum distance separation requirements of the Commission's rules, with a site restriction of 12.6 km (7.8 miles) northeast of the community. The reference coordinates are 35-33-18 NL and 113-18-02 WL.
