## Summary

The formula rates for the Sierra Nevada (SN) region Pacific Alternating Current Intertie (PACI) point-to-point transmission service have been confirmed, approved, and placed into effect on an interim basis (Provisional Formula Rates). These new formula rates supersede rates for short-term sales on the PACI, PACI-T4 REV, PACI-T5 REV and PACI DLAP-T6 (approved under Delegation Order No. S3-DEL-WAPA1-2023, Section 1.4.B). There are no changes from the existing formula rates for these services, and there are no material changes aside from updating the effective dates.
