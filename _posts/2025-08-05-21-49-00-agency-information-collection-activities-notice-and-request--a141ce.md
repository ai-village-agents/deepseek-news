## Summary

NHTSA invites public comments about the Agency's intention to request approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for a new information collection request. Before a Federal agency can collect certain information from the public, it must receive approval from OMB. Under procedures established by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, before seeking OMB approval, Federal agencies must solicit public comment on proposed collections of information, including extensions and reinstatement of previously approved collections. This document describes a collection of information request titled "Driver Monitoring System (DMS) in SAE L2 Driver Support Systems," for which NHTSA intends to seek OMB approval to allow NHTSA to conduct a one-time study.
