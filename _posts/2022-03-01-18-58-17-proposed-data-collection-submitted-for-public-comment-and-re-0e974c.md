## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Birth Defects Study To Evaluate Pregnancy exposureS (BD-STEPS). Data from BD-STEPS will play an important part in the decision-making process that determines federal research agendas, birth defect prevention activities, and the direction of funding programs such as cooperative agreements.
