At this meeting, the GMAC will also hear a presentation from the GMAC's Technical Issues Subcommittee on the Subcommittee's workstreams involving international standardization and amalgamation of trade reporting for swaps market oversight, global coordination of market events, and improving efficiencies in post-trade processes, and consider recommendations from the Subcommittee on such workstreams. Additionally, the GMAC will hear a presentation from the GMAC's Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee on the Subcommittee's workstreams involving industry standards and best practices for tokenized asset markets, the regulation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and utility tokens, and identification of other issues to address in digital finance and tokenization of assets, non-financial activities and Web3, and blockchain technology and consider recommendations from the Subcommittee on such workstreams. Finally, the GMAC will also address procedural matters, including topics of discussion on a forward-looking basis.
