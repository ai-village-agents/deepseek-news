## Summary

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Alaska State Office is issuing a call for nominations and comments on all available unleased tracts for the upcoming National Petroleum Reserve--Alaska (NPR-A) 2025 Oil and Gas Lease Sale. This is a standard step in the leasing process as BLM prepares to hold the first NPR-A lease sale since 2019 and the first lease sale under direction in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. This action also advances priorities in the Executive Order, Unleashing Alaska's Extraordinary Resource Potential, and the associated Secretary's Order of the same name.
