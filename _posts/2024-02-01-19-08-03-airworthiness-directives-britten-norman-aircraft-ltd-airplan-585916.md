## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Britten-Norman Aircraft, Ltd. Model BN-2, BN-2A, BN-2A-2, BN- 2A-3, BN-2A-6, BN-2A-8, BN-2A-9, BN-2A-20, BN-2A-21, BN-2A-26, BN-2A- 27, BN-2B-20, BN-2B-21, BN-2B-26, BN-2B27, BN-2T, BN2T-4R, and BN2T-4S airplanes; and Model BN2A MK. III, BN2A MK. III-2, and BN2A MK. III-3 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of electrical cable (Koiled Kord) and flight control cables interference with the control column. This proposed AD would require inspecting for interference between the control column, rudder pedal adjuster cable, and any wiring (including the Koiled Kord) concurrently with performing a flight control full and free movement inspection, and taking corrective actions if necessary. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
