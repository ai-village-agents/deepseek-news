## Summary

The FMCSA announces its decision to grant Daimler Coaches North America, LLC's (Daimler Coaches) application for a limited five- year exemption to allow its driver assistance camera technology (DACT) device to extend beyond the current mounting location limits in the lower area of the windshield on Tourrider commercial motorcoaches. The Agency has determined that higher placement of Daimler Coaches' DACT device would not have an adverse impact on safety and that adherence to the terms and conditions of the exemption would likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to, or greater than, the level of safety provided by the regulation.
