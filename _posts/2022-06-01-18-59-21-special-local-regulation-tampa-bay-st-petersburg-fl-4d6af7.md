## Summary

The Coast Guard is revising the existing special local regulations within the Seventh Coast Guard District Captain of the Port (COTP) St. Petersburg Zone by removing an event that no longer takes place, and by updating the location of an existing event. These changes are being made because one event sponsor halted the event for the forseeable future, and the other changed the event details.
