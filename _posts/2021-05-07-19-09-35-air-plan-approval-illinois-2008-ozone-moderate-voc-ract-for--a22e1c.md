## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve volatile organic compound (VOC) reasonably available control technology (RACT) State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions for the Illinois portion of the Chicago-Naperville, IL-IN-WI nonattainment area (Illinois portion) under the 2008 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard ("NAAQS" or "standard") submitted by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency ("Illinois" or "Illinois EPA") on January 10, 2019 and supplemented on April 30, 2020. EPA is also proposing to approve the Stepan Co. construction permit submitted by Illinois on March 29, 2021 as a revision to the Illinois SIP. The Illinois portion consists of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, and Will Counties and portions of Grundy (Aux Sable and Goose Lake Townships) and Kendall (Oswego Township) Counties. These VOC RACT SIP submittals satisfy the moderate VOC RACT requirements of section 182(b)(2) of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
