## Summary

The Department of Justice (DOJ), Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), will be submitting the following information collection request to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The proposed information collection was previously published in the Federal Register Volume 87, Number 31, page 8607, on Tuesday, February 15, 2022, allowing a 60-day comment period. Following publication of the 60-day notice, BJS received three comments. The first comment recommended use of a specific technology as a means to ease the burden on data providers. The second comment recommended the inclusion of people charged with misdemeanors. BJS did not make these changes; BJS has technology suitable to this data collection and misdemeanors would expand the scope of this data collection beyond what BJS feels can be achieved in this iteration. The third comment suggested a focus on electronic monitoring as a condition of release, which BJS feels the current data collection adequately addresses.
