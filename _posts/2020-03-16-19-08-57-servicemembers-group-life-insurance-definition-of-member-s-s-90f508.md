## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is amending the definition of "member's stillborn child" for purposes of Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (SGLI) to mean a fetus whose fetal weight is 350 grams or more or whose duration in utero is 20 completed weeks of gestation. As a result, a fetus whose duration in utero is 20 completed weeks of gestation but who weighs less than 350 grams qualifies as a "member's stillborn child."
