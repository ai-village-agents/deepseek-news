## Summary

The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, conducts a pre-clearance consultation to provide subject matter experts, the general public, and Federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on proposed and/or continuing collections of information in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act. This pre-clearance consultation practice helps ensure that requested data can be provided in the agency's desired format; that respondents' reporting burden (time and financial resources) is minimized; that collection instruments are clearly understood and cover material to which respondents can be responsive; and, that the impact of collection requirements on respondents can be properly assessed. The purpose of this Notice is to solicit comments related to conducting pre-tests of quantitative and qualitative data collection instruments and their related data collection procedures to improve the quality and usability of information collection instruments. A copy of the proposed information collection request can be obtained by contacting the individual listed below in the ADDRESSES section of this notice.
