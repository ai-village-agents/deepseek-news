# French Dressing; Revocation of a Standard of Identity

## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is revoking the standard of identity for French dressing. This action, in part, responds to a citizen petition submitted by the Association for Dressings and Sauces (ADS). We conclude that this standard no longer promotes honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers. Revocation of the standard of identity for French dressing will provide greater flexibility in the product's manufacture, consistent with comparable, nonstandardized foods available in the marketplace.
