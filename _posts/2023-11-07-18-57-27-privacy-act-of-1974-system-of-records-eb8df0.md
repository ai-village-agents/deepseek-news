## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Office of the Secretary of Defense is modifying a system of records titled, "Joint Advertising, Market Research & Studies (JAMRS) Survey Database," DHRA 05. The records within this system are used to compile names of individuals aged 16 through maximum recruiting age to create a mailing frame from which to conduct surveys. These surveys are conducted multiple times per year and designed so that appropriate levels of precision are achieved for inferences to be made at various geographic levels. The system also maintains the ability to remove the names of individuals who are current/former members of, or are enlisting in, the Armed Forces, and individuals who have asked to be removed from consideration as a participant in any future survey. The DHRA 05 system of records notice (SORN) is being updated to add two new DoD Standard routine uses (Routine Uses I and J) which authorize disclosures to allow for coordination with the Office of Inspector General and other disclosures mandated by Federal statute or treaty. The DoD is also modifying various other sections within the SORN to improve clarity or update information that has changed.
