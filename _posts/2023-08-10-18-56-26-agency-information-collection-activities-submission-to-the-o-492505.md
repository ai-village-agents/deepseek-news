## Summary

The Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM), invites the general public and other Federal Agencies to comment on the proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. As required by Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 (see section 8A(a)(1) of EXIM's charter), EXIM will survey U.S. exporters and commercial lending institutions to understand their experience with EXIM "meeting financial competition from other countries whose exporters compete with United States exporters." EXIM plans to survey exporters and lenders that have engaged with EXIM on medium- and long- term support over the previous calendar year or responded to at least one of EXIM's last two surveys. The potential respondents will be sent an electronic invitation to participate in the online survey.
