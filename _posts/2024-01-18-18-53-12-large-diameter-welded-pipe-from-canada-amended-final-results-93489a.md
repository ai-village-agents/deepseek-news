## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is amending the final results of the administrative review of the antidumping duty order on large diameter welded pipe (welded pipe) from Canada to correct a ministerial error. Based on the amended final results, we find that welded pipe from Canada was not sold in the United States at less than normal value (NV), during the period of review (POR), May 1, 2021, through April 30, 2022.
