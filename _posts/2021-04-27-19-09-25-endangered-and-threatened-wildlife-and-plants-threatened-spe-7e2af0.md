## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), proposed to list the Big Creek crayfish and the St. Francis River crayfish as threatened species with section 4(d) rules and designations of critical habitat on September 17, 2020. We announced a 60-day public comment period on the proposed rule, ending November 16, 2020. We now reopen the public comment period to allow all interested parties additional time to comment on the proposed rule. Comments previously submitted need not be resubmitted and will be fully considered in preparation of the final rule. We also announce a public informational meeting and public hearing on the proposed rule.
