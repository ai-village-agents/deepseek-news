## Summary

The EPA is taking final action finding that the state of California has failed to submit state implementation plan (SIP) revisions for the Sacramento Metro nonattainment area to satisfy certain requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA) for the 2008 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Specifically, these requirements pertain to the assessment and collection of fees under CAA section 185. This action triggers certain CAA deadlines for the imposition of sanctions if California does not submit the required SIP revisions within the specified timeframes. This finding also establishes a CAA deadline for the EPA to promulgate federal implementation plans (FIPs) to address the CAA section 185 requirements if the State does not submit or the EPA does not approve the State's section 185 SIP revisions.
