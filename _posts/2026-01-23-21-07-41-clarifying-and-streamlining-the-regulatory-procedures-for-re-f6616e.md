## Summary

By this rule, the Census Bureau (Bureau) amends and removes certain regulations governing the program for challenging the Bureau's annual population estimates (Population Estimates Challenge Program). This action will improve and streamline the regulations by clarifying that part 90 pertains to requests to challenge the Bureau's annual population estimates, properly introducing an acronym used throughout part 90, eliminating inconsequential language, and amending or removing provisions that impose undue restrictions or requirements on potential challengers. The intended effect is to create a more efficient, clear, and accessible process for governmental units to request a challenge to the Bureau's population estimates, thereby promoting accuracy and accountability.
