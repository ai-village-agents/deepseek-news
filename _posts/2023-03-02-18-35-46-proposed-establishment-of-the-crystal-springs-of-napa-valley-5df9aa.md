## Summary

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to establish the approximately 4,000-acre ``Crystal Springs of Napa Valley'' American viticultural area (AVA) in Napa County, California. The proposed AVA is located entirely within the existing North Coast AVA and also entirely within the Napa Valley AVA. TTB designates viticultural areas to allow vintners to better describe the origin of their wines and to allow consumers to better identify wines they may purchase. TTB invites comments on these proposals.
