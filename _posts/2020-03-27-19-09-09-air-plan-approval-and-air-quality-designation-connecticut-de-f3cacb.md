## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to determine that the Greater Connecticut Serious 8-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 2008 8-hour National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone, based on certified 2016-2018 ozone data. In addition, quality controlled and quality assured ozone data for 2019 that are available in the EPA Air Quality System, but not yet certified, do not conflict with the conclusion that this area attains the 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS. If this proposed determination is made final, the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions related to attainment of the 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS shall be suspended for so long as the area continues to attain the ozone NAAQS. This action is being taken under the Clean Air Act.
