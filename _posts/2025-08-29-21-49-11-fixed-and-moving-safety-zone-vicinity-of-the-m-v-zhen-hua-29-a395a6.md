## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing two temporary safety zones, a moving safety zone and a fixed safety zone, around the M/V ZHEN HUA 29 in the navigable waters of the Freeport Ship Channel and its vicinity. The temporary safety zones are necessary to protect persons, property, and the marine environment from potential hazards associated with the transit and delivery of large gantry cranes. People and vessels are prohibited from entering, transiting through, anchoring in, or remaining within the safety zones unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port (COTP) Houston-Galveston or a designated representative.
