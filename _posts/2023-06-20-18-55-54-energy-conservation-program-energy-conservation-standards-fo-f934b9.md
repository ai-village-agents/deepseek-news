# Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Microwave Ovens

## Summary

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended ("EPCA"), prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment, including microwave ovens. EPCA also requires the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") to periodically determine whether more stringent standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and whether they would result in significant energy savings. In this final rule, DOE is adopting amended energy conservation standards for microwave ovens. It has determined that the amended energy conservation standards for these products would result in significant conservation of energy and are technologically feasible and economically justified.
