## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE or the Department) is establishing a categorical exclusion for authorization, siting, construction, operation, reauthorization, and decommissioning of advanced nuclear reactors for inclusion in its National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) implementing procedures. DOE is including the categorical exclusion in the component of its NEPA implementing procedures that it maintains outside of the Code of Federal Regulations. The new categorical exclusion is based on the experience of DOE and other Federal agencies, current technologies, regulatory requirements, and accepted industry practice.
