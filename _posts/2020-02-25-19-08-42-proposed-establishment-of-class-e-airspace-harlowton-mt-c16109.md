## Summary

This action proposes to establish Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface at the Wheatland County at Harlowton Airport, Harlowton, MT. The FAA proposes to establish two Class E airspace areas. The first area extends upward from 700 feet above the surface and the second area extends upward from 1,200 feet above the surface. The establishment of the Class E airspace will, to the extent possible, contain the new area navigation (RNAV) approach procedure and instrument flight rules (IFR) departures. The new procedures facilitate the airport's transition from visual flight rules (VFR) to IFR operations. This action would ensure the safety and management of IFR operations at the airport.
