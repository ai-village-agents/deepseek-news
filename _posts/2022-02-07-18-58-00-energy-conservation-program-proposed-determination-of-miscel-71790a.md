## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") has tentatively determined that miscellaneous gas products, which are comprised of decorative hearths and outdoor heaters, qualify as covered products under Part A of Title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended ("EPCA"). DOE has tentatively determined that coverage of miscellaneous gas products is necessary and appropriate to carry out the purposes of EPCA, and that the average U.S. household energy use for miscellaneous gas products is likely to exceed 100 kilowatt-hours per year.
