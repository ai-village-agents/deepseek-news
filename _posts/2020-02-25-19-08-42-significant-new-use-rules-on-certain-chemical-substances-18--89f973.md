## Summary

EPA issued final significant new use rules (SNURs) in the Federal Register of November 25, 2019 for 22 chemical substances that were the subject of premanufacture notices (PMNs) (SNUR batch 18-1), and in in the Federal Register of December 5, 2019 for 29 chemical substances that were the subject of PMNs (SNUR batch 18-4). In SNUR batch 18-1, for the chemical substance that was the subject of PMN P- 15-114, EPA made errors in the SNUR requirements for hazard communication and protection in the workplace, resulting in inconsistencies with the same requirements in the associated TSCA Order. For SNUR batch 18-4, for one of the two chemical substances that are subject to the SNUR, EPA made a typographical error when identifying the associated PMN number in the SNUR. Additionally, for two other SNURs, language in the SNURs incorrectly refers to requirements in "the TSCA Order" rather than in the SNUR itself. This document is being issued to correct these errors.
