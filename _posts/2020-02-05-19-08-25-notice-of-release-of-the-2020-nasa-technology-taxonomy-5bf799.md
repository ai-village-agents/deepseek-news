## Summary

NASA has officially released the 2020 NASA Technology Taxonomy via the NASA Office of the Chief Technologist website. The Technology Taxonomy provides a structure for articulating the technology development disciplines needed to enable future NASA missions. This update to the previous structure uses a technology discipline-based approach that aligns like-technologies independent of their application within the NASA mission portfolio. The Taxonomy serves as a common technology communication tool across the Agency and with its partners in other government agencies, academia, industry, and around the world.
