## Summary

In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice announces that the Information Collection Request (ICR) abstracted below has been forwarded to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for emergency approval of a proposed information collection. DOT requests that OMB authorize this collection of information on or before June 15, 2022. Upon receiving the requested six-month emergency approval by OMB, DOT will follow the normal PRA procedures to obtain extended approval for this proposed information collection. The purpose of this collection is to enable public transportation providers, local governmental entities, States and federally recognized Tribes that operate a public ferry system to apply for grant assistance under the Passenger Ferry Grant Program, Electric or Low-Emitting Ferry Pilot Program and Ferry Service for Rural Communities. DOT is requesting emergency approval due to the urgency of making the associated funds available to public transportation providers, local governmental entities, States and federally recognized Tribes that meet the eligibility requirements under the law. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and their expected burdens.
