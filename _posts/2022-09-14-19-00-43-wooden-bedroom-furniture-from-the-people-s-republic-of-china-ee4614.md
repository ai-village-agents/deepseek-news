## Summary

As a result of the respective determinations by the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) order on wooden bedroom furniture from the People's Republic of China (China) would likely lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping and material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is publishing this notice of continuation of the AD order.
