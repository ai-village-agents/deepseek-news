## Summary

This final rule implements regulations for Amendment 32 to the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan. The regulations include a suite of changes to non-trawl sector area management measures seaward of California and Oregon. The purpose of Amendment 32 is to provide fishing access to healthy groundfish stocks for non-trawl groundfish fisheries and the directed commercial Pacific halibut fishery while still meeting the conservation objectives of the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan. In addition, this final rule implements minor administrative revisions to the regulations to correct the name of the Cordell Bank Groundfish Conservation Area, amend the description of the Cordell Bank Groundfish Conservation Area, add new regulatory definitions for different types of fishing bait, and add new exemptions to Vessel Monitoring System reporting requirements.
