## Summary

The Department is proposing revisions to regulations under the Black Lung Benefits Act (BLBA or the Act) governing authorization of self-insurers. These proposed rules will determine the process for coal mine operators to apply for authorization to self-insure, the requirements operators must meet to qualify to self-insure, the amount of security self-insured operators must provide, and the process for operators to appeal determinations made by the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP).
