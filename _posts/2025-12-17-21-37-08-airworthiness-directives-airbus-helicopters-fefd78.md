## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-01-04, which applies to all Airbus Helicopters Model AS350B, AS350BA, AS350B1, AS350B2, AS350B3, AS350D, AS355E, AS355F, AS355F1, AS355F2, AS355N, and AS355NP helicopters. AD 2023-01-04 requires, for helicopters with certain part-numbered tail rotor head (TRH) spider pitch change units installed, inspecting the spider pitch change nut (nut) for correct installation; marking a 2 to 5 mm wide black paint index mark and repetitively inspecting the alignment of the marking; and performing additional inspections and corrective actions if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2023-01-04, new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations were issued, which terminated the requirement for the repetitive inspections of the black paint index marking. This proposed AD would require the same actions of AD 2023-01-04, except for the repetitive black paint index marking inspection and would prohibit installing certain parts unless certain requirements are met. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
