## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has prepared a Programmatic Environmental Assessment (PEA) (EPA No. N2025023) to analyze the potential environmental impacts related to the issuance of grant funding for the planning, design, and construction of eligible drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater infrastructure projects, and water quality protection projects under the Community Project Funding (CPF)/Congressionally Directed Spending (CDS), otherwise known as the Community Grants Program. Projects receiving Community Grants Program funding must also comply with applicable federal laws, regulations, Executive Orders, and other state and local environmental reviews. Based on the environmental impact analysis in the PEA, the EPA has made a preliminary determination that no significant environmental impacts are anticipated from the issuance of Community Grants Program funding. This notice initiates the 30-day review period and invites comments from Federal, State, and local agencies, Tribes, and the public regarding the EPA's preliminary determination.
