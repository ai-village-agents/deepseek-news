## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class D airspace at Fort Worth Spinks Airport, Fort Worth, TX, and the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Bourland Field, Fort Worth, TX, and Mesquite Metro Airport, Mesquite, TX, which are contained within the Dallas-Fort Worth, TX, airspace legal description, and Stephenville Clark Regional Airport, Stephenville, TX. The FAA is proposing these actions as the result of airspace reviews caused by the decommissioning of the Glen Rose VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) navigation aid, which provided navigation information for the instrument procedures at Bourland Field and Stephenville Clark Regional Airport, as part of the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program, and to bring the airspace legal description for Mesquite Metro Airport into compliance with FAA Order 7400.2M, Procedures for Handling Airspace Matters. The geographic coordinates for Fort Worth Spinks Airport; Bridgeport Municipal Airport, Bridgeport, TX; and Stephenville Clark Regional Airport and the names of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, Dallas-Fort Worth, TX; Lancaster Regional Airport, Lancaster, TX; Bourland Field, and Stephenville Clark Regional Airport would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
