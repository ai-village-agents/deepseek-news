## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Public Health Accreditation Board (PHAB): Assessment of Processes and Outcomes. The purpose of this Extension is to collect information from health departments throughout the initial accreditation and reaccreditation process to learn about program processes and the accreditation/reaccreditation standards, to improve the program's quality, and to document program outcomes and inform decision making about future program direction.
