## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is withdrawing Regulatory Guides (RGs) in Division 6, "Products," (RGs 6.1, 6.2, 6.4, 6.5, and 6.9), and Division 10, "General," (RGs 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, 10.7, 10.8, and 10.9). These RGs are being withdrawn because there is more up-to-date guidance in the NUREG-1556 Series, "Consolidated Guidance About Materials Licenses," making these RGs obsolete.
