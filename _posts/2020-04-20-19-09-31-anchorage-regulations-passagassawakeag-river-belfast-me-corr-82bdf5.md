## Summary

On July 8, 2019, the Coast Guard published a final rule that established two special anchorage areas in the Passagassawakeag River in the vicinity of Belfast, ME, effective August 7, 2019. That rule contained errors in the coordinates describing the boundaries of these special anchorage areas, causing parts of them to extend into the navigable channel. This document corrects those errors.
