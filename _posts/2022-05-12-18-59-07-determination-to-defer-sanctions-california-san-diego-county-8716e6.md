## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is making an interim final determination that the State of California has submitted rules that satisfy the requirements of part D of the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act") permitting program for areas under the jurisdiction of the San Diego County Air Pollution Control District (SDAPCD or "District"). This determination is based on a proposed approval, published elsewhere in this Federal Register, of District rules addressing these requirements. The effect of this interim final determination is to defer the imposition of sanctions that were triggered by a previous EPA action that included a limited disapproval of the District's rules.
