## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is denying a petition for rulemaking (PRM), dated August 1, 2022, submitted by Ralph O. Meyer. The petition requested that the NRC amend its regulations regarding the licensing safety analysis for loss-of-coolant accidents. The petition was docketed on August 1, 2022, and was assigned Docket No. PRM-50-124. The NRC is denying the petition because the NRC is addressing emergency core cooling system performance with a risk- informed and performance-based regulatory approach rather than a deterministic approach as suggested by the petitioner.
