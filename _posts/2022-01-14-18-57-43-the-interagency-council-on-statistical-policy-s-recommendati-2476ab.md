## Summary

As part of the implementation of the Foundations for Evidence- Based Policymaking Act of 2018, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requests comments on the Interagency Council on Statistical Policy's recommendation for a Standard Application Process (SAP) for requesting access to certain confidential data assets. The SAP is to be a process through which agencies, the Congressional Budget Office, State, local, and Tribal governments, researchers, and other individuals, as appropriate, may apply to access confidential data assets accessed or acquired by a statistical agency or unit for the purposes of developing evidence. This new process would be implemented while maintaining stringent controls to protect confidentiality and privacy, as required by the law.
