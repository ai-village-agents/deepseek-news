## Summary

The Department of Defense (DoD or Department) is giving concurrent notification of a new Department-wide system of records titled "DoD Historical Records," DoD-0014, and this rulemaking, which exempts portions of this system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, because of national security requirements. This rule is being published as a direct final rule because the Department does not expect to receive any adverse comments. If such comments are received, this direct final rule will be withdrawn and a proposed rule for comments will be published.
