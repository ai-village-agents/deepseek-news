## Summary

Through this notice, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announces that the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) is extending the designation of Venezuela for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 18 months, effective September 10, 2022 through March 10, 2024. This extension allows currently eligible TPS beneficiaries to retain TPS through March 10, 2024, so long as they otherwise continue to meet the eligibility requirements for TPS. Existing TPS beneficiaries who wish to extend their status through March 10, 2024 must re-register during the re-registration period. This notice sets forth procedures necessary for Venezuelan nationals (and individuals having no nationality who last habitually resided in Venezuela) to re- register for TPS and to apply for Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) with U.S Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). USCIS will issue new EADs with a March 10, 2024 expiration date to eligible beneficiaries under Venezuela's TPS designation who timely re-register and apply for EADs under this extension.
