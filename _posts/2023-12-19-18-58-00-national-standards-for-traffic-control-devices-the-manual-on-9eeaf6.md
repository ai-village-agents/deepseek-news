## Summary

The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways (MUTCD) (also referred to as "the Manual") is incorporated by reference within our regulations, approved by FHWA, and recognized as the national standard for traffic control devices used on all public roads, bikeways, or private roads open to public travel. The purpose of this final rule is to revise Standard, Guidance, Option provisions, and supporting information, relating to the traffic control devices in all parts of the MUTCD to improve safety for all road users by promoting uniformity, and to incorporate new provisions that reflect technological advances in traffic control device application. The MUTCD, with these changes incorporated, is being designated as the 11th Edition of the MUTCD.
