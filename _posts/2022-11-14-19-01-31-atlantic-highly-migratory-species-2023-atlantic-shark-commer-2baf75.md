## Summary

This final rule adjusts the quotas and retention limits and establishes the opening date for the 2023 fishing year for the Atlantic commercial shark fisheries. Quotas are adjusted as required or allowable based on underharvests from the 2022 fishing year. NMFS establishes the opening date and commercial retention limits to provide, to the extent practicable, fishing opportunities for commercial shark fishermen in all regions and areas. The final measures could affect fishing opportunities for commercial shark fishermen in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea.
