## Summary

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) is issuing this final rule amending the regulation text and official interpretations for Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). The Bureau calculates the dollar amounts for provisions in Regulation Z annually; this final rule revises the amounts for provisions implementing TILA and its amendments, including the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994 (HOEPA), and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). The Bureau adjusts these amounts based on the annual percentage change of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as of June 1, 2025.
