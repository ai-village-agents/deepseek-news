## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is making an interim final determination that the California Air Resources Board (CARB) has submitted a rule and other materials on behalf of the Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District (MDAQMD or "District") that correct deficiencies in its Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act") state implementation plan (SIP) provisions concerning reasonably available control technology (RACT) ozone nonattainment requirements for controlling emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from internal combustion engines. This determination is based on a proposed approval, published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, of MDAQMD's Rule 1160 which regulates this source category. The effect of this interim final determination is that the imposition of sanctions that were triggered by a previous limited disapproval by the EPA in 2021 is now deferred. If the EPA finalizes its approval of MDAQMD's submission, relief from these sanctions will become permanent.
