## Summary

The Department of State intends to seek emergency processing of proposed form DS-5540, Public Charge Questionnaire from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The Department will seek OMB approval of the form by February 24, 2020, so that the Department can implement its interim final rule on the public charge ground of visa ineligibility on this date. The Department also intends to respond, in the supporting statement drafted in support of the request for OMB approval, to public comments that it received in response to its request for public comments on the same form DS-5540 that was published in the Federal Register on October 24. The Department will publish another notice in the Federal Register once it has requested emergency processing from OMB.
