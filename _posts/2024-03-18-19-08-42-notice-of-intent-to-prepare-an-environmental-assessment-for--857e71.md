## Summary

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) intends to prepare an environmental assessment (EA) to consider the potential environmental impacts associated with possible wind energy-related leasing, site characterization activities, and site assessment activities on the U.S. Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) in the Gulf of Maine offshore the States of Maine and New Hampshire and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. BOEM is seeking public input regarding important environmental issues and the identification of reasonable alternatives that should be considered in the EA. The environmental impacts of any proposed wind energy projects will be assessed after a lease is issued and before BOEM decides whether or not to approve any lessee's project construction and operations plan.
