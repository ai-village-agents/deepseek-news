## Summary

The National Park Service amends its special regulations for Glen Canyon National Recreation Area to manage the use of motor vehicles on and off park roads. The rule requires a permit to operate a motor vehicle off roads in selected locations, designates routes and areas where motor vehicles may be used off roads, and allows the superintendent to establish closures and restrictions based upon specific criteria. The rule also allows certain types of off-road vehicles on some paved and unpaved roads in the recreation area. Unless provided for by special regulation, operating a motor vehicle off roads within areas of the National Park System is prohibited.
