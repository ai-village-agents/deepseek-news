## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to grant a limited 5-year exemption to Pi Variables, Inc. (Pi Variables) to allow Pi-Lit Smart Sequential Road Flares (LED flares) to be deployed when commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) are stopped upon the traveled portion of a highway or the shoulder of a highway for any cause other than necessary traffic stops. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) require one of the following warning devices to be deployed when a CMV is stopped upon the traveled portion of a highway or the shoulder of a highway for any cause other than necessary traffic stops: three bidirectional emergency reflective triangles; at least 6 fusees or at least 3 liquid-burning flares. The vehicle must have as many additional fusees or liquid-burning flares as are necessary to satisfy the regulatory requirements. Other warning devices may be used in addition to, but not in lieu of, the required warning devices, provided they do not decrease the effectiveness of the required devices. The Agency has determined that granting the exemption would likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to or greater than the level of safety provided by the FMCSRs.
