## Summary

The Coast Guard is temporarily modifying the operating schedule that governs the Morrison Bridge across the Willamette River, mile 12.8, at Portland, OR. Multnomah County, Oregon, the bridge owner, is requesting to change the current regulation to allow painting and preservation of the Morrison Bridge including the double bascule span. The modified rule would change normal bridge operations from a full span opening to a single leaf, or half span opening.
