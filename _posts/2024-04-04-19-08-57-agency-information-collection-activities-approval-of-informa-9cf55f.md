## Summary

The proposed information collection request (ICR) renewal described below will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA). The Department of Transportation (DOT) is soliciting public comments on this proposed collection renewal. The collection is necessary for administration of the Multimodal Project Discretionary Grants (MPDG). This includes three funding opportunities: the "National Infrastructure Project Assistance grants program (Mega)," the "Nationally Significant Multimodal Freight and Highways Projects grants program (INFRA)", and the "Rural Surface Transportation Grant program (Rural)". The MPDG provides Federal financial assistance for surface transportation infrastructure projects--including highway and bridge, intercity passenger rail, railway-highway grade and separation, wildlife crossing, public transportation, marine highway, and freight and multimodal projects, or groups of such projects, of national or regional significance, as well as to projects to improve and expand the surface transportation infrastructure in rural areas. The DOT on its own made additional changes to update time and estimated costs. Additionally, DOT removed the program evaluation stage (survey) and will submit that separately if conducted.
