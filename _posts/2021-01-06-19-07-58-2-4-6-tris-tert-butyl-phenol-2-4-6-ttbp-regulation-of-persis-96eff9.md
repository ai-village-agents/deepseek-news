## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing a rule under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to address its obligations under TSCA for 2,4,6-tris(tert-butyl)phenol (2,4,6-TTBP) (CASRN 732-26-3), which EPA has determined meets the requirements for expedited action under TSCA. This final rule prohibits the distribution in commerce of 2,4,6-TTBP and products containing 2,4,6-TTBP at concentrations above 0.3% in any container with a volume of less than 35 gallons for any use, in order to effectively prevent the use of 2,4,6-TTBP as an antioxidant in fuel additives or fuel injector cleaners by consumers and small commercial operations (e.g., automotive repair shops, marinas). This final rule also prohibits the processing and distribution in commerce of 2,4,6-TTBP, and products containing 2,4,6-TTBP at concentrations above 0.3 percent by weight, for use as an oil or lubricant additive, regardless of container size. These requirements will reduce the exposure to humans and the environment, by reducing the potential for consumer exposures to 2,4,6-TTBP and potential occupational exposure in certain industries where workers are unprotected, as well as potential releases to the environment from consumer and small commercial operations use.
