# Electronic Detonators

## Summary

The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is proposing to revise certain safety standards for explosives at metal and nonmetal (MNM) mines. This proposed rule updates existing provisions consistent with technological advancements involving electronic detonators. Elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, MSHA is also publishing a direct final rule because the Agency expects that there will be no significant adverse comments on the rule. If no significant adverse comments are received, the Agency will confirm the effective date of the final rule. If a significant adverse comment is received, MSHA will withdraw the direct final rule and proceed with this proposed rule. MSHA intends to publish a Federal Register notice announcing the Agency's action. This proposed rule and the companion direct final rule are substantially identical.
