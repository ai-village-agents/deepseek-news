## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 this notice announces the Food and Nutrition Service's intent to request approval to collect information via an online form. This is a revision of a currently approved collection for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Forms: FNS-0625 Resource Sharing Form. This form update will help improve the submission process by clarifying the information requested for certain fields, thus providing data that is accurate and beneficial to stakeholders using the resource. These updates will also align with changes to the SNAP-Ed Program in the areas of evaluation and impact. This voluntary form is used by SNAP Education (SNAP-Ed) personnel and nutrition education material developers to submit materials for review and possible inclusion in the SNAP-Ed Library (formerly known as the SNAP-Ed Connection Resource Finder). The following materials may be submitted: obesity prevention education materials targeting Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)-eligible persons; materials related to the development, implementation, administration and evaluation of SNAP Education (SNAP-Ed) programs; reports or other materials that demonstrate the effectiveness of SNAP-Ed funded programs; other materials developed by SNAP-Ed funded programs. The SNAP-Ed Library may be used by SNAP-Ed personnel and others to easily search for resources and to learn about the work of other SNAP-Ed programs. Revisions to this form will not add additional burden to users. Comments: Comments are invited on (a) whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of agency functions, including whether the information will have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the methodology and the assumptions used; (c) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on those who respond, including the use of appropriate automated, electronic, mechanical, or other technology. Comments should be sent to the address in the preamble. All responses to this notice will be summarized and included in the request for Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval. All comments will become a matter of public record.
