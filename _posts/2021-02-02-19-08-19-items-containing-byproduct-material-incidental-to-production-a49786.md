## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is requesting comment on a regulatory basis to support developing a rulemaking that would amend its regulations by adding a new class exemption from licensing and associated distribution requirements. This new class exemption would create a path for licensing current and future products that contain byproduct material incidental to their production. The rulemaking would resolve a petition for rulemaking (PRM), PRM-30-65, submitted by GE Osmonics, Inc. on April 18, 2011, requesting changes to the regulations to allow commercial distribution and redistribution of polycarbonate track etched membranes.
