## Summary

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) revised Circular No. A-94 in 1992. With that action, OMB specified certain discount rates to be updated annually when the interest rate and inflation assumptions used to prepare the Budget of the United States Government were changed. These updated discount rates are found in Appendix C of the Circular and are to be used for cost-effectiveness analysis, including lease-purchase analysis, as specified in the revised Circular. These rates do not apply to regulatory analysis. The revised Circular can be accessed at https://www.whitehouse.gov/ wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Appendix-C.pdf.
