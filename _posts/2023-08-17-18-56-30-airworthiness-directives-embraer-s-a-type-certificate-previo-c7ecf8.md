# Airworthiness Directives; Embraer S.A. (Type Certificate Previously Held by Yaborã Indústria Aeronáutica S.A.; Embraer S.A.) Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Embraer S.A. Model ERJ 190-100 STD, -100 LR, -100 IGW, -200 STD, -200 LR, and -200 IGW airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary and a determination by the design approval holder (DAH) that some structural elements are subject to widespread fatigue damage (WFD). This proposed AD would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, and for certain airplanes would require a structural modification of the wing lower skin panels, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
