## Summary

As a result of the determinations by the Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the International Trade Commission (ITC) in their five-year (sunset) reviews that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) orders on heavy walled rectangular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes (HWR pipes and tubes) from the Republic of Korea (Korea), Mexico, and the Republic of Turkey (Turkey) and the countervailing duty (CVD) order on HWR pipes and tubes from Turkey would likely lead to a continuation or recurrence of dumping and net countervailable subsidies, and material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation of the AD orders on HWR pipes and tubes from Korea, Mexico, and Turkey, and the CVD order on HWR pipes and tubes from Turkey.
