## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC, the Commission) received and is considering approval of an indirect license transfer application filed by El Paso Electric Company (EPE) on March 18, 2021. The application seeks NRC approval of the indirect transfer of EPE's possession-only non-operating interests in Renewed Facility Operating License Nos. NPF-41, NPF-51, and NPF-74 for Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station (Palo Verde), Units 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and the general license for the Palo Verde Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI) as a result of the acquisition of an approximately 33.3 percent membership interest in IIF US Holding 2 GP, LLC (IIF US 2 GP)--the general partner of IIF US Holding 2 LP (IIF US 2)--by a private individual, Anne Cleary, subsequent to the retirement and relinquishment of an approximately 33.3 percent IIF US 2 GP membership interest held by Dennis Clarke.
