## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is re-issuing a general permit under the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) to authorize the transport of marine mammal and sea turtle carcasses from the United States and disposal of marine mammal and sea turtle carcasses in ocean waters. Permit re-issuance is necessary because the most recent permit expired on January 4, 2024. The EPA has not made substantive changes to the content of the recently expired general permit, though it has revised the scope and eligibility provisions, and general permittees will be able to resume permitted deposition of marine mammal carcasses in ocean waters pursuant to the re-issued permit terms.
