## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing conditional approval of portions of State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions to Colorado Air Quality Control Commission (Commission or AQCC) Regulation Number 7 (Reg. 7), which address Colorado's SIP obligation to require reasonably available control technology (RACT) for sources covered by the 2008 miscellaneous metal and plastic parts coatings (miscellaneous metal coatings) control techniques guidelines (CTG) and major source nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) for Moderate nonattainment areas under the 2008 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). These revisions address all of the remaining pieces of the May 31, 2017 and May 10, 2019 submittals that we have not previously acted on. The EPA is taking this action pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA).
