## Summary

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has received a written request to make a determination that the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) preempts a New York State commercial financing law with respect to certain provisions. The CFPB is publishing this notification of intent to make a preemption determination about that law and has made a preliminary conclusion that this law is not preempted by TILA. The CFPB is also providing notice that it is considering whether to make a preemption determination regarding State laws in California, Utah, and Virginia that are potentially similar to the New York law. The CFPB is soliciting public comment pursuant to Regulation Z.
