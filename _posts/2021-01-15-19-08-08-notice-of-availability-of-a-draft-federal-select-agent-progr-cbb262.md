## Summary

We are advising the public that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is making a draft Federal Select Agent Program (FSAP) policy statement related to brucella available. This policy statement will aid individuals and entities on how to develop biosafety plans for outdoor host animal studies involving swine, elk, bison, and cattle to further brucellosis research in accordance with the select agent and toxin regulations, as well as how to submit such plans to FSAP (administered jointly by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and APHIS) for approval. We are making this draft policy statement available to the public for review and comment. This notice is being issued as a companion to a notice issued by CDC, which is also published in today's Federal Register.
