## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the Iowa State Implementation Plan (SIP) to include recent changes to the Linn County Code of Ordinances. The revisions to this rule include updating definitions and references to federal rules, revising methods and procedures for performance test/ stack test and continuous monitoring systems, and making minor clarifications and grammatical changes. These revisions do not impact the stringency of the SIP or have an adverse effect on air quality. The EPA's proposed approval of this rule revision is being done in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
