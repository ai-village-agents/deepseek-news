## Summary

The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) amends the Northern Potato Crop Insurance--Quality Endorsement; Northern Potato Crop Insurance--Processing Quality Endorsement; Potato Crop Insurance-- Certified Seed Endorsement; and Northern Potato Crop Insurance--Storage Coverage Endorsement. The intended effect of this action is to specify that the premium is only applicable for planted acreage under these Endorsements. The Endorsements are designed to protect against losses associated with the final harvested crop (potatoes). For example, the Northern Potato Crop Insurance--Storage Coverage Endorsement extends crop insurance coverage for potatoes that have been harvested and are in storage. Acreage prevented from planting would not need coverage that is specifically designed for a final harvested crop. FCIC is revising the Endorsements to specify that the additional premium (for the Endorsements) is only applicable for planted acreage. The changes to the policies made in this rule are applicable for the 2022 and succeeding crop years for crops with a contract change date on or after April 30, 2021.
