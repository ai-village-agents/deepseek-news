## Summary

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services intends to request approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for a generic clearance to request information from potential participants at ACF gatherings, such as meetings or conferences. The planning for these gatherings is most often on a quick timeline and the standard timeline to comply with a full request under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) would inhibit the ability to collect information to inform these activities. Therefore, an umbrella generic is requested to allow for quick turnaround requests for similar information collections related to these activities.
