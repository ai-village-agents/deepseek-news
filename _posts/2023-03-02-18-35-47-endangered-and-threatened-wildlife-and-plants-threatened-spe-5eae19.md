## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), determine threatened species status under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended, for the Upper Coosa River distinct population segment (DPS) of the frecklebelly madtom (Noturus munitus), a fish species. We are also finalizing a rule under section 4(d) of the Act to provide for conservation of the species. In addition, we designate critical habitat for the Upper Coosa River DPS under the Act. In total, approximately 134 river miles (216 kilometers) in Georgia and Tennessee fall within the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. This rule applies the protections of the Act to this species and its designated critical habitat.
