Section 9(a) of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 ("NVRA") and Section 802 of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 ("HAVA") requires the responsible agency to maintain a national mail voter registration form for U.S. citizens that want to register to vote, to update registration information due to a change of name, make a change of address or to register with a political party by returning the form to their state election office.
