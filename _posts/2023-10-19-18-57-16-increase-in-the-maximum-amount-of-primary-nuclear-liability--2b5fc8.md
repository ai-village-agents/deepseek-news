## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations to increase the required amount of primary nuclear liability insurance from $450 million to $500 million for each nuclear reactor that is licensed to operate, is designed for the production of electrical energy, and has a rated capacity of 100,000 electrical kilowatts or more. This change complies with the provision in the Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988 that states the amount of primary financial protection required of licensees by the NRC shall be the maximum amount available at reasonable cost and on reasonable terms from private sources.
