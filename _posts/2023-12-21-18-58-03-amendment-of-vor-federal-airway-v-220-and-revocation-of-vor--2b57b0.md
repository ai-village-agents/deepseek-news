## Summary

This action proposes to amend Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal Airway V-220 and revoke VOR Federal Airways V-79 and V-380. The FAA is proposing this action due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Hastings, NE (HSI), VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) navigational aid (NAVAID). The Hastings VOR is being decommissioned in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.
