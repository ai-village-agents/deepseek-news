## Summary

Nationwide Permits (NWPs) authorize activities under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 that have no more than minimal individual and cumulative adverse environmental effects. The NWPs help protect the aquatic environment and the public interest by providing incentives to reduce impacts to jurisdictional waters. In this final action, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) is reissuing 56 existing nationwide permits (NWPs), general conditions, and definitions, with some modifications. The Corps is also issuing one new NWP.
