## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the District of Columbia. This revision satisfies the nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) reasonably available control technology (RACT) requirements under the 2008 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standard (2008 ozone NAAQS). The District of Columbia's NO<INF>X</INF> RACT submittal for the 2008 ozone NAAQS: Amends existing regulatory provisions to add new or more stringent regulations or controls that represent RACT control levels for combustion turbines and associated heat recovery steam generators and duct burners, amends the applicability provisions of these regulations to include all combustion turbines and associated heat recovery steam generators and duct burners, and adds conforming definitions; includes a source specific NO<INF>X</INF> RACT determination for four specific emissions units at one major stationary source of NO<INF>X</INF>; includes a certification that, for other categories of sources, controls already approved by EPA into the District of Columbia's SIP to meet NO<INF>X</INF> RACT for previous ozone NAAQS are based on technically and economically feasible controls and continue to represent NO<INF>X</INF> RACT for 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS implementation purposes; and in an effort to clean-up its SIP, removes carbon monoxide (CO) emissions limits for combustion turbines that no longer exist in the District of Columbia. This action is being taken under the Clean Air Act (CAA).
