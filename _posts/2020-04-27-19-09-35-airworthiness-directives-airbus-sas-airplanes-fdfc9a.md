# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus SAS Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A330-941 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that seven spoiler servo-controls (SSCs) lost hydraulic locking function due to a sheared seal on the blocking valve. This proposed AD would require repetitive operational tests of the hydraulic locking function on each SSC and replacement if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which will be incorporated by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
