## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-22- 09, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A350-1041 airplanes. AD 2022-22-09 required replacing affected hydro-mechanical units (HMUs) with serviceable HMUs before reaching a reduced life limit and limited the installation of affected parts under certain conditions. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-22-09, an improved HMU was developed and embodied in production. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2022-22-09. This AD also requires replacing affected HMUs with improved HMUs and prohibits the installation of affected parts under certain conditions and on certain airplanes. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
