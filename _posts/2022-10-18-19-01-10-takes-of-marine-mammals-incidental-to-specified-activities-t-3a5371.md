## Summary

NMFS received a request from Chesapeake Tunnel Joint Venture (CTJV) for the renewal of their currently active incidental harassment authorization (IHA) to take marine mammals incidental to the Parallel Thimble Shoal Tunnel Project (PTST) in Virginia Beach, Virginia. These activities are nearly identical to those covered in the current authorization, and include a subset of the initial work. Pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act, prior to issuing the currently active IHA, NMFS requested comments on both the proposed IHA and the potential for renewing the initial authorization if certain requirements were satisfied. The renewal requirements have been satisfied, and NMFS is now providing an additional 15-day comment period to allow for any additional comments on the proposed renewal not previously provided during the initial 30-day comment period.
