## Summary

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) invites public comment on a new Information Collection Request (ICR) abstracted below that we will submit to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval in compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected burden. The collection involves the basic point of contact information on the person/organization requesting a TSA speaker, the logistical information for that speaking engagement, and context for the request to determine the audience reach, ethical concerns, and possible promotion of the speaking engagement.
