## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily determines that the sole mandatory respondent under review sold subject merchandise at less than normal value (NV) during the period of review (POR) April 1, 2021, through March 31, 2022. Additionally, Commerce preliminarily finds that one company had no shipments of subject merchandise during the POR and that it is appropriate to rescind this review with respect to 22 companies because all requests for review of these companies were withdrawn. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.
