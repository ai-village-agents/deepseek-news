## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce 90- day findings on petitions to add four species to the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Based on our review, we find that the petitions to list the common hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius), Morro Bay polyphyllan scarab beetle (Polyphylla morroensis), Inyo rock daisy (Perityle inyoensis; synonym Laphamia inyoensis), and roughhead shiner (Notropis semperasper) present substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned actions may be warranted. Therefore, with the publication of this document, we announce that we are initiating status reviews of these species to determine whether the petitioned actions are warranted. To ensure that the status reviews are comprehensive, we request scientific and commercial data and other information regarding the species and factors that may affect their status. Based on the status reviews, we will issue 12-month petition findings, which will address whether or not the petitioned actions are warranted, in accordance with the Act.
