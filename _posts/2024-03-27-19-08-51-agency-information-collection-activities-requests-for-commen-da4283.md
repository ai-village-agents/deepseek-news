## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on November 22, 2023. The collection involves electronic information that is broadcast directly from certain unmanned aircraft, specifically standard remote identification unmanned aircraft and unmanned aircraft equipped with a remote identification broadcast module. The collection of this information in the remote identification message elements is necessary to comply with the FAA's statutory requirement to develop and implement standards for remotely identifying operators and owners of unmanned aircraft. The collection of this information will also provide airspace awareness to enable the FAA, national security agencies, and law enforcement entities to distinguish compliant airspace users from those potentially posing a safety or security risk.
