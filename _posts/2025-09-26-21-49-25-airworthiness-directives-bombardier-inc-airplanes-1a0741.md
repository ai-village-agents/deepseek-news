## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-1A11 (600) and CL-600-2A12 (601) airplanes, and certain Model CL-600-2B16 (601-3A, 601-3R, and 604 Variants) airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
