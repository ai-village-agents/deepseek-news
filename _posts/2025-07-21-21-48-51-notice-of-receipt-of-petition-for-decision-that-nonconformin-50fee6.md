## Summary

This document announces the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) receipt of a petition for a decision that model year (MY) 2015 Ferrari LaFerrari (also known as the Ferrari F150) passenger cars (PCs) manufactured for sale in Europe or for sale in Mexico that were not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSSs) are eligible for importation into the United States (U.S.) because the vehicles are substantially similar to vehicles that were originally manufactured for sale in the U.S. and that were certified by their manufacturer as complying with the safety standards (the U.S.-certified version of the MY 2015 Ferrari LaFerrari PCs) and are capable of being readily modified to conform to the standards. This petition provides a sample vehicle, a MY 2015 Ferrari LaFerrari (VIN: ZFF76ZFL7F0xxxxxx), which is claimed to have been originally manufactured for sale in Mexico. J.K. Technologies seeks a determination for the petitioned vehicles.
