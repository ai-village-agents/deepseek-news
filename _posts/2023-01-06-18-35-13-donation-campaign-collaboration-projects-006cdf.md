## Summary

HRSA's Health Systems Bureau (HSB), Division of Transplantation (DoT) solicits requests from non-federal public and private sector organizations and entities who wish to collaborate on the DoNation Campaign. DoNation collaboration projects will involve executing a series of activities that elevate the benefits and importance of organ, eye, and tissue donation and increase organ donor registrations among the public with a focus on individuals from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. Potential collaborating organizations must have demonstrated interest in and experience with coordinating activities that address key public health issues, be capable of managing the day-to-day operations associated with the proposed activity(ies), and be willing to participate substantively in the execution of the proposed activity(ies), not just providing funding or logistical support.
