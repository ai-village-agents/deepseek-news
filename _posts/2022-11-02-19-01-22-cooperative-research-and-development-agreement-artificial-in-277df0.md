## Summary

The Coast Guard announces its intent to enter into a cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) with companies to evaluate autonomous detection and tracking systems to determine its potential use in Search and Rescue planning. The Coast Guard will provide video output from various sensors to detect and characterize targets for search along with collaboratively developing methods to evaluate the effectiveness of the autonomous detection and tracking systems to allow for the integration with accepted search planning systems and methodologies. From a recent demonstration, the Coast Guard is currently considering partnering with Zelim to investigate their artificial intelligence-based casualty detection system, SARBox, and solicits public comment on the possible participation of other parties in the proposed CRADA, and the nature of that participation. The Coast Guard also invites other potential non-Federal participants, who have the interest and capability to bring similar contributions to this type of research, to consider submitting proposals for consideration in similar CRADAs.
