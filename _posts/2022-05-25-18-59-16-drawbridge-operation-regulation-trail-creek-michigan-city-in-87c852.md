## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to modify the operating schedule that governs the Amtrak Railroad Bridge, mile 0.9, over Trail Creek, in Michigan City, Indiana, to allow it to operate remotely. The bridge has operated remotely since 2003 without inclusion in the CFR and without incident or public complaint. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
