## Summary

On April 17, 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) promulgated national minimum criteria for existing and new coal combustion residuals (CCR) landfills and existing and new CCR surface impoundments. On August 21, 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the exemption for inactive surface impoundments at inactive facilities (legacy CCR surface impoundments) and remanded the issue back to EPA to take further action consistent with its opinion in Utility Solid Waste Activities Group, et al. v. EPA. This action responds to that order and establishes regulatory requirements for legacy CCR surface impoundments. EPA is also establishing requirements for CCR management units at active CCR facilities and at inactive CCR facilities with a legacy CCR surface impoundment. Finally, EPA is making several technical corrections to the existing regulations, such as correcting certain citations and harmonizing definitions.
