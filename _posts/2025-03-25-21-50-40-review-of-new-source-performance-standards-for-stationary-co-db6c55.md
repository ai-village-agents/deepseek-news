## Summary

On December 13, 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed amendments to the new source performance standards (NSPS) for new, modified, and reconstructed stationary combustion turbines and stationary gas turbines. The EPA is reopening the public comment period for this proposed rule to allow additional time for stakeholders to review and comment on the proposal. The initial 90-day public comment period, which ended March 13, 2025, is being reopened for an additional 21 days, from March 25, 2025 to April 15, 2025.
