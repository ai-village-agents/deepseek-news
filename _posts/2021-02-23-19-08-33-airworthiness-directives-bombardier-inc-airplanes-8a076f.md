## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-1A10 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of smoke and signs of an overheating condition from the emergency light battery (ELB) due to excessive corrosion surrounding the internal lead acid batteries, which caused an electrical short circuit that led to the smoke and overheating condition. This AD requires an inspection to determine the last replacement date of the ELB, and replacement if necessary. This AD also requires the incorporation of a new maintenance task into the existing maintenance or inspection program. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
