## Summary

As part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, FinCEN invites comments on the proposed renewal, without change, of an existing information collection relating to records of certain domestic transactions. Specifically, if the Secretary of the Treasury finds that reasonable grounds exist for concluding that additional recordkeeping and/or reporting requirements are necessary to carry out the purposes of the Bank Secrecy Act, or to prevent evasions thereof, the Secretary may issue an order that imposes certain additional recordkeeping and reporting requirements on one or more domestic financial institutions or nonfinancial trades or businesses in a geographic area. These orders are commonly referred to as geographic targeting orders (GTOs). This request for comments is made pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA).
