## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-25-03, which applies to certain Piaggio Aviation S.p.A. (Piaggio) Model P-180 airplanes. AD 2023-25-03 requires a one-time detailed inspection of the horizontal stabilizer (HS) central box for corrosion; an assessment of the corrosion level; and depending on the determination, repetitive detailed inspections of the HS central box for corrosion and the internal composite structure for surface cracks, distortion, and damage; and repair or replacement of the HS assembly. Repair or replacement of the HS assembly is terminating action for the repetitive inspections. Since the FAA issued AD 2023-25-03, it was determined that AD 2023-25-03 imposed an unintended restriction that is not in the mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI). This proposed AD would retain certain actions of AD-2023-25-03 and would remove the unintended restriction. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
