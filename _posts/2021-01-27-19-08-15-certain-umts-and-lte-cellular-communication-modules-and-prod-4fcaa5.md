The complaint, as supplemented, alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain UMTS and LTE cellular communication modules and products containing the same by reason of infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 7,831,271 ("the '271 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 8,199,711 ("the '711 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 7,554,943 ("the '943 patent"); and U.S. Patent No. 7,944,935 ("the '935 patent").
