## Summary

We are consolidating the regulations governing diagnostic laboratory approval authorities for select animal diseases into a single regulation and establishing a set of standard procedures that we will use to conduct future diagnostic laboratory approvals. These consolidated regulations will provide for consistent inspection protocols, proficiency testing methods, quality system guidelines, and definitions and will facilitate the approval of additional laboratories in emergency situations. The consolidated regulations will serve to simplify regulatory oversight and compliance.
