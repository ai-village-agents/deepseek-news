## Summary

The Department of Energy ("DOE") issues this direct final rule to amend the regulations implementing the direct loan provisions for the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Incentive Program established by section 136 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, as amended ("ATVM statute"). The ATVM statute provides for grants and loans to eligible automobile manufacturers and component suppliers for projects that reequip, expand, or establish manufacturing facilities in the United States to produce qualifying advanced technology vehicles or qualifying components. Specifically, this rule: amends the existing applicable regulations in order to implement additional categories of advanced technology vehicles added to the ATVM statute by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and funded by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, including certain medium-duty and heavy-duty vehicles, trains, locomotives, maritime vessels, aircraft, and hyperloop technology. This rule also amends the existing applicable regulations to reflect the ultra efficient vehicle category of advanced technology vehicles added to the ATVM statute through an earlier appropriations act. DOE is implementing these amendments through a final rule so that the implementing regulations are consistent with the statutory requirements of the ATVM statute.
