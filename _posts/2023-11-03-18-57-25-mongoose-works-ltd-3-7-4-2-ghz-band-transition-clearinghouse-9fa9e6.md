## Summary

In this document, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (Bureau) of the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) grants Mongoose Works, Ltd.'s (Mongoose) Petition for De Novo Review (Petition), and commences a hearing in connection with the 3.7-4.2 GHz Band (C-band) Transition Relocation Payment Clearinghouse's (RPC or clearinghouse) decision which adjusted downward part of Mongoose's reimbursement claim based upon its August 12, 2020 lump sum election. The issues designated for hearing are whether the Bureau erred in determining that Mongoose had not met its burden of proof to demonstrate that the RPC erred in its classification of, and reimbursement for, the two antennas at issue; whether the Bureau erred in separately determining that the RPC properly classified the two antennas at issue based on Commission guidance; and whether the reimbursed amount of $33,994 for the two antennas at issue should be adjusted to restore the disallowed amount of $69,686.
