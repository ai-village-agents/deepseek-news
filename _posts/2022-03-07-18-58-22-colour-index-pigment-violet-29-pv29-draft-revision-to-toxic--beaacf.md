## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the availability of and requesting public comment on a draft revision to the risk determination for the Colour Index Pigment Violet 29 (PV 29) risk evaluation issued under TSCA. The draft revision to the PV 29 risk determination was developed following a review of the first ten risk evaluations issued under TSCA that was done in accordance with Executive Orders and other Administration priorities, including those on environmental justice, scientific integrity, and regulatory review, and this draft revision reflects the announced policy changes to ensure the public is protected from unreasonable risks from chemicals in a way that is supported by science and the law. Specifically, in this draft revision to the risk determination EPA finds that PV 29, as a whole chemical substance, presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health when evaluated under its conditions of use. This draft revision would supersede the condition of use-specific no unreasonable risk determinations in the January 2021 PV 29 risk evaluation (and withdraw the associated order) and make a revised determination of unreasonable risk for PV 29 as a whole chemical substance. In addition, this draft revised risk determination does not reflect an assumption that workers always appropriately wear personal protective equipment (PPE).
