## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-19-03 which applied to Pilatus Aircraft Ltd. (Pilatus) Model PC-12, PC-12/45, PC-12/47, and PC-12/47E airplanes. AD 2022-19-03 required incorporating new revisions to the airworthiness limitation section (ALS) of the existing airplane maintenance manual (AMM) or Instructions for Continued Airworthiness (ICA) to establish a 5-year life limit for certain main landing gear (MLG) actuator bottom attachment bolts and new life limits for the rudder bellcrank. Since the FAA issued AD 2022- 19-03, the FAA determined that new or more restrictive tasks and limitations are necessary. This AD requires revising the ALS of the existing AMM or ICA for your airplane, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference (IBR). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
