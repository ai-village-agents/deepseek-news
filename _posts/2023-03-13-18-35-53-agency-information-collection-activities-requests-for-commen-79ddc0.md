## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on September 23, 2022. The collection involves aeronautical information the FAA uses to carry out agency missions related to flight safety, flight planning, airport engineering and federal grant analysis, airport actions, aeronautical chart and flight information publications, and the promotion of air commerce as required by statute. The information will be used to process airport actions, studies, and analyses and for use when considering funding requests and published in flight information handbooks and charts for pilot use. We have renamed and updated the collection, previously called the FAA Airport Master Record, to incorporate several related tools using this data that are made available and processed via the same online system--the Airport Data and Information Portal (ADIP).
