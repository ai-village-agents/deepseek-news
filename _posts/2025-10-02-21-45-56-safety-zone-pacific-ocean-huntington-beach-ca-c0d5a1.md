## Summary

The U.S. Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone offshore of Huntington Beach, CA, in support of the Pacific Airshow. This safety zone is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters during the airshow and to protect the high concentration of spectators attending the event. This regulation prohibits vessels from entering into, transiting through, or remaining within the safety zone unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port, Los Angeles--Long Beach (COTP), or a designated representative.
