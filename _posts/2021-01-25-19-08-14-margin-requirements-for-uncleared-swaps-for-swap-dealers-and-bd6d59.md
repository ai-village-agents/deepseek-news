## Summary

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("Commission" or "CFTC") is amending the margin requirements for uncleared swaps ("Final Rule") for swap dealers ("SD") and major swap participants ("MSP") for which there is not a prudential regulator ("CFTC Margin Rule"). The Final Rule amends the CFTC Margin Rule to permit the application of a minimum transfer amount ("MTA") of up to $50,000 for each separately managed account ("SMA") of a legal entity that is a counterparty to an SD or MSP in an uncleared swap transaction and to permit the application of separate MTAs for initial margin ("IM") and variation margin ("VM").
