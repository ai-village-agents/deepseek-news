## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing for public comment a draft regulatory guide (DG), DG-1403, "Quality Assurance Program Criteria (Design and Construction)." This DG is proposed Revision 6 of Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.28 of the same name. The proposed revision endorses Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) 14-05A, "Guidelines for the Use of Accreditation in Lieu of Commercial Grade Surveys for Procurement of Laboratory Calibration and Test Services," Revision 1, issued November 2020, as an acceptable approach for licensees and suppliers subject to the quality assurance (QA) requirements of NRC regulations. Also in this proposed revision, the NRC staff endorses the Part I and Part II requirements included in NQA- 1-2017, NQA-1-2019, and NQA-1-2022 for the implementation of a QA program during the design and construction phases of nuclear power plants and fuel reprocessing plants.
