## Summary

This final rule amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regulations to reflect the imposition of import restrictions on certain archaeological and ethnological material from the Kingdom of Morocco (Morocco). These restrictions are being imposed pursuant to an agreement between the Government of the United States and the Government of Morocco that has been entered into under the authority of the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act. The final rule amends the CBP regulations by adding Morocco to the list of countries which have a bilateral agreement with the United States that imposes cultural property import restrictions. The final rule also contains the Designated List that describes the types of archaeological and ethnological material to which the restrictions apply.
