## Summary

NMFS has received a request from the City of Santa Cruz for authorization to take marine mammals incidental to 2 years of construction activities associated with the Murray St. Bridge Seismic Retrofit Project in Santa Cruz, California. Pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), NMFS is requesting comments on its proposal to issue two consecutive 1-year incidental harassment authorizations (IHAs) to incidentally take marine mammals during the specified activities. NMFS is also requesting comments on a possible one-time, 1-year renewal that could be issued under certain circumstances and if all requirements are met, as described in Request for Public Comments at the end of this notice.
