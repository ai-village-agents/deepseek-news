## Summary

NMFS announces that the quotas for the Atlantic surfclam and ocean quahog fisheries for 2020 will remain status quo. NMFS also suspends the minimum size limit for Atlantic surfclams for the 2020 fishing year. Regulations for these fisheries require NMFS to notify the public of the allowable harvest levels for Atlantic surfclams and ocean quahogs from the Exclusive Economic Zone if the previous year's quota specifications remain unchanged.
