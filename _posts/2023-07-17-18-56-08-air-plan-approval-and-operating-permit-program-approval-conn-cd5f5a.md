## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revised definition in the State Implementation Plan (SIP) and the Title V Operating Permit Program for the State of Connecticut. On June 9, 2023, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CT DEEP) submitted to EPA a request to parallel process recently proposed revisions to the state's definition of "severe non- attainment area for ozone" for inclusion in the EPA-approved SIP and Title V Operating Permit Program. The revision is necessary to fully implement these programs based on a nonattainment reclassification to a portion of Connecticut for the 2008 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard. EPA is approving these revisions pursuant to the CAA and implementing federal regulations.
