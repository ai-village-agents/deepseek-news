## Summary

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is proposing a data collection activity as part of the 2024 National Survey of Early Care and Education (NSECE) to be conducted October 2023 through July 2024. The objective of the 2024 NSECE is to document the nation's use and availability of early care and education (ECE) services, building on the information collected in 2012 and 2019 to describe the ECE landscape in the U.S. The 2024 NSECE will collect information on families with children under age 13 years, on ECE providers that serve families with children from birth to 13 years in the U.S., and on the workforce providing these services.
