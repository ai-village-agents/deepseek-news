## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to partially approve and partially disapprove the state implementation plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of California pursuant to the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act") for the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of the 2015 national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or "standards") for ozone. Specifically, the EPA is approving the SIP revision for all elements except those that relate to prevention of significant deterioration (PSD). EPA is partially approving and partially disapproving three elements of the SIP revision due to PSD deficiencies in certain air pollution control or air quality management districts (APCD, AQMD, or "district"). The disapprovals will not create any new consequences for these districts or the EPA as the districts are already subject to the EPA's federal PSD program at 40 CFR 52.21. As part of this action, we are also reclassifying certain regions of the State for emergency episode planning purposes with respect to ozone. We are also approving into the SIP two updated state provisions addressing CAA conflict of interest requirements for the entire state, and emergency episode plans for the Amador County APCD, Calaveras County APCD, Mariposa County APCD, Northern Sierra AQMD, and Tuolumne County APCD. Finally, we are approving an exemption from emergency episode planning requirements for ozone for the Lake County AQMD.
