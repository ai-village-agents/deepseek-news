## Summary

This Order cancels and replaces the November 7, 2025, Emergency Order Establishing Operating Limitations on the Use of Navigable Airspace (November 7 Emergency Order) reducing and temporarily prohibiting certain operations in the navigable airspace to ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficiency of the National Airspace System (NAS). This Order modifies the requirement of the November 7 Emergency Order to reduce operations at certain airports by 10 percent, by reducing the required reduction in operations to 6 percent. Accordingly, to maintain the highest standards of safety in the NAS, certain air carriers will be required to reduce their total daily scheduled domestic operations between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. local at certain airports by 6 percent, subject to the provisions set forth in this Order. This Order retains other restrictions in NAS operations and reductions in available Air Traffic Organization services contained in the November 7 Emergency Order.
