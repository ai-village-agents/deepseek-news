## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) continues its long-standing practice of reviewing its licensing rules and practices in light of innovation and development in the satellite industry and seeks further comment on possible further streamlining and expediting of its rules. Proposals include: elimination of the procedural requirement to print and maintain a paper copy of a license; changing the default status of space and earth station proceedings to permit-but-disclose; allowing earth station operators to apply for and receive a limited license without an identified satellite point of communication. The Commission also seeks comment on: additional minor modifications to be made by operators without prior authorization from the Commission; whether to provide a process for market access petitioners to seek the equivalent of a special temporary authorization (STA); whether to expand the window for operators to file renewal applications for existing licenses; further streamlining some of its coordination requirements for earth and space station operators; expanding the conditions under which earth station operators could access the new, streamlined "deemed-granted" process for adding points of communications; timeframes for taking action on license applications; allowing operators to file STA extensions concurrently with an STA application; and on the creation of a permitted list that would include NGSO operators.
