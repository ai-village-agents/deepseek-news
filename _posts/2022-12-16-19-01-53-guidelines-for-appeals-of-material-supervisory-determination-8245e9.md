## Summary

On December 13, 2022, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation adopted revised Guidelines for Appeals of Material Supervisory Determinations (Guidelines). The revisions expand and clarify the role of the agency's Ombudsman, adding the Ombudsman to the Supervision Appeals Review Committee as a non-voting member, and require that materials considered by the Supervision Appeals Review Committee be shared with both parties to the appeal on a timely basis, subject to applicable legal limitations on disclosure. In addition, the revised Guidelines allow insured depository institutions to request a stay of a material supervisory determination while an appeal is pending.
