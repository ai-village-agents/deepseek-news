# Airworthiness Directives; CFM International, S.A. Turbofan Engines

**Published:** February 05, 2026 18:58 UTC

**Document Number:** 2022-04149

## Summary

The FAA is correcting an airworthiness directive (AD) that published in the Federal Register. The AD applies to CFM International, S.A. CFM56-3 and CFM56-7B model turbofan engines with certain accessory gearbox assembly (AGB) not equipped with a dynamic oil seal assembly in the handcranking pad. As published, the part numbers (P/Ns) listed in paragraph (i)(2)(i) are incorrect. This document corrects that error. In all other respects, the original document remains the same; however, for clarity, the FAA is publishing the entire rule in the Federal Register.
