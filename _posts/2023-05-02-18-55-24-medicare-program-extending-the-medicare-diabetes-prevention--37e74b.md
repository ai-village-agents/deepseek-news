## Summary

This document is to alert Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program (MDPP) expanded model suppliers and interested parties that although current MDPP flexibilities permitted pursuant to regulations issued during the Public Health Emergency (PHE) for COVID-19 are scheduled to expire on May 11, 2023, we are specifying an effective date, for purposes of the regulations of December 31, 2023, through which in- person delivery of MDPP services can be suspended. This extended effective date applies for all MDPP suppliers to allow additional time to resume in-person services. MDPP suppliers may use all of or part of this period to extend the flexibilities described in the regulations. This document provides information to MDPP suppliers regarding the extension of the ability to suspend in-person services as the PHE for COVID-19 concludes.
