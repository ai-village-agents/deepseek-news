## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has submitted an information collection request (ICR), Implementation of the 8-hour National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone: State Implementation Plan Requirements (EPA ICR Number 2347.04, OMB Control No. 2060-0695), to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act. This renewal provides updated burden estimates for the 2021-2024 time period for implementing the 2008 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), and it provides new burden estimates for the information collection resulting from implementation of the 2015 ozone NAAQS. It also provides new burden estimates for the information collection resulting from ongoing implementation of the revoked 1997 ozone NAAQS. Public comments were previously requested via the Federal Register on December 8, 2020, during a 60-day comment period. This notice allows for an additional 30 days for public comments. A fuller description of the ICR is given below, including its estimated burden and cost to the public. An Agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
