## Summary

The Department of State proposes an adjustment to the Schedule of Fees for Consular Services (Schedule of Fees) of the Bureau of Consular Affairs (CA) based on the findings of the most recently approved update to the Cost of Service Model (CoSM). The CoSM is updated annually using a combination of costs, predicted workload, and level of effort data. The proposed adjustment will result in a more accurate alignment of the fees for consular services to the costs of providing those services. The notice proposes an increased amount for the passport security surcharge, from $60 to $80, which the Department will retain.
