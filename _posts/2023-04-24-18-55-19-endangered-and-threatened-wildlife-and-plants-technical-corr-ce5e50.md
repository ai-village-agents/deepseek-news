## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are withdrawing, in part, a February 2, 2023, direct final rule that revises the taxonomy of 62 wildlife and plant species listed under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). For the Hawaiian hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus semotus), we received comments relating to scientific research relevant to its taxonomic classification; and as a result, we are withdrawing the amendment in the direct final rule for this species only. The amendments in the direct final rule for the other 61 wildlife and plant species will be effective on May 3, 2023.
