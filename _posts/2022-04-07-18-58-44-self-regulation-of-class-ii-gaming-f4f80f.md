## Summary

The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) proposes to amend its regulations regarding self-regulation of Class II gaming under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. The proposed rule will amend the regulations to address an ambiguity in the petitioning process and clarify and expand the Office of Self-Regulation's (OSR) role once the Commission issues a certificate. Notably, the proposed rule: Clarifies the NIGC may issue a final decision on issuing a certificate within 30 days instead of after 30 days; enumerates the OSR is the correct party to receive notifications of material changes from self-regulated tribes; clarifies the OSR will be the proponent of any case to revoke a certificate of self-regulation before the Commission; enables the OSR to obtain information from a self-regulated tribe; and clarifies that, in any revocation proceeding, the OSR has the burden to show just cause for the revocation and carry that burden by a preponderance of the evidence.
