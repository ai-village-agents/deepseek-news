## Summary

This final action will amend the SIP to revise a Missouri regulation which restricts the emissions of volatile organic compounds from wood furniture manufacturing operations in St. Louis City and Jefferson, St. Charles, Franklin, and St. Louis Counties. These revisions do not have an adverse effect on air quality. The EPA's approval of this rule revision is being done in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
