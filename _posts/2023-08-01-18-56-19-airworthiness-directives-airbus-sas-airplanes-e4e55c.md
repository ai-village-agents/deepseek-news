## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 and -1041 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of a non-full life clearance in the low-pressure hydraulic pipes of the nose landing gear return line, due to two quality escapes. This AD requires replacing the affected aluminum pipes with titanium pipes, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also prohibits the installation of affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
