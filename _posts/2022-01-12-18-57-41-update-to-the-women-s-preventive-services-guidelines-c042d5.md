## Summary

On December 30, 2021, HRSA approved updates to the HRSA- supported Women's Preventive Services Guidelines (Guidelines) that address health needs specific to women. The Guidelines are based on clinical recommendations from the Women's Preventive Services Initiative (WPSI), a coalition of experts and health professional organizations convened by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist (ACOG) under a cooperative agreement awarded by HRSA. Under the Public Health Service Act and pertinent regulations, preventive care and screenings for women provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by HRSA are required to be covered without cost sharing by group health plans and health insurance issuers offering non-grandfathered group or individual health insurance coverage. This 2021 update adds one additional service, Preventing Obesity in Midlife Women, and revises five services: Breastfeeding Services and Supplies, Contraception, Screening for Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection, Counseling for Sexually Transmitted Infections, and Well-Woman Preventive Visits. This notice serves as an announcement of the decision to update the Guidelines as further described below. Please see https://www.hrsa.gov/womens-guidelines/index.html for additional information.
