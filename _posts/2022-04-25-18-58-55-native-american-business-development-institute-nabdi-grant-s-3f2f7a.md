## Summary

The Office of Indian Energy and Economic Development (OIED), through its Native American Business Development Institute (NABDI), is soliciting grant proposals from eligible federally recognized Tribes and Tribal organizations. NABDI award funding will be used to explore economic development opportunities through feasibility studies and business plans. Feasibility studies may concern the viability of an economic development project or business, or the practicality of a technology, that a Tribe may choose to pursue to explore how a current Tribal business or enterprises could recover from and adapt to the challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Business plans may concern goals for economic opportunity and recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
