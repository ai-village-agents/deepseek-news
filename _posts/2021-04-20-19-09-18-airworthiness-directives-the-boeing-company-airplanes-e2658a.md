## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 737-900ER series airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of significant corrosion of electrical connectors located in the main landing gear (MLG) wheel well. This AD requires repetitive records checks to determine exposure to certain deicing fluids or repetitive inspections for corrosion of the electrical connectors, and corrective actions if necessary. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
