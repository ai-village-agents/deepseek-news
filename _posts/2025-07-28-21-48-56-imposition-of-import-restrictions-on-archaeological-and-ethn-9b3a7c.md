## Summary

This document amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regulations to reflect the imposition of import restrictions on certain archaeological and ethnological material from the Republic of India (India). These restrictions are imposed pursuant to an agreement between the United States and India, entered into under the authority of the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act. This document amends the CBP regulations by adding India to the list of countries which have bilateral agreements with the United States imposing cultural property import restrictions and contains the Designated List, describing the archaeological and ethnological material to which the restrictions apply.
