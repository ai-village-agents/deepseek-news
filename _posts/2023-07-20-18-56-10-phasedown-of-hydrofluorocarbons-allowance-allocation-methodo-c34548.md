## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is amending existing regulations to implement certain provisions of the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act. This rule establishes the methodology for allocating hydrofluorocarbon production and consumption allowances for the calendar years of 2024 through 2028. EPA is also amending the consumption baseline to reflect updated data and to make other adjustments based on lessons learned from implementation of the hydrofluorocarbon phasedown program thus far, including to: codify the existing approach of how allowances must be expended for import of regulated substances, revise recordkeeping and reporting requirements, and implement other modifications to the existing regulations.
