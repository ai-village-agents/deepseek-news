(Yinfeng/Mangrove), Fujian Jinquan Trade Co., Ltd./Fujian Province Youxi County Baiyuan Wood Machining Co., Ltd. (Jinquan/Baiyuan) and 29 non-individually examined exporters of wood mouldings and millworks products (WMMP) from the People's Republic of China (China) did not sell subject merchandise to the United States at prices below normal value (NV) during the period of review (POR), August 12, 2020, through January 31, 2022. Commerce further determines that Fujian Shunchang Shengsheng Wood Industry Limited Company (Shunchang Shengsheng), Xiamen Jinxi Building Material Co., Ltd. (Xiamen Jinxi), and Zhangzhou Green Wood Industry and Trade Co., Ltd. (Greenwood) made no shipments of subject merchandise during the POR and that Gaomi Hongtai Home Furniture Co., Ltd. has not established eligibility for a separate rate and, therefore, is part of the China- wide entity. Additionally, we are rescinding this administrative review with respect to three companies that are not eligible for review because they either had no reviewable entries during the POR or are U.S. resellers.
