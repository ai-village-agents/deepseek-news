## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), in consultation with the U.S. Department of Transportation, is proposing to amend its regulations for the packaging and transportation of radioactive material. The NRC has historically revised its transportation safety regulations to ensure harmonization with the International Atomic Energy Agency standards. These changes are necessary to maintain a consistent regulatory framework with the U.S. Department of Transportation for the domestic packaging and transportation of radioactive material and to ensure general accord with International Atomic Energy Agency standards. Concurrently, the NRC is issuing for public comment Draft Regulatory Guide DG-7011, which would become Revision 3 to Regulatory Guide 7.9, "Standard Format and Content of Part 71 Applications for Approval of Packages for Radioactive Material."
