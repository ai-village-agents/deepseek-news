## Summary

The NMFS Assistant Administrator (Assistant Administrator) has issued a new 5-year affirmative finding for the Government of Peru under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). This affirmative finding will allow the importation into the United States of yellowfin tuna and yellowfin tuna products harvested in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (ETP), in compliance with the Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Program (AIDCP), by purse seine vessels operating under Peru's jurisdiction or exported from Peru. NMFS bases the affirmative finding determination on reviews of documentary evidence submitted by the Government of Peru and of information obtained from the Inter- American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC).
