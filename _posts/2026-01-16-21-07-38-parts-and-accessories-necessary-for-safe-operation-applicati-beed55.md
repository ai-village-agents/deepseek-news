## Summary

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) requests public comment on an application from Charles Machine Works, Inc. (CMW), a wholly owned subsidiary of The Toro Company, seeking renewal of a 5-year exemption from the Agency's prohibition against the use of gravity-fed or siphon-fed fuel systems on commercial motor vehicles (CMVs). The exemption would allow CMW's CMVs equipped with certain auxiliary equipment to use gravity-fed or siphon-fed fuel systems when the auxiliary equipment is operated only while the CMV is stationary. FMCSA requests public comment on CMW's application for renewal of this exemption.
