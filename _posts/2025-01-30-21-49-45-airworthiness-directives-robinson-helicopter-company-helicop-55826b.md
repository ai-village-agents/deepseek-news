## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2024-19-11, which applies to all Robinson Helicopter Company Model R44 and R44 II helicopters. AD 2024-19-11 requires visually inspecting a certain flex plate assembly (flex plate) and certain clutch shaft forward yokes (yokes), including each flex plate bolt, and depending on the results, taking corrective actions. AD 2024-19-11 also requires removing certain yokes from service within a specified threshold, or as an alternative, performing in-depth inspections. Since the FAA issued AD 2024-19-11, it has been determined that clarifications regarding the alternative inspections are necessary. This proposed AD would retain all the requirements of AD 2024-19-11 and would clarify that the alternative inspections are repetitive and add a particular paint remover option to use when performing those alternative inspections. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
