## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model MD-11, MD-11F, and 717-200 airplanes, all Model 737-8 and 737-9 airplanes, all Model 737-600, -700, -700C, - 800, -900, and -900ER series airplanes, certain Model 747-400 and 747- 400F series airplanes, certain Model 757 and 767 airplanes, and all Model 777 airplanes. This AD requires revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to include a limitation to prohibit operations that require less than 0.3 required navigational performance (RNP) within a specified area for airplanes having a certain multi-mode receiver (MMR) with certain software installed. This AD was prompted by reports of the loss of global positioning system (GPS) data or degraded GPS positional accuracy while using a certain MMR. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
