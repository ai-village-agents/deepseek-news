## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to change the existing Port of Miami fixed security zone regulation that encompasses certain navigable waters of the Miami Main Channel in Miami, FL. The proposed change is designed to extend the existing security zone eastward. The extension is needed to include future cruise ship terminals at the Port of Miami. This proposed action would extend the existing fixed security zone approximately 840 yards eastward along the Miami Main Channel. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
