## Summary

NEH intends to award $491,049 to the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition (NABS) for continued survey work and prioritization of primary sources documenting the history of Indian boarding schools in the U.S.; digitization and description of 120,000 pages of federal boarding school records held by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA); and collaboration among source communities, the National Indian Boarding School Digital Archive Data Aggregation Working Group, the Social Networks and Archival Context cooperative, and federal partners. This action is necessary to further the development of digital access to records significant to public understanding of the history and impacts of Indian boarding schools in the U.S. Because NABS has invested four years into developing a unique platform with the technical considerations to aggregate boarding school records of various sizes and formats and leads an established community of practice creating standards and best practices in boarding school record curation, NEH determined that a competition to fund the construction of a similar platform and capacities would be uneconomical and impractical.
