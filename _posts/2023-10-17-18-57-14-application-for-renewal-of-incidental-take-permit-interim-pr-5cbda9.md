## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce receipt of an application from the County of Santa Cruz (applicant) for renewal of an existing incidental take permit under the Endangered Species Act. The applicant has requested a renewal that will extend permit duration by 20 years from the date the permit is reissued. The permit would continue to authorize take of the federally endangered Mount Hermon June beetle that is incidental to otherwise lawful activities associated with the approved Interim Programmatic Habitat Conservation Plan for the Endangered Mount Hermon June Beetle and Ben Lomond Spineflower. We invite comment on the application and associated documents from agencies, Tribes, and the public.
