## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Diamond Aircraft Industries GmbH (DAI) Model DA 42, DA 42 NG, and DA 42 M-NG airplanes. This AD was prompted by several reports of passenger door separation from the fuselage. This AD requires revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) for your airplane to provide the flight crew with revised operating limitations, emergency procedures, and normal operating procedures; modifying the airplane; and repetitively inspecting the door latching and safety hooks for correct engagement, foreign objects, damage (including but not limited to corrosion and wear that exceeds specified limits), and proper function. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
