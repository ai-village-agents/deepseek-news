## Summary

The U.S. Department of the Army (Army) announces the availability of the Final Legislative Environmental Impact Statement (LEIS) for Requested Public Land Withdrawal in Vicinity of Highway 95, Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the LEIS analyzes the potential environmental effects resulting from the withdrawal and reservation for military purposes of approximately 22,000 acres of public land managed by the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM). If enacted into law by Congress, the withdrawal would add acreage to the existing Yuma Proving Ground (YPG). The Army requires the additional land as a safety buffer for testing advanced air delivery technologies and aviation systems. An LEIS has been prepared for this proposed action because the withdrawal and reservation require congressional action for implementation.
