## Summary

On or about March 4, 2022, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is making available to the public, Volumes 1 and 2 of the Integrated Review Plan for the Lead National Ambient Air Quality Standards (IRP). The national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for lead (Pb) are set to protect the public health and the public welfare from Pb in ambient air. Volume 1 of the IRP contains contextual background material and the anticipated schedule for the current review of the air quality criteria and NAAQS for Pb. Volume 2 identifies policy-relevant issues in the review and describes key considerations in EPA's development of the Integrated Science Assessment (ISA). The ISA provides the scientific basis for the EPA's decisions, in conjunction with additional technical and policy assessments, for the review of the NAAQS, as described in the Clean Air Act, section 108(a).
