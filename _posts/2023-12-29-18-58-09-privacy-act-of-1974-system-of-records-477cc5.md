## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission or Agency) has modified an existing system of records, FCC/OMD-18, Telephone Call Details, subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. This action is necessary to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act to publish in the Federal Register notice of the existence and character of records maintained by the agency. The FCC's Office of the Managing Director (OMD) will use a vendor-provided management solution to maintain information associated with the FCC's wireless communications equipment, functions, and services. This modification makes various necessary changes and updates, including formatting changes required by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-108 since its previous publication, and the revision of existing routine uses.
