## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for a renewal of information collection. The FAA must continue collecting information about requests for waivers from certain operational rules that apply to small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS). The FAA will continue to use the collected information to make determinations whether to authorize or deny the requested operations of sUAS. The information collected is necessary to issue such authorizations or denials consistent with the FAA's mandate to ensure safe and efficient use of national airspace.
