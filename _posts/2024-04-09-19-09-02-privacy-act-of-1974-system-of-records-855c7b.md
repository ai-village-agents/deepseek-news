## Summary

The National Labor Relations Board ("NLRB" or "Agency"), as part of publishing a notice of a modified Privacy Act system of records for the NxGen system and the rescindment of legacy systems of records, is removing exemptions for eight of those legacy systems of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. This rule is being published as a direct final rule as the Agency does not expect to receive any significant adverse comments. If such comments are received, this direct final rule will be withdrawn and a proposed rule for comments will be published.
