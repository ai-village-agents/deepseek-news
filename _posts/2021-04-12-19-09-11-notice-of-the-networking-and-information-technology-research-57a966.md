## Summary

The NITRD Advanced Wireless Test Platform (AWTP) Team and Federal Mobility Group (FMG) Joint 5G Workshop will consist of two half-day sessions with a focus on advancing the FMG work product-- Framework to Conduct 5G Testing--by exploring its applicability to specific 5G inspired use cases. It will provide moderated exercises where participants will walk through the process identified in the framework document, with two selected Federal 5G use cases. The goal is to provide an overview of the process and the testing framework elements needed to conduct 5G testing for different use cases. It will also allow participants to learn about Federal 5G use cases and requirements from key stakeholders. The intended outcomes of this workshop are to build awareness of the critical need for evolving 5G best-in-class test practices, and to connect 5G labs or testbeds with Federal agencies and 5G component vendors.
