## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2015-26- 01, which applied to certain Airbus Helicopters Model AS332C1, AS332L1, AS332L2, EC225LP, AS-365N2, AS 365 N3, EC 155B, and EC155B1 helicopters with an energy-absorbing seat. AD 2015-26-01 required inspecting for the presence of labels (placards) that prohibit stowing anything under the seat, and if a label (placard) is missing or not clearly visible to each occupant, installing a label (placard). This AD retains all of the requirements of AD 2015-26-01, and also adds helicopters to the applicability and requires a modification (installing new labels (placards)). This AD was prompted by the determination that additional helicopters are affected by the unsafe condition, and that new labels (placards) are required for all affected helicopters. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
