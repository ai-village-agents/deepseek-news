# West Virginia Regulatory Program; Correction

**Published:** February 04, 2026 21:49 UTC

## Summary

We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), published a document in the Federal Register on March 18, 2024, approving in part, and not approving in part, amendments to the West Virginia regulatory program (the West Virginia program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). We made an error in the document by overwriting a provision that should not have been removed; instead, we should have added a new paragraph under the not approved section. Additionally, we did not include a provision in the table where our approvals were listed. We published a correction to the March 18, 2024, Federal Register document on August 28, 2024, but because the March 18 revisions had already become effective, the amendatory instructions became erroneous and the August 28, 2024, corrections could not be incorporated into the Code of Federal Regulations. This document corrects the final regulations.
