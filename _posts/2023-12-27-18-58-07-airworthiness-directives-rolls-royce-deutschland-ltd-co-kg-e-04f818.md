## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-25-04 for certain Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Model Trent 1000 engines. AD 2021-25-04 required operators to revise the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of their existing approved continuous airworthiness maintenance program by incorporating the revised tasks of the applicable time limits manual (TLM) for each affected model turbofan engine. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-05-04, the manufacturer revised the TLM to introduce new or more restrictive tasks and limitations and associated thresholds and intervals for life-limited parts, which prompted this AD. This AD requires revising the ALS of the operator's existing approved engine maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive tasks and limitations and associated thresholds and intervals for life-limited parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
