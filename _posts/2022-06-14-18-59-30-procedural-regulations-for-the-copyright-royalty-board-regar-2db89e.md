## Summary

On July 8, 2019, the Copyright Royalty Judges revised their regulations to move several sections from one part to a new part. At the time, the Judges inadvertently failed to revise other regulations that include cross-references to the old part. They are now revising regulations regarding the filing of claims to reflect the change.
