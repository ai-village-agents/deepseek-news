## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing a Confirmatory Order to Ms. Shannon Gray, an employee of Avera McKennan Hospital, to document commitments made as part of a settlement agreement made between the NRC and Ms. Gray following an alternative dispute resolution mediation session held on April 19, 2022. The mediation addressed an apparent violation involving deliberate misconduct which caused Avera McKennan to be in violation of NRC requirements. Ms. Gray has implemented various corrective actions to identify the problem and restore compliance at Avera McKennan. Further, Ms. Gray has committed to developing training on the events which led to the violation and lessons learned from the issue. Ms. Gray will present the training to Avera McKennan staff and to additional outside hospital staff involved in nuclear medicine. The Confirmatory Order is effective upon issuance.
