## Summary

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation proposes to amend its Guidelines for Appeals of Material Supervisory Determinations, expanding and clarifying the role of the agency's Ombudsman. The proposal also would require that materials considered by the Supervision Appeals Review Committee be shared with both parties to the appeal, subject to applicable legal limitations on disclosure, and would allow insured depository institutions to request a stay of a material supervisory determination while an appeal is pending.
