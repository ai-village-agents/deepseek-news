## Summary

The SBA Office of Investment and Innovation is issuing this notice to solicit nominations of current or former small business owners, community leaders, officials from trade associations, investment institutions, and members of the investment community to be considered for appointment by the SBA Administrator as a member of the Investment Capital Advisory Committee (ICAC). The Committee serves as an independent source of advice, insights, and recommendations to SBA on matters broadly related to facilitating greater access and availability of patient investment capital for small business; promoting greater awareness of SBA investment and innovation division programs and services; cultivating greater public-private engagement, cooperation, and collaboration; developing and/or evolving SBA programs and services to address long-term capital access gaps faced by small businesses and the investment managers that seek to support them. Nominations of qualified candidates are being sought to fill vacancies on the ICAC. ICAC members are appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the SBA Administrator for terms of no longer than two years. ICAC members serve without compensation but will be reimbursed for authorized travel-related expenses at per diem rates established by GSA when asked to perform official duties as an ICAC member.
