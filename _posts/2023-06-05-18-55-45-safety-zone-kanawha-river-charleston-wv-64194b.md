## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone June 30, 2023, through July 4, 2023, on the Kanawha River, Charleston, WV, for events associated with the Charleston Sternwheel Regatta. The safety zone will cover all navigable waters between mile marker 58 and 59. This action is necessary to protect regatta participants, the public, and the marine environment from potential hazards created by a regatta, as well as fireworks. This rulemaking prohibits persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Ohio Valley or a designated representative.
