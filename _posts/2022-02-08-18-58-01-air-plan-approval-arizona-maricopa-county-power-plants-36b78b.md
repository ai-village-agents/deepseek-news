## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the Maricopa County Air Quality Department's (MCAQD or County) portion of the Arizona State Implementation Plan (SIP). This revision concerns emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) and particulate matter (PM) from power plants. We are proposing to approve a local rule to regulate these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act). We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action. Elsewhere in this Federal Register, we are making an interim final determination to defer CAA sanctions associated with our previous disapproval action concerning the County's revision of this local rule.
