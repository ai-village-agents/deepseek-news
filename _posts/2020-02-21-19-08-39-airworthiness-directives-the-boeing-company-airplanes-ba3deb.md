## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for The Boeing Company Model 737 series airplanes, except for Model 737-100, - 200, -200C, -300, -400, and -500 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of separation of the lower aft wing-to-body fairing panel 194E ("fairing panel 194E") during flight, due to worn or damaged nutplates on the support structure. This AD requires repetitive inspections for discrepancies of fairing panel 194E, wheel well panel 193D, and support structure, and related investigative and corrective actions if necessary. This AD also requires rework of the panels and support structure, which terminates the repetitive inspections. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
