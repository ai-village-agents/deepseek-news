## Summary

The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is correcting a final rule that was published in the Federal Register on January 12, 2022, amending its Rules of Practice and Procedure and other agency regulations to adjust each civil money penalty within its jurisdiction to account for inflation, pursuant to the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, as amended by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015. In that publication, the Regulatory Identification Number (RIN) for the FHFA was incorrect. This document corrects that error.
