## Summary

On December 19, 2016, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published an interim final rule (2016 interim rule) amending its regulations governing the requirements and procedures for victims of a severe form of trafficking in persons seeking T nonimmigrant status. The 2016 interim rule amended the regulations to conform with legislation enacted after the publication of the initial regulations and to codify discretionary changes based on DHS's experience implementing the T nonimmigrant status program since it was established in 2002. DHS is adopting the 2016 interim rule as final with several clarifying changes based on USCIS experience implementing the interim rule, in response to comments received, and due to an organizational change to move the regulations to a separate subpart as explained in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section below. This final rule is intended to respond to public comments and clarify the eligibility and application requirements so that they conform to current law.
