## Summary

The Bureau of Industry and Security is amending the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by adding two entities under seven entries to the Entity List. These entities are listed under the destinations of Canada (1), the People's Republic of China (China) (1), India (1), Japan (1), Malaysia (1), Sweden (1), and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) (1). Some entities are added under multiple entries, accounting for the difference in the totals. This final rule also modifies two existing entries on the Entity List under the destination of China. This final rule removes one entity under the destination of the UAE.
