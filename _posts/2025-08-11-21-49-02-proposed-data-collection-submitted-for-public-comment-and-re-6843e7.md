The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies to take this opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Laboratory Response Network. This collection will allow CDC to continue to track laboratory testing capacity, capability, and distribution to ensure all areas of the nation are protected during a public health emergency response.
