Although new to the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense organization, the 263rd Army Air and Missile Defense Command has a long history. Headquartered in Anderson, South Carolina, the 263rd AAMDC was established in 2000 when the 263rd Air Defense Artillery was reflagged. Its origins, however, predate the founding of our nation.
