## Summary

The Federal Railroad Administration is seeking information on potential uses and options for disposal or repurposing used creosote- treated railroad ties (CTRTs), which are the wooden rail crossties that support the rail track. Every year, approximately 23 million CTRTs are replaced along the nation's rail network. Because a number of FRA's grant programs fund rail infrastructure projects, which may include the replacement of worn CTRTs, understanding the options to dispose of CTRTs will assist FRA and its grantees from the implementation of FRA's grant programs and assessing the impacts of such disposition (e.g., life-cycle maintenance impacts). Depending on the responses, FRA may develop a best practices document for rail tie disposal.
