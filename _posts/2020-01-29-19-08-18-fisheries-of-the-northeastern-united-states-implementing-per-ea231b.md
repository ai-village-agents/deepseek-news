## Summary

NMFS proposes regulations to implement permitting and reporting measures for private recreational tilefish vessels that were approved in Amendment 6 to the Tilefish Fishery Management Plan. These measures are being implemented after the other management measures in Amendment 6 because of additional time needed for development. The intended effect of this action is to notify private recreation tilefish vessels of the proposed changes and to solicit public comment on these measures.
