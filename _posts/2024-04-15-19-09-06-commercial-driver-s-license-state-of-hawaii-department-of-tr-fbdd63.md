## Summary

FMCSA announces the Hawaii Department of Transportation's (HDOT) requests for an exemption on behalf of the Hawaii Department of Education's (DOE) Transportation Services Branch and independent schools statewide to allow Class A or B commercial driver's license (CDL) holders with a passenger (P) endorsement to operate a school bus without holding a school bus (S) endorsement, and to allow the use of motorcoaches and vans to transport students to/from a central location to school daily. HDOT states that except for the S endorsement training requirements, all other Federal and State training requirements will be completed before drivers start transporting students in motorcoaches. HDOT believes an exemption will provide a temporary resolution to its school bus driver shortage while drivers complete the S endorsement training. FMCSA requests public comment on the applicant's request for exemption.
