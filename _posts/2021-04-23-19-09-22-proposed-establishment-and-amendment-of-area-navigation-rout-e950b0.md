# Proposed Establishment and Amendment of Area Navigation Routes, Northeast Corridor Atlantic Coast Routes; Northeastern United States

**Published:** February 05, 2026 19:09 UTC

## Summary

This action proposes to modify three existing high altitude area navigation (RNAV) routes (Q-routes), and establish one new Q- route, in support of the Northeast Corridor Atlantic Coast Route (NEC ACR) Project. This proposal would improve the efficiency of the National Airspace System (NAS) by expanding the availability of RNAV routing and reducing the dependency on ground-based navigational systems.
