## Summary

The Department of Energy (DOE or Department) proposes to revise its regulations regarding records maintained on individuals under the Privacy Act. The revisions would clarify and update procedural requirements pertaining to the inclusion of a Social Security Number (SSN) on documents that the Department sends by mail. These revisions are necessary to implement the SSN Fraud Prevention Act of 2017's restriction on the inclusion of SSNs on documents sent by mail by the Federal Government. Additionally, the Department proposes to maintain a publicly available list authorizing certain designated documents to include SSNs if: inclusion is necessary; and the documents are requested by individuals outside DOE or other Federal agencies. This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) seeks comment on this proposal.
