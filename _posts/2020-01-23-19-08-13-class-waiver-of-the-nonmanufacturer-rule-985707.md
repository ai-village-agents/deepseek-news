## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is considering granting a request for a class waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule (NMR) for leather holsters (M18 System) and accessories. According to the request, no small business manufacturers can manufacture and supply a specific proprietary holster system to the Federal government. If granted, the class waiver would allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the waived item(s), regardless of the business size of the manufacturer, on a Federal contract set aside for small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), women-owned small business (WOSB), economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB), historically underutilized business zones (HUBZone), or participants in the SBA's 8(a) Business Development (BD) program.
