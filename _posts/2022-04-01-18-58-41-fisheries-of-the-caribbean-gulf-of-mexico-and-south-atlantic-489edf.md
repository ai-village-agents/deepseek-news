## Summary

NMFS issues regulations to implement Amendment 10 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Dolphin and Wahoo Fishery of the Atlantic (Dolphin and Wahoo FMP), as prepared and submitted by the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council). This final rule revises the annual catch limits (ACLs), accountability measures (AMs), and additional management measures for dolphin and wahoo. The additional management measures address commercial trip limits, authorized fishing gear, the operator permit (card) requirement for dolphin and wahoo, and the recreational vessel limit for dolphin. Amendment 10 also revises the acceptable biological catch (ABC) and sector allocations for both dolphin and wahoo. The purpose of this final rule and Amendment 10 is to base conservation and management measures for dolphin and wahoo on the best scientific information available and increase net benefits to the fishery.
