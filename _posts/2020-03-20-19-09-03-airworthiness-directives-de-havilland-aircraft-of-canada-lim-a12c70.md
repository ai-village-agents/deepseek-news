## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2015-14-01, which applies to certain Bombardier, Inc., Model DHC-8-400 series airplanes. AD 2015-14-01 requires a detailed inspection for loose bolts on the aft translating door crank assembly, and removal and reinstallation of the bolts. Since AD 2015-14-01 was issued, the FAA received a report that additional airplanes may be subject to the unsafe condition. In addition, the design of the translating door crank handle has been improved. This proposed AD would retain the inspections of AD 2015-14-01 and add airplanes to the applicability. For all airplanes, this proposed AD would also require a modification of the door crank handle, which would terminate the inspections. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
