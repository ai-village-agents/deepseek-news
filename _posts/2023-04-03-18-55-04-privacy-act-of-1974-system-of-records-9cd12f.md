The Emergency Notification System (ENS) provides a notification system for the Department's internal Continuity of Operations (COOP) and Pandemic plans, as well as day-to-day emergency management efforts. ENS provides real-time notifications to Department employees during an emergency event. ENS also gives Department employees the ability to access and modify their own personal information and preferences via a self-service portal, and system administrators the ability to generate reports to verify the status of the aforementioned emergency alerts.
