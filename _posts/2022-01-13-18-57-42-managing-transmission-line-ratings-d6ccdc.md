## Summary

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is revising both the pro forma Open Access Transmission Tariff and the Commission's regulations under the Federal Power Act to improve the accuracy and transparency of electric transmission line ratings. Specifically, the Commission is requiring: Public utility transmission providers to implement ambient-adjusted ratings on the transmission lines over which they provide transmission service; regional transmission organizations (RTO) and independent system operators (ISO) to establish and implement the systems and procedures necessary to allow transmission owners to electronically update transmission line ratings at least hourly; public utility transmission providers to use uniquely determined emergency ratings; public utility transmission owners to share transmission line ratings and transmission line rating methodologies with their respective transmission provider(s) and with market monitors in RTOs/ISOs; and public utility transmission providers to maintain a database of transmission owners' transmission line ratings and transmission line rating methodologies on the transmission provider's Open Access Same-Time Information System site or other password-protected website.
