## Summary

The U.S Department of Commerce (Commerce) is conducting the administrative review of the antidumping duty order on light-walled rectangular pipe and tube (LWRPT) from the People's Republic of China (China). The period of review (POR) is August 1, 2021, through July 31, 2022. Commerce preliminarily determines that Hangzhou Ailong Metal Product Co., Ltd. (Ailong) failed to establish its eligibility for a separate rate and, therefore, is part of the China-wide entity. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.
