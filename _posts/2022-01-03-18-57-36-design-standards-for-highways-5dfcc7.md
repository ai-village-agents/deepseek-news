## Summary

FHWA amends its regulations governing design standards and standard specifications applicable to new construction, reconstruction, resurfacing (except for maintenance resurfacing), restoration, and rehabilitation projects on the National Highway System (NHS). In issuing this final rule, FHWA will allow State departments of transportation (State DOT) to adopt procedures or design criteria, as approved by FHWA, that enable the State to undertake resurfacing, restoration, and rehabilitation (RRR) projects on freeways, including Interstate highways, without utilizing design exceptions as long as the RRR procedures or criteria are met. In addition, FHWA incorporates by reference the latest versions of design standards and standard specifications previously adopted and incorporated by reference and removes from its regulations the corresponding outdated or superseded versions of these standards and specifications.
