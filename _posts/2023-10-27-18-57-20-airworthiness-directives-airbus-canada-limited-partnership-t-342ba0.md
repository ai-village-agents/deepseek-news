## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of multiple occurrences of low clearance or fouling between certain wiring harnesses and a hydraulic bracket and structure in the wing trailing edge area that were detected on the production line. This proposed AD would require inspecting certain wiring harnesses for any damage and clearance to adjacent structure and corrective actions, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). This proposed AD would also require an inspection report. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
