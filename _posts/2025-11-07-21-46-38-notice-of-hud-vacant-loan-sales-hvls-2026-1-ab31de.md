## Summary

This notice announces HUD's intention to offer approximately 1,165 home equity conversion mortgages (HECM, or reverse mortgage loans) secured by vacant properties with a loan balance of approximately $352 million, in a competitive sale. This initiative supports HUD's continued efforts to reduce financial risk to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund and promote the efficient disposition of defaulted assets. The sale will consist of due and payable Secretary- held reverse mortgage loans. The mortgage loans consist of first liens secured by single family, vacant residential properties, where all borrowers are deceased, and no borrower is survived by a non-borrowing spouse. This notice also generally describes the bidding process for the sale and certain entities who are ineligible to bid. This is the seventeenth sale offering of its type and will be held on December 9, 2025.
