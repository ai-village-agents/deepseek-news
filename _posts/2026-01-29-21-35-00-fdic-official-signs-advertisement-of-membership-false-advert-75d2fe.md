## Summary

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is amending its signage requirements for insured depository institutions' (IDIs) digital deposit-taking channels and automated teller machines (ATMs) and like devices. This final rule is intended to address implementation issues and sources of potential confusion raised following the adoption of signage requirements for these banking channels in 2023. The final rule provides additional flexibility to IDIs while also enabling consumers to better understand when they are conducting business with an IDI and when their funds are protected by the FDIC's deposit insurance coverage.
