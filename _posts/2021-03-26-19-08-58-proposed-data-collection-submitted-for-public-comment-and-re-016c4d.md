## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled National Program of Cancer Registries Program Evaluation Instrument (NPCR-PEI). The NPCR Program Evaluation Instrument (PEI) is a web-based survey instrument designed to evaluate NPCR-funded registries' operational attributes and their progress towards meeting program standards. The PEI monitors the integration of surveillance, registry operations and health information systems, the utilization of established data standards, and the electronic exchange of health data. The PEI serves to inform CDC and NPCR Program Consultants where technical assistance is most needed to continue to improve and enhance the NPCR.
