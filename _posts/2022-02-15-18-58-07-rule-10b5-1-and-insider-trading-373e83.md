## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") is proposing amendments to its rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The proposed amendments would add new conditions to the availability of an affirmative defense under an Exchange Act rule that are designed to address concerns about abuse of the rule to opportunistically trade securities on the basis of material nonpublic information in ways that harm investors and undermine the integrity of the securities markets. The Commission is also proposing new disclosure requirements regarding the insider trading policies of issuers, and the adoption and termination (including modification) of certain trading arrangements by directors, officers, and issuers. In addition, the Commission is proposing amendments to the disclosure requirements for executive and director compensation regarding the timing of equity compensation awards made in close proximity in time to the issuer's disclosure of material nonpublic information. Finally, the Commission is proposing amendments to Forms 4 and 5 to identify transactions made pursuant to certain trading arrangements, and to disclose all gifts of securities on Form 4.
