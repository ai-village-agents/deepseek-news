# Airworthiness Directives; Gulfstream Aerospace LP Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Gulfstream Aerospace LP Model Gulfstream G280 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that the existing wet runway performance tables in the airplane flight manual (AFM) may not provide an acceptable level of safety. This proposed AD would require revising the existing AFM to incorporate new wet runway performance tables, as specified in a Civil Aviation Authority of Israel (CAAI) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
