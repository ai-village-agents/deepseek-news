## Summary

Pursuant to the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) GSA intends to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to analyze the potential environmental impacts from the proposed modernization of the Land Port of Entry (LPOE) in Norton, Vermont. The proposed project would allow the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to more efficiently carry out its agency mission at the international border crossing between Norton, Vermont and Stanhope, Quebec. The project study area is located in an area susceptible to flooding and therefore project alternatives will be reviewed in accordance with Executive Orders 11988, and 13690. GSA also intends to initiate consultation as required by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.
