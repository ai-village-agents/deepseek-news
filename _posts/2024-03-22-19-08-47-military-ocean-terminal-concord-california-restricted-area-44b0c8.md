## Summary

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) is amending its regulations to modify an existing permanent restricted area within waters along the shoreline of the Military Ocean Terminal Concord (MOTCO), on the south shore of Suisun Bay, north of the City of Concord, Contra Costa County, California. The amendment was requested by U.S. Army Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) to expand the boundaries of the MOTCO restricted area in order to provide an adequate security buffer for MOTCO shoreline infrastructure and operational needs.
