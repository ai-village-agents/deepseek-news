## Summary

EPA is partially waiving the 2024 cellulosic biofuel volume requirement and revising the associated percentage standard under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program due to a shortfall in cellulosic biofuel production. This action also makes a minor revision to the biogas provisions of the RFS program.
