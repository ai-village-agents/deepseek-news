## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is requesting comment on a regulatory basis to support a rulemaking that would amend its regulations for decommissioning financial assurance for sealed and unsealed radioactive materials. The rulemaking would revise NRC's decommissioning funding requirements for radioactive material based on the relative risk to public health and safety from different radioisotopes, including naturally occurring and accelerator-produced radioactive material. The potentially affected licensees are those authorized to possess byproduct and special nuclear material.
