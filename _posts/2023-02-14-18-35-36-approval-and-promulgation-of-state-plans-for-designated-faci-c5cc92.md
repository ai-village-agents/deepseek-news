## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a Clean Air Act (CAA) section 111(d) plan submitted by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) on January 19, 2022. This state plan was submitted to fulfill the requirements of the CAA and is responsive to EPA's promulgation of Emissions Guidelines and Compliance Times for municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills. The South Carolina state plan establishes emission limits for existing MSW landfills and provides for the implementation and enforcement of those standards and requirements.
