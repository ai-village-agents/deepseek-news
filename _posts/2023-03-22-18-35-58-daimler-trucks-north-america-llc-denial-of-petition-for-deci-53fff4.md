## Summary

Daimler Trucks North America, LLC (DTNA), has determined that certain model year (MY) 2020-2021 Freightliner Cascadia motor vehicles (heavy trucks) do not fully comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 108, Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated Equipment. DTNA filed a noncompliance report dated May 12, 2020, and amended the report on December 23, 2021. DTNA subsequently petitioned NHTSA (the "Agency") on June 4, 2020, and later amended its petition on July 13, 2020, and again on January 19, 2022, for a decision that the subject noncompliances are inconsequential as they relate to motor vehicle safety. This notice announces the denial of DTNA's petition.
