## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-10-17, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A330-200; A330- 200 Freighter; and A330-300 series airplanes. AD 2017-10-17 requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new fuel airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2017-10-17, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive fuel airworthiness limitations and tasks are necessary. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2017-10-17 and require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate additional new or more restrictive fuel airworthiness limitations and tasks, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. This proposed AD would also expand the applicability to include additional airplane models. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
