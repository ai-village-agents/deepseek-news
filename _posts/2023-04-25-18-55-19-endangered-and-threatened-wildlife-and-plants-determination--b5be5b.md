## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), determine threatened species status under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended, for the Wright's marsh thistle (Cirsium wrightii), a thistle species from New Mexico. We also designate critical habitat. In total, approximately 156.8 acres (63.4 hectares) in Chaves, Eddy, Guadalupe, Otero, and Socorro Counties, New Mexico, fall within the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. This rule adds the species to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. We also finalize a rule under the authority of section 4(d) of the Act that provides measures that are necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation of this species.
