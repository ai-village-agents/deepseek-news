## Summary

The Maritime Administration (MARAD) invites public comments on our intention to request approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to renew an information collection in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The proposed collection OMB 2133-0005 (Uniform Financial Reporting Requirements) is used to evaluate the financial condition of entities borrowing funds from or receiving financial benefits from MARAD. Since the last renewal, the public burden for this collection was updated to include mailing costs for respondents. We are required to publish this notice in the Federal Register to obtain comments from the public and affected agencies.
