## Summary

NHTSA has received petitions asking the Agency to extend the comment period for a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to update Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 213, "Child restraint systems." The NPRM proposed to incorporate a new test sled assembly to conduct compliance tests of child restraints and update a number of the test procedures of the standard. The comment period for the NPRM is scheduled to end on January 4, 2021. In response to petitions from the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, the Agency is extending the comment period by 90 days.
