## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), provide this notice to announce that the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative (KIUC) is preparing a habitat conservation plan (HCP) in support of its anticipated application for an incidental take permit (ITP) under the Endangered Species Act for activities it would undertake in managing existing and future powerlines and lighting. We intend to prepare an environmental impact statement to evaluate the effects on the human environment related to this request, and on any potential issuance of an ITP and implementation of the HCP. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act, we are opening a public scoping period and announcing a virtual public scoping meeting. In 2016, we published a notice of intent to prepare an EIS. Any comments submitted then do not need to be resubmitted, as they will be reconsidered.
