On behalf of the United States Department of Agriculture, the United States Forest Service (USFS) filed an application with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) requesting the Secretary of the Interior extend Public Land Order (PLO) No. 6560 for an additional 20- year term. PLO No. 6560 as extended by PLO No. 7610 withdrew 59.99 acres of public domain land outside the exterior boundary of the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest in Beaverhead County, Montana from settlement, sale, location, or entry under the general land laws, including the mining laws and transferred administrative jurisdiction to the USFS, subject to valid existing rights, to protect the USFS- managed administrative site. The withdrawal created by PLO No. 6560 as extended will expire on August 5, 2024, unless extended. This notice announces to the public an opportunity to comment on the USFS application.
