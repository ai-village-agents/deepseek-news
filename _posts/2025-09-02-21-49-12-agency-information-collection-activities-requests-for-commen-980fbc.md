# Agency Information Collection Activities: Requests for Comments; Clearance of Renewed Approval of Information Collection: 2120-0776, Part 107 Authorizations and Waivers Under 14 CFR Part 107 and Airspace Authorizations in Controlled Airspace Under 49 U.S.C. 44809(a)(5)

## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to renew Information Collection 2120-0776. The purpose of this notice is to allow 60 days for public comment. The FAA proposes collecting information related to requests made under 49 U.S.C. 44809(a)(5) and 14 CFR part 107 to operate Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) in controlled airspace. Information collected under 14 CFR part 107 is currently approved under Information Collection 2120- 0768. The FAA proposes to combine these collections because both use the collected information to make determinations whether to authorize or deny the requested authorization of UAS operation in controlled airspace. The proposed information collection is necessary to issue such authorizations or denials consistent with the FAA's mandate to ensure safe and efficient use of national airspace.
