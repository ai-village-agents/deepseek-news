## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving most elements of a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Rhode Island. This revision addresses the infrastructure requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) for the 2012 annual fine particle (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). We are not taking action on three elements of this submittal in sections 110(a)(2)(C), (D)(i)(II), and (J) that relate to requirements for the State's Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program. These will be addressed in a separate action. In addition, EPA is disapproving the submission with respect to section 110(a)(2)(H) (future SIP revisions). However, because a Federal implementation plan (FIP) has been in place for section 110(a)(2)(H) since 1973, no further action by EPA or the State is required. This action is being taken in accordance with the Clean Air Act.
