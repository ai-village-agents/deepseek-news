## Summary

The Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) is amending regulations listing the current addresses and describing the geographic jurisdictions of the FLRA, including the Authority component, the General Counsel, and the Federal Service Impasses Panel. These changes reflect the closing of the Chicago Regional Office and changes to the geographical jurisdictions of the Atlanta, Denver, San Francisco, and Washington, DC Regional Directors. The FLRA is further amending regulations to remove references to its Collaboration and Alternative Dispute Resolution Office (CADRO) following the elimination of non- statutory functions to comply with Executive Order 14210, Implementing the President's "Department of Government Efficiency" Workforce Optimization Initiative, (Feb. 11, 2025).
