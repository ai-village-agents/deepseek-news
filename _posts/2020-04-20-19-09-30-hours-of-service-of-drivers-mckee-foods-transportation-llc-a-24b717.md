## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to renew McKee Foods Transportation, LLC's (MFT) exemption from the hours-of-service (HOS) regulation pertaining to the use of a sleeper berth. Current HOS rules require that all sleeper-berth rest regimens include, in part, the regular use of a sleeper-berth period for at least 8 hours--combined with a separate period of at least 2 hours, either in the sleeper berth, off duty, or some combination of both--to gain the equivalent of at least 10 consecutive hours off duty. The exemption enables MFT team drivers to take the equivalent of 10 consecutive hours off duty by splitting sleeper-berth time into two periods totaling 10 hours, provided neither of the two periods is less than 3 hours. FMCSA has analyzed the exemption application and the public comments and has determined that the exemption, subject to the terms and conditions imposed, will achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent such exemption.
