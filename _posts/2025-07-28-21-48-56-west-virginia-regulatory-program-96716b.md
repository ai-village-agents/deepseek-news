## Summary

We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), are approving an amendment to the West Virginia regulatory program under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). The amendment revises the West Virginia Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Act (WVSCMRA) as contained in House Bill 4758 of 2022. The revisions require the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (WVDEP) to develop and maintain a database to track reclamation liabilities, including water treatment, at coal mining operations in the state of West Virginia that were permitted after August 3, 1977, and for which the SMCRA permit has yet to be completely released. The database of reclamation liabilities will serve to inform management and operation of WVDEP's Special Reclamation Program.
