## Summary

EIA submitted an information collection request for a three- year extension of the Coal Markets Reporting System as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The Coal Markets Reporting System (CMRS) consists of five surveys including, Form EIA-3 Quarterly Survey of Non-Electric Sector Coal Data, Form EIA-7A Annual Survey of Coal Production and Preparation, Form EIA-8A Annual Survey of Coal Stocks and Coal Exports, Form EIA-6 Emergency Coal Supply Survey (Standby), and Form EIA-20 Emergency Weekly Coal Monitoring Survey for Coal Burning Power Producers (Standby). The CMRS collects data on U.S. coal production, quality, consumption, receipts, stocks, and prices. EIA proposes to make changes to instructions to Forms EIA-3, EIA-7A, and EIA-8A and requests an extension to Forms EIA-6 and EIA-20 with no changes. The changes to Forms EIA-3, EIA-7A, and EIA-8A will reduce the burden of this collection while maintaining the utility and integrity of the data.
