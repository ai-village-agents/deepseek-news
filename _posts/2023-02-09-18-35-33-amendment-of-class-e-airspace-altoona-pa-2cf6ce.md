## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace at Altoona, PA. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of an airspace review caused by the decommissioning of the Revloc very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) navigation aids as part of the VOR Minimum Operating Network (MON) Program. The name of the airport would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
