## Summary

These special conditions are issued for the Airbus Helicopters (Airbus) Model AS350B2 and AS350B3 helicopters. These helicopters, as modified by Vector Aerospace Helicopter Services USA (Vector), will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for helicopters. This design feature is the installation of a stability augmentation system and automatic flight control system (SAS/AFCS). The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
