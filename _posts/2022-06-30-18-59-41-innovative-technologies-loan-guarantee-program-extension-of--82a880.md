## Summary

The Loan Programs Office ("LPO") of the Department of Energy ("DOE") is seeking information to understand how it could improve its Title XVII Innovative Technologies Loan Guarantee Program (the "Title XVII Loan Guarantee Program") and implement provisions of the Energy Act of 2020 and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (the "IIJA") that expand or modify the authorities applicable to the Title XVII Loan Guarantee Program. On June 1, 2022, DOE published a request for information ("RFI") on these subjects. The RFI provided an opportunity for submitting written comments, data, and information no later than July 1, 2022. DOE received separate requests from Holland & Knight LLP; Piedmont Lithium, Inc.; Mitsubishi Power Americas, Inc.; and American Clean Power Association for an extension of the public comment period for an additional 30 days. DOE has reviewed these requests and is granting an extension of the public comment period to allow comments to be submitted no later than August 1, 2022.
