## Summary

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is amending its regulations governing the requirements and procedures for juveniles seeking classification as a Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) and related adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident (LPR). This rule codifies statutorily mandated changes and clarifies the following: the definitions of key terms, such as "juvenile court" and "judicial determination"; what constitutes a qualifying juvenile court order for SIJ purposes; what constitutes a qualifying parental reunification determination; DHS's consent function; and applicable bars to adjustment, inadmissibility grounds, and waivers for SIJ-based adjustment to LPR status. This rule also removes bases for automatic revocation that are inconsistent with the statutory requirements of the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA 2008) and makes other technical and procedural changes. DHS is issuing this rule to update the regulations as required by law, further align SIJ classification with the statutory purpose of providing humanitarian protection to eligible child survivors of parental abuse, abandonment, or neglect, and clarify the SIJ regulations.
