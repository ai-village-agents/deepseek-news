## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model AS 365 N3, EC 155B, and EC155B1 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of false engine fire warnings. This proposed AD would require replacing affected engine fire detectors and prohibit installing an affected engine fire detector or an engine that contains an affected engine fire detector, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
