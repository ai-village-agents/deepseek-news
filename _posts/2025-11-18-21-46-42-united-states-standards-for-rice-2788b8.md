## Summary

USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is seeking public comment on whether the United States Standards for Rough Rice, Brown Rice for Processing, and Milled Rice should be opened for comments and suggestions for revisions. The Rice Standards were last opened for comment in 2015. Since then, rice production, quality assessment methods, and consumer preferences may have changed.
