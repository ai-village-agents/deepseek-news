## Summary

This action amends Class D airspace, Class E airspace designated as an extension to a Class D surface area, and Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Boire Field, Nashua, NH, to accommodate airspace reconfiguration due to the decommissioning of CHERN non-directional beacon, and cancellation of the associated approaches. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at this airport. This action also updates the geographic coordinates of this airport, as well as Manchester VOR/DME. In addition, this action recognizes the name change of Pepperell Airport (formerly Sports Center Airport). This action also replaces the outdated term Airport/Facility Directory with the term Chart Supplement in the legal descriptions of associated Class D and E airspace of Boire Field. Also, the FAA inadvertently failed to address the purpose of the radius of Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface increasing from 7.0 miles to 7.9 miles. In addition, the Manchester VOR/DME was incorrectly identified as VORTAC. This action corrects these errors.
