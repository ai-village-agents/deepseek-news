## Summary

In accordance with the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA or the Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) is providing notice of a proposed consent decree in California Communities Against Toxics, et al. v. Regan, No. 1:22-cv-03724 (D.D.C.). On December 14, 2022, Plaintiffs California Communities Against Toxics, Clean Power Lake County, Rio Grande International Study Center, Sierra Club, and Union of Concerned Scientists filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that EPA has failed to perform its nondiscretionary duty to "review, and revise as necessary" the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Ethylene oxide Emissions Standards for Sterilization Facilities, at least every 8 years. The proposed consent decree would establish a deadline for EPA to sign a final rule for this action.
