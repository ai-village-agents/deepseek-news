## Summary

The Rural Business-Cooperative Service (Agency), an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Rural Development (RD), is making an initial announcement to invite applications for loans and grants under the Rural Microentrepreneur Assistance Program (RMAP) for fiscal year (FY) 2023, subject to the availability of funding. This notice is being issued prior to the passage of a FY 23 Appropriations Act, which may or may not provide funding for this program, in order to allow applicants sufficient time to leverage financing, prepare and submit their applications, and give the Agency time to process applications within FY23. Successful applications will be selected by the Agency for funding and subsequently awarded to the extent that funding may ultimately be made available through appropriations. RMAP provides the following types of support: loan only, combination loan and technical assistance grant, and subsequent technical assistance grants to Microenterprise Development Organizations (MDO). An announcement will be made on the Agency website: https://www.rd.usda.gov/newsroom/federal-funding-opportunities regarding any amount received in the FY23 appropriations. All applicants are responsible for any expenses incurred in developing their applications or any costs incurred prior to the obligation date.
