## Summary

In this final rule, NMFS implements an annual catch limit (ACL) of 295,419 lb (134 metric tons (t)), an annual catch target (ACT) of 291,010 lb (132 t), and accountability measures (AM) for main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) uku for fishing years 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025. These ACLs and ACTs apply to the total combined commercial and non-commercial catch of uku. As an in-season accountability measure, if NMFS projects that the total catch will reach the ACT in any given fishing year, we would close commercial and non-commercial uku fisheries in Federal waters for the remainder of the fishing year. As a post-season AM, if NMFS determines that the most recent three-year average total catch exceeded the ACL in a fishing year, we would reduce the ACL and ACT for the following fishing year by the amount of the overage. This rule supports the long-term sustainability of MHI uku.
