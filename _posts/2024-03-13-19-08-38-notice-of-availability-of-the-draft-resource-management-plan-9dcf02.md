## Summary

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (NEPA), and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, as amended (FLPMA), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service (USDA Forest Service), collectively "the Agencies," have prepared a Draft Resource Management Plan (RMP) and Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Bears Ears National Monument (BENM or Monument), and by this notice are providing information announcing the opening of the comment period on the Draft RMP/EIS and the comment period on proposed areas of critical environmental concern (ACECs) on lands managed by the BLM and proposed recreational shooting closures. The BLM is leading the NEPA process in partnership with the USDA Forest Service, which will sign a decision for the USDA Forest Service-managed lands based on the analysis in the EIS. The Agencies have and will continue to meaningfully engage the Bears Ears Commission in the development of the RMP and EIS, as required by Proclamation 10285.
