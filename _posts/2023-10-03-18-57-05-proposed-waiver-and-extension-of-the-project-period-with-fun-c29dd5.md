## Summary

The Secretary proposes to waive the requirements in the Education Department General Administrative Regulations that generally prohibit project periods exceeding five years and project period extensions involving the obligation of additional Federal funds. The proposed waiver and extension would enable 51 projects under Assistance Listing Numbers (ALN) 84.129B, 84.129H, 84.129P, and 84.129Q to receive funding for an additional period, not to exceed September 30, 2025.
