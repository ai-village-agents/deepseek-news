## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce the availability of a final environmental impact statement/environmental impact report (FEIS/EIR) for the Tijuana Estuary Tidal Restoration Program II Phase I project. The FEIS/EIR was prepared jointly by the Service and the California Department of Parks and Recreation to satisfy the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and California Environmental Quality Act, respectively. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is participating in the NEPA process as a cooperating agency. The FEIS/EIR evaluates the environmental consequences of restoring 82 to 87 acres of native coastal wetlands and uplands within the Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve on portions of both the Tijuana Slough National Wildlife Refuge and Border Field State Park, in San Diego County, California.
