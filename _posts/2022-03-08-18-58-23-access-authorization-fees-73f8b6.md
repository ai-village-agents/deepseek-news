# Access Authorization Fees

## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is withdrawing a direct final rule that would have updated the access authorization fees charged to NRC licensees for work performed under the Material Access Authorization Program and the Information Access Authority Program. The direct final rule also would have made two administrative changes to revise definitions to include new naming conventions for background investigation case types and to specify the electronic process for completing security forms. The NRC is taking this action because it has received a significant adverse comment in response to the companion proposed rule that was published with the direct final rule.
