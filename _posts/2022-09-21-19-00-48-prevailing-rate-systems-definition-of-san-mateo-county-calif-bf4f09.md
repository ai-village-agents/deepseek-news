## Summary

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing a rule to define San Mateo County, California, as an area of application county to the Monterey, CA, nonappropriated fund (NAF) Federal Wage System (FWS) wage area. This change is necessary because there are three NAF FWS employees working in San Mateo County, and the county is not currently defined to a NAF wage area.
