## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, announce the availability of documents related to an application for an incidental take permit (permit) under the Endangered Species Act. The City of Gunnison, Colorado, has applied for a permit, which, if granted, would authorize take of the federally threatened Gunnison sage-grouse that is likely to occur incidental to proposed residential and commercial development. The documents available for review and comment are the applicant's habitat conservation plan, which is part of the permit application, and our draft environmental action statement and low- effect screening form, which support a categorical exclusion under the National Environmental Policy Act. We invite comments from the public and Federal, Tribal, State, and local governments.
