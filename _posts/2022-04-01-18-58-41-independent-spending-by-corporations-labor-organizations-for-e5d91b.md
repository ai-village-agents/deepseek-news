# Independent Spending by Corporations, Labor Organizations, Foreign Nationals, and Certain Political Committees (Citizens United)

## Summary

The Commission announces its disposition of two Petitions for Rulemaking filed on June 19 and June 22, 2015. The Petitions asked the Commission to revise existing regulations and issue new regulations concerning: Disclosure of certain financing information regarding independent expenditures and electioneering communications, election- related spending by foreign nationals; solicitations of corporate and labor organization employees and members; and the independence of expenditures made by independent-expenditure-only political committees and accounts. Because there were not four affirmative votes in support of the Petitions, the Commission is not initiating a rulemaking.
