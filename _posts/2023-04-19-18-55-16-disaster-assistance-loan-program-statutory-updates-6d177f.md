## Summary

SBA is amending the disaster assistance regulations to reflect changes made to the Small Business Act by several recent statutes. These changes provide two new types of disaster declaration authority and revise eligibility for the Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan (MREIDL) program. This direct final rule conforms the regulations to the Act by adopting the new statutory requirements without change.
