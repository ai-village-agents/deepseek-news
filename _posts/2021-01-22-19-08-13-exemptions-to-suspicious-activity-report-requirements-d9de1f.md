## Summary

The OCC is inviting comment on a proposed rule that would modify the requirements for national banks and federal savings associations to file Suspicious Activity Reports. The proposed rule would amend the OCC's Suspicious Activity Report regulations to allow the OCC to issue exemptions from the requirements of those regulations. The proposed rule makes it possible for the OCC to grant relief to national banks or federal savings associations that develop innovative solutions intended to meet Bank Secrecy Act requirements more efficiently and effectively.
