## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) debarring Matthew Dailey for a period of 10 years from importing or offering for import any drug into the United States. FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Dailey was convicted, as defined in the FD&C Act, of one felony count under Federal law for introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce and one felony count of importing merchandise contrary to law. The factual basis supporting both felony convictions, as described below, is conduct relating to the importation into the United States of a drug or controlled substance. Mr. Dailey was given notice of the proposed debarment and was given an opportunity to request a hearing within the timeframe prescribed by regulation to show why he should not be debarred. As of November 8, 2019 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Mr. Dailey had not responded. Mr. Dailey's failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this matter.
