## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 9 is proposing to reissue a NPDES general permit authorizing discharges of treated effluent from bulk fuel storage facilities located in Guam (Permit No. GUG000001). EPA proposes to reissue the permit upon completion of the notice and comment period and after consideration of all comments received. Upon issuance, the permit will be valid for five years. Use of a NPDES general permit allows EPA and dischargers to allocate resources in a more efficient manner while ensuring consistent permit conditions for comparable facilities. This notice announces the availability of the proposed NPDES general permit and the corresponding fact sheet for public comment, both of which can be found on EPA Region 9's website: https://www.epa.gov/npdes-permits/npdes-permits-epas- pacific-southwest-region-9. EPA is also taking comments on the frequency, duration, and volume of water discharges from each bulk fuel facility for the years including 2019 to 2024.
