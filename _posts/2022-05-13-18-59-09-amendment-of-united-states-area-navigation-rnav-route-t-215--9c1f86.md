## Summary

This action amends United States Area Navigation (RNAV) route T-215 in the central United States due to the decommissioning of the Holston Mountain, TN, (HMV) VHF Omnidirectional Range Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC), and the Hazard, KY, (AZQ) Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) in support of the VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Minimum Operational Network (MON) program. Additionally, this action extends T-215 to the north and south of its current limits to expand the availability of RNAV in the National Airspace System (NAS). This action also establishes T-408 that was proposed previously in a separate docket action.
