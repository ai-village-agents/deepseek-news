## Summary

The Department of Commerce (Commerce) is conducting the 24th administrative review of the antidumping duty (AD) order on fresh garlic from the People's Republic of China (China). The period of review (POR) for this administrative review is November 1, 2017 through October 31, 2018. Commerce preliminarily determines that mandatory respondent, Shijiazhuang Goodman Trading Co., Ltd. (Goodman), sold subject merchandise to the United States at less than normal value (NV). We also preliminarily find that the review requests made by the Coalition for Fair Trade in Garlic, and its individual members (collectively, the CFTG), and Roots Farm Inc. (Roots Farm) were not valid, and accordingly have preliminarily rescinded the review with respect to nineteen companies, including the other mandatory respondent, Zhengzhou Harmoni Spice Co., Ltd. (Harmoni). We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.
