## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Costruzioni Aeronautiche Tecnam S.P.A. (Tecnam) Model P2006T airplanes. This AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. This AD requires performing a detailed visual inspection (DVI) of the aileron control assembly, repairing the aileron control assembly if any crack or damage (including missing paint, nicks, or scrapes) is found, measuring the length of the screws installed on the ceiling cover panel, and replacing the screws if found to be of excessive length. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
