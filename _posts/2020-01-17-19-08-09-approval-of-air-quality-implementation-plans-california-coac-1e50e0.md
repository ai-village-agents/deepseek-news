## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve, or conditionally approve, all or portions of two state implementation plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of California to meet Clean Air Act requirements for the 2008 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or "standards") in the Coachella Valley ozone nonattainment area ("Coachella Valley"). The two SIP revisions include the portions of the "Final 2016 Air Quality Management Plan" and the "2018 Updates to the California State Implementation Plan" that address ozone in the Coachella Valley. These submittals address the nonattainment area requirements for the 2008 8- hour ozone NAAQS, including the requirements for an emissions inventory, emissions statements, attainment demonstration, reasonable further progress (RFP), reasonably available control measures, contingency measures, and motor vehicle emissions budgets. The EPA is proposing to approve these submittals as meeting all the applicable ozone nonattainment area requirements except for the contingency measure requirements, for which the EPA is proposing to conditionally approve the RFP contingency measures and to defer action on the attainment contingency measure.
