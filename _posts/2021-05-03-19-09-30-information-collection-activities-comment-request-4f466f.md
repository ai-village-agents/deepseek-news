## Summary

The Department of Labor, as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, conducts a pre-clearance consultation program to provide the general public and Federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on proposed and/or continuing collections of information in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This program helps to ensure that requested data can be provided in the desired format, reporting burden (time and financial resources) is minimized, collection instruments are clearly understood, and the impact of collection requirements on respondents can be properly assessed. Currently, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is soliciting comments concerning the proposed reinstatement without change of the "Current Population Survey (CPS) Unemployment Insurance (UI) Non-Filer Supplement" to be conducted in February 2022 and May 2022. A copy of the proposed information collection request (ICR) can be obtained by contacting the individual listed below in the addresses section of this notice.
