## Summary

This agenda announces the regulatory and deregulatory actions the Department of Defense (DoD) plans to take in the next 12 months and those regulatory and deregulatory actions completed since the publication of the Fall 2024 Unified Agenda. It was developed under the guidelines of Executive Order 12866, "Regulatory Planning and Review," and Executive Order 13563, "Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review." This agenda includes actions that support the Administration's priorities, the Secretary of Defense's top priorities to revive warrior ethos, rebuild our military, reestablish deterrence, as well as those priorities of the National Defense Strategy. These actions include efforts to make America safe, make America affordable and energy dominant, and bring back American values. Members of the public may submit comments on individual proposed and interim final rulemakings at www.regulations.gov during the comment period that follows publication in the Federal Register. This agenda updates the report published on December 13, 2024, and includes regulations expected to be issued or under review by DoD over the next 12 months. The next agenda will publish in the fall of 2025. The complete Unified Agenda will be available online at www.reginfo.gov. In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 602), which requires agencies to publish their regulatory flexibility agendas in the Federal Register, the Department of Defense's printed agenda entries in the Federal Register include only: (1) rules that are in the Agency's regulatory flexibility agenda, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, because they are likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities; and (2) Any rules that the Agency has identified for periodic review under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 610). Although printing of these entries is limited to fields that contain information required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act's agenda requirements, additional information on these entries is in the Unified Agenda available online.
