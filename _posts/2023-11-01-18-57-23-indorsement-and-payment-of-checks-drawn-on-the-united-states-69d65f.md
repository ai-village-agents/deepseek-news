## Summary

The Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) of the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) is amending its regulations that govern the payment of checks drawn on the United States Treasury (Treasury checks). The amendments coincide with the development of Fiscal Service's enhanced check post payment processing system, which will provide Treasury check return information to financial institutions more quickly than today. Financial institutions will receive this information through their existing communication channels with the Federal Reserve Banks (FRBs), generally prior to the expiration of the time periods in which financial institutions must make Treasury check deposits available for withdrawal as prescribed by Regulation CC, Availability of Funds and Collection of Checks. Accordingly, Fiscal Service is amending its regulations so that, with certain exceptions, a financial institution will be liable if it pays a canceled Treasury check, also known as a payment over cancellation (POC), without waiting to receive the return information that would enable the financial institution to know the check has been canceled.
