## Summary

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Paria River District Office announces the availability of the Records of Decision (RODs) for the Approved Resource Management Plans (RMPs) for the Grand Staircase, Kaiparowits, and Escalante Canyons units of the Grand Staircase- Escalante National Monument (GSENM) and the Federal lands excluded from the GSENM by Proclamation 9682, now identified as the Kanab-Escalante Planning Area (KEPA). The Department of the Interior (DOI) Acting Assistant Secretary, Land and Minerals Management, Casey Hammond, signed the RODs on January 31, 2020, which constituted the final decision of the DOI and made the Approved RMPs and two implementation- level route designations in GSENM effective immediately. The GSENM RMPs replace the GSENM Monument Management Plan (MMP) from 2000 for public lands within the GSENM boundary. The KEPA RMP replaces the 2000 GSENM MMP for public lands excluded from the monument boundary by Proclamation 9682.
