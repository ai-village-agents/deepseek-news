The Directorate of Public Works offers training opportunities and tools to military and civilian facility managers to prepare them for their role. The first step for a newly assigned facility manager is to sign up for the DPW Facility Management Class, which includes instruction on all aspects of facility management. Unit leadership ensuring facility managers are assigned to barracks is especially critical to addressing living space issues quickly.
