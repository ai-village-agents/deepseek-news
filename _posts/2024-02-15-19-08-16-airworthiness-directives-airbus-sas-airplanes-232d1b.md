## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-16- 11, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A300 F4-605R and FR-622R airplanes. AD 2019-16-11 required repetitive high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections of the aft lower deck cargo door (LDCD) frame forks; a one-time check of the LDCD clearances; a one-time detailed visual inspection of hooks, eccentric bushes, and x-stops; and corrective actions if necessary. This AD was prompted by a determination that the threshold for the (repetitive) HFEC inspection needs to be corrected, and the LDCD frame forks modified. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2019-16-11, requires correcting the HFEC inspection threshold and modifying the LDCD frame forks, and prohibits the installation of affected LDCDs under certain conditions; as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
