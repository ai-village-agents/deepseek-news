## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model SA330J helicopters. This AD was prompted by the determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD requires revising the existing maintenance records by incorporating new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
