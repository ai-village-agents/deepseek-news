## Summary

This rule announces the Pandemic Cover Crop Program (PCCP) to provide support for agricultural producers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic for the 2022 crop year. USDA is dedicating funding to reach a broader set of producers than in previous COVID-19 assistance programs, with a specific focus on strengthening outreach to underserved producers and communities and small and medium agricultural operations. As a part of that initiative, this rule establishes PCCP for 2022.
