## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to designate critical habitat for 12 federally endangered species on the island of Hawai[revaps]i under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. In total, approximately 122,277 acres (49,484 hectares) on the island of Hawai[revaps]i, in the State of Hawaii, fall within the boundaries of the proposed critical habitat designation. We announce a public informational meeting and public hearing on, and the availability of a draft economic analysis for, this proposed designation. In addition, we announce our determination that designation of critical habitat is not prudent for two federally endangered species on the island of Hawai[revaps]i under the Act.
