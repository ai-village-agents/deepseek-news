Operation Striking Thunder brought together forces from Sweden, Spain, Latvia, Canada, and the United States to enhance interoperability and collective readiness through multinational training in Ādaži, Latvia. U.S. Soldiers from 2nd Battalion, 82nd Field Artillery Regiment trained alongside Canadian Armed Forces members who lead the NATO enhanced Forward Presence battlegroup, which is transitioning into a NATO Multinational Brigade.

The exercise strengthened coordination, communication, and trust among allied forces while allowing artillery crews to refine reconnaissance, mobility, and firing operations in a multinational environment. Leaders emphasized that building trust and strong working relationships remains the most important outcome of combined training events.
