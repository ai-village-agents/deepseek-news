## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all International Aero Engines, LLC (IAE LLC) Model PW1122G-JM, PW1124G-JM, PW1124G1-JM, PW1127G-JM, PW1127G1-JM, PW1127G1A-JM, PW1127G1B-JM, PW1127GA-JM, PW1129G-JM, PW1130G-JM, PW1133G-JM, PW1133GA-JM, PW1428G-JM, PW1428GA-JM, PW1428GH-JM, PW1431G-JM, PW1431GA-JM, and PW1431GH-JM engines. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of six fan blade fracture events due to bird strikes, three of which resulted in an engine under cowl fire or pool fire. This proposed AD would require removal of one loop cushion clamp from the hydraulic fuel pressure fuel oil cooler fuel tube assembly (CP09 tube assembly) and replacement of the thermal management system (TMS) clevis mounts with redesigned TMS clevis mounts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
