## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is amending the test procedures for ceiling fans to include a definition for "circulating air" for the purpose of the ceiling fan definition; include ceiling fans greater than 24 feet within the scope of the test procedure; include certain belt-driven ceiling fans within the scope of the test procedure; specify that certain very small-diameter ceiling fans are not required to be tested; maintain applicability of the standby power test procedure to large-diameter ceiling fans; specify instructions for testing ceiling fans with certain accessories or features; clarify test voltage for large-diameter ceiling fans; amend the low speed definition and increase low speed tolerance for stability criteria; permit an alternate set-up to collect air velocity test data and provide greater specificity regarding sensor orientation; amend the blade thickness measurement requirement; update instrument measurement resolution, represented values, rounding instructions, and enforcement provisions; and codify current guidance on calculating several values reported on the EnergyGuide label. DOE is also updating references to an industry test standard to reference the latest version.
