## Summary

NMFS will hold a 3-day Atlantic Highly Migratory Species (HMS) Climate Vulnerability Assessment (CVA) public workshop and webinar in May 2023. NMFS uses CVAs to identify which species may be most vulnerable based on their exposure to projected changes in the environment (e.g., warming oceans) and their sensitivity or adaptability to handle those changes based on their life history characteristics. In-person workshops are a key component of the CVA scoring process. This workshop will allow a scientific panel of 15 experts to evaluate species sensitivity to climate change, identify and fix errors in scoring, allow for appropriate consideration of new information, address bias, and provide their individual scores for, and opinions on, HMS. The meeting is open to the public.
