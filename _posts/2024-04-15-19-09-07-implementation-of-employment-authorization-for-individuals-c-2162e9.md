## Summary

On February 14, 2024, President Joseph Biden issued a memorandum to the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) determining that it was in the foreign policy interest of the United States to defer for 18 months, the removal of certain Palestinians present in the United States and to provide them with employment authorization documentation. The memorandum directed the Secretary to make provision for immediate allowance of employment authorization for such individuals. This notice provides information about Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) for Palestinians and provides information on how eligible individuals may apply for DED-based Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) with USCIS, as well as for travel authorization.
