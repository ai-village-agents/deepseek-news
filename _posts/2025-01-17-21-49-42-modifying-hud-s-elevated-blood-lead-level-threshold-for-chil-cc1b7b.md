## Summary

This notice announces HUD's modifying its elevated blood lead level (EBLL) threshold under its Lead Safe Housing Rule from to 5 to 3.5 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood ([micro]g/dL) for a child under the age of 6, consistent with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's current blood lead reference value of 3.5 [micro]g/dL. This notice also describes the required compliance dates for implementing this modification, which depend on whether the applicable State, State-level jurisdiction, territory, or local jurisdiction has already incorporated a blood lead level action threshold equal to or lower than the CDC's current blood lead reference value.
