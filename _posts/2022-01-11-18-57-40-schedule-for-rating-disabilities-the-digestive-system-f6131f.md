## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes to amend the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (VASRD or rating schedule) that addresses the Digestive System. These changes add medical conditions not currently in the rating schedule, revise the rating criteria to reflect medical advances that have occurred since the last revision, clarify existing rating criteria, and update medical terminology. The proposed rule also reflects recommendations from the 2007 report of the National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine, "A 21st Century System for Evaluating Veterans for Disability Benefits." In fashioning this proposed rule, VA considered the most up-to-date medical knowledge and clinical practice of gastroenterology and hepatology specialties.
