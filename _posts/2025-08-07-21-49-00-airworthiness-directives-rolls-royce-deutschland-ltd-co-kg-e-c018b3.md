# Airworthiness Directives; Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG Engines

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Model Trent 7000-72 and Trent 7000-72C engines. This proposed AD was prompted by the manufacturer's determination that certain intervals for visual inspection of the intermediate pressure 8 (IP8) and high pressure 3 (HP3) air tubes need to be reduced for certain engines, and instructions for visual inspection of the IP8 and HP3 air tubes were not available for certain other engines. This proposed AD would require initial and repetitive visual inspections of the IP8 and HP3 air tubes for cracking, damage, or air leakage wear, and replacement if necessary. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
