## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all MHI RJ Aviation ULC Model CL-600-2C10 (Regional Jet Series 700, 701 & 702), CL-600-2D15 (Regional Jet Series 705), CL-600-2D24 (Regional Jet Series 900), and CL-600-2E25 (Regional Jet Series 1000) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a manufacturing quality escape concerning the installation of the Halon metering device on certain cargo fire extinguisher containers. This proposed AD would require the inspection of cargo fire extinguisher container serial numbers and the replacement of the affected containers. This proposed AD would also limit the installation of affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
