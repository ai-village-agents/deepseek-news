## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) permanently debarring Diana Daffin from providing services in any capacity to a person that has an approved or pending drug product application. FDA bases this order on a finding that Ms. Daffin was convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct that relates to the regulation of any drug product under the FD&C Act. Ms. Daffin was given notice of the proposed permanent debarment and was given an opportunity to request a hearing to show why she should not be debarred. As of April 2, 2023 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Ms. Daffin has not responded to the notice. Ms. Daffin's failure to respond and request a hearing within the prescribed timeframe constitutes a waiver of her right to a hearing concerning this action.
