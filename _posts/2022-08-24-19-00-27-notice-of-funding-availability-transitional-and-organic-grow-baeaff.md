## Summary

The Risk Management Agency (RMA), on behalf of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC), announces the availability of funding under the Transitional and Organic Grower Assistance (TOGA) Program. The TOGA Program aims to assist producers that transition to and continue using organic agricultural systems. To address the economic challenges that arose due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this crop insurance support to growers is a part of building more and better markets for American growers and consumers and increasing the resilience of the food supply chain. TOGA premium assistance will be applied to the premium billing statements for the 2023 reinsurance year, which covers applicable policies with sales closing dates from July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023. For most eligible crops, the 2023 reinsurance year is also the 2023 crop year. However, a few crops are in the 2023 reinsurance year but cover a different crop year. Some examples include raisins, California avocados, macadamia nuts, and several citrus crops.
