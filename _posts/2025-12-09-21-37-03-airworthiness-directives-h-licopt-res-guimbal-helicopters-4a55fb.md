## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all H[eacute]licopt[egrave]res Guimbal (Guimbal) Model Cabri G2 helicopters. This AD was prompted by reports of cracked main rotor swashplates (swashplates). This AD requires repetitively inspecting certain swashplates for cracks and, depending on the results, removing and replacing each cracked swashplate. This AD also prohibits installing an affected swashplate unless it has passed the inspection requirements. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
