## Summary

In accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), the OCC, the Board, and the FDIC (the agencies) may not conduct or sponsor, and the respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), of which the agencies are members, has approved the agencies' publication for public comment of a proposal to revise and extend for three years the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Report) (FFIEC 031, FFIEC 041, and FFIEC 051), which is currently an approved collection of information. The agencies are proposing revisions to the Call Report related to proposed revisions to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standard applicable to depository institution subsidiaries of global systemically important bank holding companies under the agencies' regulatory capital rules.
