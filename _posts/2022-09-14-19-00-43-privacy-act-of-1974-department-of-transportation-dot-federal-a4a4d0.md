## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Transportation (DOT), Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) proposes to modify and reissue an existing system of records notice titled "DOT/FMCSA 010, Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse (Clearinghouse)". This system of records allows FMCSA to collect and maintain records on commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers subject to the commercial driver's license (CDL) and commercial learner's permit (CLP) regulations who have received verified positive DOT drug or alcohol test results, refuse such testing, or otherwise violate FMCSA's drug and alcohol use prohibitions. The Clearinghouse also collects and maintains records on the completion of substance abuse programs as part of the return-to-duty process, as well as forms evidencing drivers' consent to the release of information. In addition, the Clearinghouse collects and maintains records of queries of the system conducted by employers, or service agents acting on their behalf, and State Driver Licensing Agencies (SDLAs). The information in this system is used to enhance compliance with drug and alcohol use and testing regulations by identifying drivers who have committed drug and alcohol violations that render them ineligible to operate a CMV.
