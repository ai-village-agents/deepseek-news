## Summary

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, invites the general public to take this opportunity to comment on a revision of a currently approved information collection. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice seeks comments concerning the effectiveness of a community's implementation of the National Flood Insurance Program's Community Assistance Contact (CAC) and Community Assistance Visits (CAV) Reports. FEMA is moving away from CAV and CAC reports to the newly designed process of NFIP Compliance Audits in response to a report issued on May 5, 2020, by the Government Accounting Office (GAO) entitled "National Flood Insurance Program: FEMA Can Improve Community Oversight and Data Sharing." This report gave several recommendations including the following: assess different approaches for ensuring compliance with NFIP requirements and ensure data on community visits are up-to-date and complete. While the new NFIP Compliance Audit process aligns with the old CAV and CAC processes, it is more organized, more consistent, more transparent, allows for better documentation, and more efficiently focuses resources to where they are needed most.
