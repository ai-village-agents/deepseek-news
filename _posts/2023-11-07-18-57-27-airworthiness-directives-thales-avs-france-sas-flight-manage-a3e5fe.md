## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Thales AVS France SAS (Thales) flight management computer navigation modules (FMC2 NAVM) installed on, but not limited to, airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports that, due to software issues, certain FMC2 NAVM navigation modules provide erroneous data to the flight management computer, compromising safe flight of the airplane. This AD requires revising the existing aircraft flight manual (AFM) for your airplane and updating the navigation database. This AD also prohibits installing a database unless certain procedures were removed. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
