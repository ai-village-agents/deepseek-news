## Summary

Under the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is required to determine the applicable volume requirements for the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) for years after those specified in the statute. This action establishes the applicable volumes and percentage standards for 2023 through 2025 for cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel. This action also establishes the second supplemental standard addressing the judicial remand of the 2016 standard-setting rulemaking. Finally, this action makes several regulatory changes to the RFS program, including changes related to the treatment of biogas and other modifications to improve the program's implementation. At this time EPA is not finalizing proposed provisions related to the generation of RINs from qualifying renewable electricity.
