## Summary

The Inter-American Foundation (IAF), as part of its continuing efforts to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, conducts a preclearance consultation program to provide the general public and federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on proposed and/or continuing collections of information in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This program helps ensure that requested data is provided in the desired format; reporting burden (time and financial resources) is minimized; collection instruments are clearly understood; and the impact of collection requirements on respondents is properly assessed. Currently, the IAF is soliciting comments concerning the information collection of the grant application concept note. The purpose of this form is to reduce the time needed to submit and review a proposal for IAF grant funds. Proponents spend a lot of time completing a proposal for grant funds, and IAF Foundation Representatives spend a lot of time reviewing proposals. Internal staff members are not able to read through all the proposals received each year as a result of the volume of submissions and the length of the materials. Given the high proportion of proposals that do not progress to the "pre-selected" phase of the review process, there is an opportunity to streamline the initial application requirements to only require the key information a Foundation Representative needs to decide whether or not a project is viable for IAF to fund.
