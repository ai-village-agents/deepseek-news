# Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-16-05, which applies to all The Boeing Company Model 777 airplanes. AD 2019-16-05 requires an identification of the part number, and if applicable the serial number, of the Captain's and First Officer's seats, and applicable on-condition actions for affected seats. Since the FAA issued AD 2019-16-05, the FAA has discovered that certain seat part numbers had been inadvertently omitted from the inspection requirements of AD 2019-16-05. This proposed AD would retain the requirements of AD 2019-16-05 and would add inspection of the previously omitted part numbers. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
