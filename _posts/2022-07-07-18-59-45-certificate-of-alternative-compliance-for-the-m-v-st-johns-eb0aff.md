## Summary

The Coast Guard announces that the Chief of Prevention Division, Seventh District has issued certificates of alternative compliance from the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), for the M/V ST. JOHNS (O.N. 1063615). We are issuing this notice because its publication is required by statute. Due to the construction and placement of the masthead lights, stern light, and sidelights the M/V ST. JOHNS cannot fully comply with the light, shape, or sound signal provisions of the 72 COLREGS without interfering with the vessel's design and construction (towing operations). This notification of issuance of certificates of alternative compliance promotes the Coast Guard's marine safety mission.
