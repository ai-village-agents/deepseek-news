## Summary

This action proposes to revoke Jet Route J-184 and establish Area Navigation (RNAV) route Q-180 in the southwest United States. The existing Jet Route has service limitations associated with signal coverage related issues. The new RNAV route would replace the Jet Route, as well as provide additional RNAV routing within the National Airspace System (NAS) in support of transitioning it from a ground- based to satellite-based navigation system.
