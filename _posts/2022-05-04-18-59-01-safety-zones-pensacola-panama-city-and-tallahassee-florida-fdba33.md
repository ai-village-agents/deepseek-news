## Summary

The Coast Guard is establishing three temporary safety zones for the reentry of a capsule launched by Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (Space X) in support of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Crew-3 capsule recovery mission. These three temporary safety zones are located within the Coast Guard Sector Mobile area of responsibility offshore of Pensacola, Panama City, and Tallahassee, Florida. The purpose of this rule is to ensure the safety of vessels, mariners, and the navigable waters in the safety zones during a period when reentry is expected. This action is necessary to provide for the safe recovery of this capsule and astronauts in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone and implements a special activities provision of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. This rule prohibits U.S. flagged vessels from entering the safety zones unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Mobile or a designated representative.
