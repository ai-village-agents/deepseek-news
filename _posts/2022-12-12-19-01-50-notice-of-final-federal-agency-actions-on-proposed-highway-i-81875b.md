## Summary

The FHWA, on behalf of Caltrans, is issuing this notice to announce actions taken by Caltrans, U.S Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) that are final. The actions relate to a proposed highway project on the Interstate 5 (I-5) and State Route 56 (SR 56) from postmile (PM) I-5: R32.7 to R34.8 and SR 56: 0.00 to 2.5 in the County of San Diego, State of California. The action is to provide the amended record of decision (ROD) identifying the Hybrid Alternative (Alternative 4) as the new Selected Alternative to move forward in construction. Alternative 4 is a different alternative than the preferred alternative identified in the Final Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement (EIR/EIS) approved for the project on June 26th, 2017]. Those actions grant licenses, permits, and approvals for the project.
