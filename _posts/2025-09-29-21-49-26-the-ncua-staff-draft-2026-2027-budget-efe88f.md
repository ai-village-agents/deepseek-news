The NCUA's staff draft "detailed business-type budget" is being made available for public review as required by federal statute. The proposed resources will finance the agency's annual operations and capital projects, both of which are necessary for the agency to accomplish its mission of protecting the system of cooperative credit and its member-owners through effective chartering, supervision, regulation, and insurance. Comment instructions are included in the supplementary information section. The schedule for a public hearing about the budget will be announced in a future notice.
