## Summary

The Biological and Environmental Research (BER) Program, as DOE's coordinating office for research on biological systems, bioenergy, environmental science, and Earth system science, is seeking input on the need and the structure of a unified data framework that links or integrates existing data activities within BER. Information produced in response to this request may be used by the BER Advisory Committee (BERAC) to help inform and recommend to BER a strategy for next-generation data management and analysis within a unified framework.
