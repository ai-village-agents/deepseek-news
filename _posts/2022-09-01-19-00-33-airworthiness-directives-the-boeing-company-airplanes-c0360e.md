## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report from Boeing that Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) discovered a design issue in the engine fuel feed system, which could result in fuel flow restrictions to both engines when ice that has accumulated in the airplane fuel feed system suddenly releases into the engines. This AD requires revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to update the limitations on minimum fuel temperatures. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
