## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action under the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act") to approve the "Second 10-Year PM<INF>10</INF> Maintenance Plan for Sacramento County" ("Second 10-Year Maintenance Plan" or "Plan") as a revision to the state implementation plan (SIP) for the State of California ("State"). The Second 10-Year Maintenance Plan includes, among other elements, a base year emissions inventory, a maintenance demonstration, contingency provisions, and motor vehicle emissions budgets ("budgets") for use in transportation conformity determinations, to ensure the continued maintenance of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter of 10 microns or less (PM<INF>10</INF>). As part of this rulemaking, the EPA is finalizing its finding that the 2024, 2027, and 2033 motor vehicle emission budgets are adequate for use in transportation conformity.
