## Summary

All ten Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Regions are proposing for public comment on the proposed 2022 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) general permit for stormwater discharges from construction activities, also referred to as the "proposed 2022 Construction General Permit (CGP)" or the "proposed permit." The proposed permit, once finalized, will replace the existing 2017 CGP that will expire on February 16, 2022. EPA proposes to issue this permit for five (5) years, and to provide permit coverage to eligible operators in all areas of the country where EPA is the NPDES permitting authority, including Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Mexico, most Indian country lands, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories and protectorates except for the U.S. Virgin Islands, and certain federal facilities. EPA seeks comment on the proposed permit and on the accompanying fact sheet, which contains supporting documentation. This Federal Register document describes the proposed permit in general and includes specific topics on which the Agency is particularly seeking comment. EPA encourages the public to read the fact sheet to better understand the proposed permit. The fact sheet and proposed permit can be found at https://www.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater- discharges-construction-activities.
