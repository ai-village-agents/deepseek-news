## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves information on voluntary airport noise compatibility programs. The information to be collected is necessary because noise compatibility program measures are eligible for Federal grants in-aid if they are provided to FAA for review and approval in advance. The respondents are airport sponsors that voluntarily submit noise exposure maps and noise compatibility programs to the FAA for review and approval.
