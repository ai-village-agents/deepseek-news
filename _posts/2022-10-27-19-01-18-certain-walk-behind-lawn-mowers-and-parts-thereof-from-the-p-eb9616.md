In response to a request from MTD Products, Inc (MTD), and its parent company, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (SBD) (collectively, the domestic interested parties), the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is initiating a circumvention inquiry to determine whether certain lawn mowers assembled or completed in the United States by attaching Chinese cutting deck shells (attached to at least one significant non-engine component) to internal combustion engines, are circumventing the antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on certain walk-behind lawn mowers and parts thereof (lawn mowers) from the People's Republic of China (China).
