# Airworthiness Directives; General Electric Company Turbofan Engines

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain General Electric Company (GE) CF6-80E1A2, CF6-80E1A3, CF6- 80E1A4, and CF6-80E1A4/B model turbofan engines. This proposed AD was prompted by a manufacturer investigation that revealed that certain compressor discharge pressure seals (CDP seals) and forward outer seals were manufactured from powder metal material suspected to contain iron inclusion. This proposed AD would require the replacement of the affected CDP seals and forward outer seals. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
