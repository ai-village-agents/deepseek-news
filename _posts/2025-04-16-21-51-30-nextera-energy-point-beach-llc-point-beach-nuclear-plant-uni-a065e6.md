## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC, the Commission) is issuing for public comment Generic Environmental Impact Statement for License Renewal of Nuclear Plants, Supplement 23, Second Renewal, Regarding Subsequent License Renewal (SLR) for Point Beach Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2 (Point Beach), Second Draft Report for Comment (second draft report). This second draft report concerns the NRC staff's review of the environmental impacts of the proposed renewal of Renewed Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-24 and DPR-27 for Point Beach, Units 1 and 2, respectively, for an additional 20 years. Point Beach is located on the western shore of Lake Michigan in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin, approximately 15 miles north-northeast of Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Possible alternatives to the proposed action of SLR include the no-action alternative and reasonable replacement power alternatives. A new notice of opportunity to request a hearing and petition for leave to intervene--limited to contentions based on new information in the second draft report--is also being issued.
