## Summary

The Department of Transportation (DOT) seeks to maximize the use of American-made products and materials in all federally funded projects as part of the Biden-Harris Administration's implementation of the Build America, Buy America Act (the Act), which was included in the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). The implementation of this law will transform DOT's approach to domestic procurement requirements and is designed to drive significant investment in domestic manufacturing, spur job creation and grow the economy. The Department is taking three concurrent actions: (1) DOT is not extending its temporary waiver for construction materials, making that requirement applicable effective November 10, 2022; (2) in a separate notice, DOT is proposing a narrow waiver for de minimis costs, small grants, and minor components; and (3) in this notice, DOT is proposing to take two actions to help transition to the new construction materials standard. First, for DOT awards obligated on or after the effective date of the final waiver, DOT is proposing to waive the construction materials requirements for any contracts entered into before November 10, 2022. Second, DOT is proposing to waive the construction materials requirements for any contracts entered into before March 10, 2023, that result from solicitations published before May 14, 2022.
