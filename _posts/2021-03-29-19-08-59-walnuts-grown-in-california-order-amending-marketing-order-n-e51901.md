## Summary

This final rule amends Marketing Order No. 984, which regulates the handling of walnuts grown in California. The amendments were proposed by the California Walnut Board (Board) and add the authority for the Board to provide credit for certain market promotion expenses paid by handlers against their annual assessments due under the Order and establish requirements to effectuate the new authority. In addition, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) made necessary changes to conform to the amendments adopted.
