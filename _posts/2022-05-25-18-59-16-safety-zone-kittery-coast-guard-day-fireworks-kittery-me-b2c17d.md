## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for certain navigable waters of the Piscataqua River near Kittery, Maine. This action is necessary to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards associated with a fireworks display. This proposed regulation would prohibit entry of vessels or persons into the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Northern New England (COTP) or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
