## Summary

This proposed rule would establish 2020 harvest specifications and management measures for Pacific whiting, shortbelly rockfish and cowcod taken in the U.S. exclusive economic zone off the coasts of Washington, Oregon and California consistent with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Pacific Whiting Act of 2006, and other applicable laws. This rule proposes 2020 harvest specifications for Pacific whiting including the U.S. and coastwide Total Allowable Catch (TAC), the 2020 tribal allocation for the Pacific whiting fishery, allocations for three commercial whiting sectors, and set-asides for Pacific whiting research and incidental mortality in other fisheries. The proposed rule would also adjust the 2020 harvest specifications for shortbelly rockfish and cowcod. The proposed measures are intended to help prevent overfishing, achieve optimum yield, and ensure that management measures are based on the best scientific information available.
