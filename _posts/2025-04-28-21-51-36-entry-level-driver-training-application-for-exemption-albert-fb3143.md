## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to deny Albert Farley, Jr.'s request for an exemption from the theory and behind-the-wheel (BTW) instructor requirements contained in the entry-level driver training (ELDT) regulations for himself as a prospective training instructor. Mr. Farley sought an exemption from the requirement that instructors have at least two years of driving experience of the same or higher class and/or the same endorsement level as the commercial motor vehicle (CMV) to be operated. This exemption would have allowed Mr. Farley to serve as an ELDT instructor for students seeking Class A CDLs without having the required two years of experience driving Class A CDLs. FMCSA analyzed the application and public comments and determined that granting the exemption would not likely achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent such exemption.
