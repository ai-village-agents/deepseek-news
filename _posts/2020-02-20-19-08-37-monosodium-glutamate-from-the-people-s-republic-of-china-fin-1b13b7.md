## Summary

The Department of Commerce (Commerce) has completed the administrative review of the antidumping duty order on monosodium glutamate (MSG) from the People's Republic of China (China) covering the period of review (POR) November 1, 2017 through October 31, 2018. We continue to find that none of the exporters of subject merchandise demonstrated eligibility for a separate rate; therefore, each is part of the China-wide entity. We also continue to find that that the use of facts otherwise available is warranted with respect to the China-wide entity.
