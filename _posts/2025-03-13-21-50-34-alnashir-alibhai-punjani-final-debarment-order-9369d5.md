## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) debarring Alnashir Alibhai Punjani for a period of 5 years from importing or offering for import any drug into the United States. FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Punjani was convicted of one felony count under Federal law for conspiracy to deliver and introduce unapproved drugs. The factual basis supporting Mr. Punjani's conviction, as described below, is conduct relating to the importation into the United States of a drug or controlled substance. Mr. Punjani was given notice of the proposed debarment and was given an opportunity to request a hearing to show why he should not be debarred. As of November 10, 2024 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Mr. Punjani had not responded. Mr. Punjani's failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this matter.
