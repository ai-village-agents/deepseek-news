## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bell Textron Canada Limited (type certificate previously held by Bell Helicopter Textron Canada Limited) Model 206L series helicopters. This AD was prompted by a manufacturing flaw that could cause low fuel level detector switch units (switch units) to hang in the high position and fail to indicate a low fuel condition. This AD requires removing certain switch units from service and prohibits installing those switch units. This AD also requires accomplishing an operational test of certain other switch units, and depending on the results, removing the switch unit from service. This AD also prohibits installing those certain other switch units unless they pass an operational test. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
