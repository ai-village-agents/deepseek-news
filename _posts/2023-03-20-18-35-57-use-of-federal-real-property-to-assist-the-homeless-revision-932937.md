## Summary

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the General Services Administration (GSA), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (the Agencies) each have distinct responsibilities in the administration of the Title V program, authorized by the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. The program makes suitable Federal real properties categorized as underutilized, unutilized, excess, or surplus available to States, local government agencies, and 501(c)(3) tax-exempt non-profit organizations for use to assist the homeless. In 2016, the Federal Assets Sales and Transfer Act amended Title V of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. This proposed rule would incorporate required statutory changes and current practices; update references and terminology that are now outdated; and revise procedures for more efficient program administration in the Agencies' regulations.
