## Summary

Federal public transportation law delegated to the Federal Transit Administrator permits the Administrator of the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to authorize a recipient of FTA funds to transfer land or a facility to a public body for any public purpose with no further obligation to the Federal Government (the Government) if, among other things, no Federal agency is interested in acquiring the asset for Federal use. Accordingly, FTA is issuing this Notice to advise Federal agencies that the Northeast Illinois Regional Commuter Railroad Corporation a/k/a Metra (Metra) intends to transfer the land and building located at 16912 and 16901 Paulina Avenue (respectively), Hazel Crest, Illinois (Subject Property) to the Village of Hazel Crest (Village). Metra used the location as a Passenger Assistance Link building and storage facility from 1987 to the present (33 years). Metra has determined it no longer needs the building for public transportation purposes. The Village plans to utilize the Subject Property as a job training center for the community. The Village hopes to partner with another unit of government and/or local college to equip the building with technology equipment and staff it with career development experts who would be dedicated to helping career seekers find employment in the region.
