## Summary

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requests comments on a draft Memorandum that provides guidance to all Federal agencies to inform the development of regulatory and non-regulatory approaches regarding technologies and industrial sectors that are empowered or enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) and consider ways to reduce barriers to the development and adoption of AI technologies. OMB guidance on these matters seeks to support the U.S. approach to free- market capitalism, federalism, and good regulatory practices (GRPs). The draft Memorandum calls on agencies, when considering regulations or policies related to AI applications, to promote advancements in technology and innovation, while protecting American technology, economic and national security, privacy, civil liberties, and other American values, including the principles of freedom, human rights, the rule of law, and respect for intellectual property. The draft Memorandum is available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/ uploads/2020/01/Draft-OMB-Memo-on-Regulation-of-AI-1-7-19.pdf.
