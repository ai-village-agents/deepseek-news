## Summary

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) invites public comment on one currently approved Information Collection Request (ICR) Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number 1652-0068, abstracted below that we will submit to OMB for a revision in compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected burden. The collection involves gathering information from individuals who plan to visit all TSA facilities in the National Capital Region (NCR). In addition, TSA is revising the collection to transition TSA Forms 2802, 2816A, and 2816B into Common Forms to streamline the information collection process.
