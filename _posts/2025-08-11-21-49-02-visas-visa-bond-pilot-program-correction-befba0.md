## Summary

The Department of State is correcting a temporary final rule that appeared in the Federal Register on August 5, 2025. The document erroneously provided that one of the amendatory instructions would sunset on August 5, 2026. This document corrects that error and also corrects the designation of paragraphs in the rule.
