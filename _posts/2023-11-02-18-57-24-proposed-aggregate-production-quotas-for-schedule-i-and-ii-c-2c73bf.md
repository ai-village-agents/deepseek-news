## Summary

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) proposes to establish the 2024 aggregate production quotas (APQ) for controlled substances in schedules I and II of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and the assessment of annual needs (AAN) for the list I chemicals ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine. For the 2024 quota year, DEA intends to allocate procurement quotas to DEA-registered manufacturers of schedule II controlled substances on a quarterly basis. In order to address domestic drug shortages of controlled substances, procurement quota allocations will be divided between quantities authorized for domestic sales and quantities authorized for export sales.
