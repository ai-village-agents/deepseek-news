## Summary

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency of the United States Department of Commerce, is examining the economic impact and continued need for gas flow calibration services as provided to U.S. industry by the Fluid Metrology Group on NIST's campus in Gaithersburg, Maryland. NIST is also interested in whether there is a need for gas flow meter calibration services not presently offered by NIST. NIST publishes this notice to announce a workshop that will guide NIST planning for the future of its gas flow calibration capabilities, and to request comments on government and industry interest in and needs for (1) gas flow calibrations and whether the present services are meeting those needs, (2) new gas flow calibrations and standards not presently available from NIST, and (3) calibrations and standards for multiphase flows. This is part of the effort to systematically review NIST's Measurement Services to assess gaps and ensure alignment with stakeholders' needs as discussed in the Government Accounting Office report GAO-18-445.
