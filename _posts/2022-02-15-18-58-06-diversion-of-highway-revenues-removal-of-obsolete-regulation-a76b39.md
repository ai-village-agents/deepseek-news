## Summary

Through this final rule, FHWA will remove a regulation from the CFR that has been rendered obsolete by the passage of subsequent legislation. The FHWA believes that because the underlying statutory authority for this regulation has substantially changed since adopted, this final rule eliminates any confusion that may be caused by its existence in the CFR.
