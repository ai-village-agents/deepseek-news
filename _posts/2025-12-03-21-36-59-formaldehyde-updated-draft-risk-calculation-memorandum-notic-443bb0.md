## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or "the Agency") is announcing the availability of and soliciting public comment on an Updated Draft Risk Calculation Memorandum (or "Draft Memorandum") to inform a Revised Draft Risk Evaluation for Formaldehyde Under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The purpose of risk evaluations under TSCA is to determine whether a chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment, without consideration of costs or non-risk factors, including unreasonable risk to potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations identified as relevant to the risk evaluation by EPA, under the conditions of use (COUs). Consistent with statutory obligations and Executive Order 14303, Restoring Gold Standard Science, EPA remains committed to the highest standards of scientific integrity and reliance on the best available scientific information. To that end, and after further consideration of comments raised during the scientific peer review process, EPA is reconsidering the use of certain hazard values in the formaldehyde risk evaluation. This Notice, Draft Memorandum, and the materials included in the docket provide the science and science policy basis for determining how the revised draft inhalation point of departure (POD) impacts the corresponding draft margin of exposure (MOE) estimates and the risk determination for formaldehyde under TSCA. Although the Agency is also providing a revised draft occupational exposure value, EPA is not changing its position that formaldehyde poses unreasonable risk of injury to human health. As such, the Agency is continuing work on a proposed risk management rule for formaldehyde as required by TSCA to ensure statutory deadlines are met and necessary protections are not delayed. EPA is also seeking additional information, specific to how formaldehyde is manufactured and used, which may inform the risk management of formaldehyde. After public comment, the Agency will determine if the proposed revisions discussed in this action warrant updating the Risk Evaluation for Formaldehyde under TSCA.
