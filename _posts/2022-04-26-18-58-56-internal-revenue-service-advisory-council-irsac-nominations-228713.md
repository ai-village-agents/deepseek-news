The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is seeking new members to serve on the Internal Revenue Service Advisory Council (IRSAC). Applications are currently being accepted for appointments that will begin in January 2023. IRSAC members are drawn from substantially diverse backgrounds representing a cross-section of the taxpaying public with substantial, disparate experience in: Tax preparation for individuals, small businesses and large, multi-national corporations; tax-exempt and government entities; information reporting; and taxpayer or consumer advocacy. Nominations of qualified individuals may come from individuals or organizations; applications should describe and document the proposed member's qualifications for IRSAC.
