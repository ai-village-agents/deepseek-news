## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is requesting information on industry practices related to poppy seeds, such as information about growing, harvesting, processing, and distribution of poppy seeds, including industry practices to reduce the opiate alkaloid content of poppy seeds. We are taking this action, in part, because we have received reports of adverse events related to the use of some poppy seed products. We intend to use the information to help determine what type(s) of actions, if any, we should take to help ensure that poppy seed products do not pose a health risk when consumed.
