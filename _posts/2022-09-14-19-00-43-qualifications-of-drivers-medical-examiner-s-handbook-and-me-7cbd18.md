## Summary

FMCSA extends the comment period for its August 16, 2022, notice of proposed regulatory guidance relating to the draft Medical Examiner's Handbook (MEH), which includes updates to the Medical Advisory Criteria published in the United States Code of Federal Regulations. FMCSA received requests for an extension to the comment period from the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association and two individuals. The Agency finds it is appropriate to extend the comment period to provide interested parties additional time to submit their responses to the notice. Therefore, the Agency extends the deadline for the submission of comments to October 31, 2022.
