## Summary

The Children's Gasoline Burn Prevention Act (CGBPA or the Act) mandated, as a consumer product safety rule, the child-resistance requirements for closures on portable gasoline containers published in the voluntary standard, ASTM F2517-05. ASTM F2517 was revised in 2015 and 2017, and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) allowed those revisions to become mandatory pursuant to the Act. On September 1, 2022, the Commission received notice that ASTM F2517 has been revised again. In this direct final rule, the Commission evaluates the revised ASTM F2517-22e1 standard and finds that the revisions carry out the purposes of the CGBPA. Accordingly, pursuant to the Act, the 2022 revisions to the child-resistance requirements of ASTM F2517 will be incorporated into the mandatory standard for closures on portable gasoline containers. This direct final rule updates the Commission's regulation to reflect that the requirements for closures on portable gasoline containers must meet the requirements in ASTM F2517-22e1.
