## Summary

The Department of Labor (DOL), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, conducts a pre- clearance consultation program to provide the general public and federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on proposed and/or continuing collections of information in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA). The program helps ensure that requested data can be provided in the desired format, reporting burden (time and financial resources) is minimized, collection instruments are clearly understood, and the impact of collection requirements on respondents can be properly assessed. The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) is soliciting comments concerning its proposal to obtain approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for renewal of the information collection for its complaint program. OFCCP is requesting OMB approval for two information collection instruments: revisions to the existing "Form CC-4, Complaint Involving Employment Discrimination by a Federal Contractor or Subcontractor" (Form CC-4) and a new instrument, "Form CC-390 Pre-Complaint Inquiry for Employment Discrimination Involving a Federal Contractor or Subcontractor" (Form CC-390). The current OMB approval for Form CC-4 expires on May 31, 2023. A copy of the proposed information collection request can be obtained by contacting the office listed below in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section of this notice or by accessing it at www.regulations.gov.
