# Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of shim installations at certain stub beam to longitudinal floor beam locations that were not installed per specifications, and an evaluation by the design approval holder indicating inadequate baseline inspections for cracking of the stub beam. This proposed AD would require repetitive inspections for any crack of the stub beam straps at certain stations and repairing any crack found. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
