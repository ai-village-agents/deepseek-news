## Summary

The Coast Guard is issuing a final rule extending the validity of a recreational vessel endorsement on a Certificate of Documentation (COD) from 1 to 5 years. Congress passed and the President signed the Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018, which requires the Coast Guard to issue recreational vessel CODs for 5 years. By updating the Code of Federal Regulations to reflect this change, the Coast Guard anticipates this final rule to harmonize with the requirements of the 2018 Act that decreased the burden on recreational vessel owners by requiring COD renewals every 5 years rather than annually.
