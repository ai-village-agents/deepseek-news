## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD- 500-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that at various lavatory and galley locations within the airplane, incorrect terminal lugs were installed which are not compatible with the associated wire gauge. This proposed AD would require removing and replacing existing lug terminals at various lavatory and galley locations, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
