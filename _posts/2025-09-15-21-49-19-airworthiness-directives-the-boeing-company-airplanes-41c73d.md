## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2024-19-14, which applies to certain The Boeing Company Model 777-200, 777-200LR, 777-300, 777-300ER, and 777F series airplanes. AD 2024-19-14 requires repetitive inspections and bond resistance measurement of the bonding jumpers on the first fuel feed tube installed immediately forward of the wing front spar at the left and right main fuel tank penetrations, and applicable corrective actions. Since the FAA issued AD 2024-19-14, the FAA determined that additional inspections are required to address the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would require repetitive detailed inspections (DET), repetitive bond resistance measurement, and applicable on-condition actions. This proposed AD would also expand the applicability and require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate a certain airworthiness limitation. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
