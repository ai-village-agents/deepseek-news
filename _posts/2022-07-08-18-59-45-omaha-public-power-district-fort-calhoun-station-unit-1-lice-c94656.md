## Summary

On August 3, 2021, as supplemented on January 13, 2022, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) received from the Omaha Public Power District (OPPD, the licensee) a license amendment request to add a license condition to include the requirements of a License Termination Plan (LTP) for the Fort Calhoun Station, Unit 1 (FCS). The LTP provides details about the known radiological information for the site, the planned demolition and decommissioning tasks to be completed, and the final radiological surveys and data that must be obtained for termination of the NRC's license for FCS. The NRC is requesting public comments on FCS's LTP and will hold a public meeting to discuss the LTP.
