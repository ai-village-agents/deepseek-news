## Summary

This document amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regulations to reflect the imposition of emergency import restrictions on certain archaeological and ethnological material from Afghanistan. The Acting Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States Department of State, determined that conditions warrant the imposition of emergency restrictions on categories of archaeological material and ethnological material of the cultural heritage of Afghanistan. This document contains the Designated List of Archaeological and Ethnological Material of Afghanistan that describes the types of objects or categories of archaeological and ethnological material to which the import restrictions apply. The emergency import restrictions imposed on certain archaeological and ethnological material of Afghanistan will be in effect until April 28, 2026, unless extended. These restrictions are being imposed pursuant to determinations of the United States Department of State made under the terms of the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act.
