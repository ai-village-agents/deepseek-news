## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the availability of and soliciting comment on interim guidance and methods for adding efficacy claims to antimicrobial products for use on porous materials, including fabrics, textiles, and upholstered items in non- residential settings. Specifically, EPA is seeking public comment on an interim guidance document that describes efficacy testing for antimicrobial products to support claims for use on surfaces of certain porous materials in clinical and institutional (non-residential) settings and how to prepare an application for registration, an interim quantitative method for evaluating the efficacy of antimicrobial products on porous surfaces against viruses, and an interim quantitative method for evaluating the efficacy of antimicrobial products on porous surfaces against bacteria. The interim guidance does not address residential use sites with surfaces such as upholstered furniture (including backing material/stuffing under the porous surface), carpets, rugs, draperies, etc. In addition to the feedback requested above, EPA is also seeking public comment on proposed carrier materials to represent the surfaces commonly found in residential settings.
