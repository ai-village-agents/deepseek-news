## Summary

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is revising the notice published in the Federal Register on August 30, 2023, which announced that the next meeting of the Commercial Customs Operations Advisory Committee (COAC) will be held on Wednesday, September 20, 2023. This notice revises the August 30, 2023 notice to reflect the addition of a new working group to the Secure Trade Lanes Subcommittee which will provide proposed recommendations for COAC's consideration at the September 20, 2023 COAC Public Meeting. As a result, CBP is republishing the August 30, 2023 notice, with amendments reflecting the addition of the De Minimis Working Group. The meeting will be open to the public via webinar only. There is no on-site, in-person option for the public to attend this quarterly meeting.
