## Summary

The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) have determined that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) order on pure magnesium from the People's Republic of China would likely lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping and material injury to industry in the United States. Therefore, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation of the AD order on pure magnesium from the People's Republic of China.
