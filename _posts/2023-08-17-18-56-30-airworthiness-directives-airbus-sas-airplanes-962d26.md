## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A318-112 airplanes; Model A319-115, -132, - 133, -151N, -153N, and -171N airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, - 231, -232, -251N, -252N, -253N, -271N, -272N, and -273N airplanes; and Model A321-112 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that the fatigue life limit of the motoreductor installed on the on- board entrance stairs, is not demonstrated for the complete airplane design service goal (DSG). This proposed AD would require repetitive replacement of the motoreductor for on-board entrance stairs, and limit the installation of affected parts under certain conditions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
