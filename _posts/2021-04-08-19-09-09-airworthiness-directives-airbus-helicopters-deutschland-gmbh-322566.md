## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (AHD) Model MBB-BK117 C-2 and MBB-BK117 D-2 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of increased control force in the collective axis. This proposed AD would require repetitive visual inspections of the main rotor actuator (MRA), as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
