## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, have received an application for an incidental take permit to take the federally listed San Bernardino kangaroo rat under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The permit application includes a proposed low-effect habitat conservation plan (HCP). In accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), we have prepared a draft low-effect screening form supporting our preliminary determination that the proposed action qualifies as a categorical exclusion under NEPA. We are accepting comments on the permit application, proposed low-effect HCP, and draft NEPA compliance documentation.
