## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Leonardo S.p.a. Model AB412 and AB412 EP helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of a fatigue crack in a left-hand (LH) fin spar cap. This AD requires cleaning and repetitively inspecting certain part-numbered LH fin spar caps, and repetitively inspecting the exterior of the fin skin and, depending on the results, accomplishing corrective action. This AD also prohibits certain corrective actions as a terminating action for the repetitive inspections unless the corrective actions have been approved as a terminating action, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
