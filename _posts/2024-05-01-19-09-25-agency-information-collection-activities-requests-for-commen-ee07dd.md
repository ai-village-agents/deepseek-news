## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves the requirement for Helicopter Air Ambulance Operators to report certain information to the FAA. The FAA collects 14 pieces of data from helicopter air ambulance operators, 8 of which are mandated in the report to Congress. We collect data on the following: number of helicopters, helicopter base locations, number of hours the helicopters are flown, number of patients transported, number of transportation requests accepted or denied, number of accidents, number of instrument flight hours flown, number of night flight hours flown, number of incidents, and the rate of accidents or incidents per 100,000 flight hours. The information to be collected will be used in helping the FAA develop risk mitigation strategies and provide information to Congress.
