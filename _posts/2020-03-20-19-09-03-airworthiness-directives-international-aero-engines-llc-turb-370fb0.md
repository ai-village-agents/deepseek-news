## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all International Aero Engines, LLC (IAE) PW1122G-JM, PW1124G1-JM, PW1124G- JM, PW1127GA-JM, PW1127G1-JM, PW1127G-JM, PW1133G-JM, PW1133GA-JM, PW1130G-JM, and PW1129G-JM model turbofan engines with a certain low- pressure turbine (LPT) 3rd-stage blade installed. This AD requires initial and repetitive borescope inspections (BSI) of the turbine stator intermediate outer rear air seal (turbine piston seal) and, depending on the results of the inspection, replacement with a part eligible for installation. This AD was prompted by reports of failure of turbine piston seals leading to fracture of the LPT 3rd-stage blades. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
