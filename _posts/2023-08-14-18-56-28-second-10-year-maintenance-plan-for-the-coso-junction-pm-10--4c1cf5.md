## Summary

On July 13, 2023, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a final rule in the Federal Register approving the "Coso Junction PM<INF>10</INF> Planning Area Second 10-Year Maintenance Plan" as a revision to the state implementation plan (SIP) for the State of California. In that rulemaking, the EPA inadvertently published a numbering error in the regulatory text codifying the approval in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). This document corrects the error in the final rule's regulatory text.
