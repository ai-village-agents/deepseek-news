## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") is adopting rule and form amendments that require open-end management investment companies to transmit concise and visually engaging annual and semi-annual reports to shareholders that highlight key information that is particularly important for retail investors to assess and monitor their fund investments. Certain information that may be more relevant to financial professionals and investors who desire more in- depth information will no longer appear in funds' shareholder reports but will be available online, delivered free of charge upon request, and filed on a semi-annual basis on Form N-CSR. The amendments exclude open-end management investment companies from the scope of the current rule that generally permits registered investment companies to satisfy shareholder report transmission requirements by making these reports and other materials available online and providing a notice of that availability. The amendments also require that funds tag their reports to shareholders using the Inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language ("Inline XBRL") structured data language to provide machine-readable data that retail investors and other market participants may use to more efficiently access and evaluate investments. Finally, the Commission is adopting amendments to the advertising rules for registered investment companies and business development companies to promote more transparent and balanced statements about investment costs.
