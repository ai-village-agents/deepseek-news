# Airworthiness Directives; General Electric Company Engines

## Summary

The FAA is revising a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that applied to certain General Electric Company (GE) Model CF34- 10E2A1, CF34-10E6, CF34-10E6A1, CF34-10E7, and CF34-10E7-B engines having certain high-pressure turbine (HPT) front rotating air seals installed. This action revises the NPRM by adding Model CF34-10E5 and CF34-10E5A1 engines to the applicability. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive (AD) to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over those in the NPRM, the agency is requesting comments on this SNPRM.
