## Summary

This is a notice of intent to award supplemental funding to the SPRC recipient funded in FY 2020 under Funding Opportunity Announcement SM-20-011. This is to inform the public that the SAMHSA is supporting an administrative supplement up to $5.429 million, which is consistent with the initial award for one-year to the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. This recipient was funded in FY 2020 with a project end date of November 30, 2025. This supplement will provide support to the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention to conduct an evaluation project for populations at higher risk of suicide in support of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline's 988 efforts. Additionally, SPRC will provide training and technical assistance to increase the capacity of existing 988 call centers to help Tribal callers and to build the capacity of Tribal crisis hotline services to qualify to join the 988 network. This is not a formal request for application. Assistance will only be provided to the Suicide Prevention Resource Center (SPRC) recipient, the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, based on the receipt of a satisfactory application and associated budget that is approved by a review group.
