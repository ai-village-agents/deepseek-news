## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 757 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of several occurrences of a power transfer unit (PTU) control valve that failed to open when commanded. This AD requires installing new relays and changing certain wire bundles leading to the PTU control valve. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
