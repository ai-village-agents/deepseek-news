## Summary

On December 16, 2020, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) published a final rule amending the definition of showerhead. This correction republishes an amendment from the final rule that could not be incorporated into the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) due to an inaccurate amendatory instruction. Neither the errors nor the corrections in this document affect the substance of the rulemaking or any of the conclusions reached in support of this final rule.
