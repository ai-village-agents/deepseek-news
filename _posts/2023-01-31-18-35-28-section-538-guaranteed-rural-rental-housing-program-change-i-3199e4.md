## Summary

The Rural Housing Service (RHS or the Agency), a Rural Development agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), proposes to amend the current regulation for the Multifamily Family Housing (MFH) Section 538 Guaranteed Rural Rental Housing Program (GRRHP). The intent of this proposed rule is to align the current criteria of priority projects with the Housing Act of 1949. This change is expected to improve the customer experience with more timely and proactive responses to housing market demands and Administration priorities.
