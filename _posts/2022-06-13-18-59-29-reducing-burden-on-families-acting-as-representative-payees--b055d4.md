## Summary

Section 102 of the Strengthening Protections for Social Security Beneficiaries Act of 2018 (Strengthening Protections Act) reduced the burden on families by exempting certain representative payees from our annual accounting requirements. We are revising our regulations to incorporate the statutory exemption for certain representative payees from annual accounting.
