## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 777 airplanes. This AD was prompted by high electrical resistance within the gust suppression sensor (GSS) transorb modules due to corrosion on the transorb module threads. This AD requires disconnecting the connectors and capping and stowing the wires that had been attached to the affected transorb modules. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
