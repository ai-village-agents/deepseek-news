## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 767 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of cracks on the forward entry door and forward service door cutout aft lower corner fuselage skin and bear strap. This AD requires repetitive inspections for cracking at the affected area, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
