## Summary

DoD published a request for information in the Federal Register that provided an opportunity for the public to submit issues that have an impact on Service members and their families, where state governments are the primary agents for making positive change. Each year, DoD selects State Policy Priorities for states to consider that represent barriers resulting from the transience and uncertainty of military life. For example, DoD has asked states to consider remedies to improve school transitions for children in active duty military families to overcome problems with records transfer, class and course placement, qualifying for extra-curricular activities, and fulfilling graduation requirements. The DoD will consider the public submissions in setting those priorities.
