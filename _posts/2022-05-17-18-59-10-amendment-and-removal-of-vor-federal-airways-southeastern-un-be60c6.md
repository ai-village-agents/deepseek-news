## Summary

In the proposed rule for this action, the FAA proposed to amend 11 VHF Omnidirectional Radar (VOR) Federal airways and remove 6 airways in support of the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) project in the southeastern United States. However, due to need for additional coordination with the Department of Defense (DoD), modifications of 9 airways will be made at a later date. Eight airways remain in this rule with some changes from the proposed route structure.
