## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking interim final action to provide for the temporary use of incineration units subject to commercial and industrial solid waste incinerator (CISWI) regulations during disaster recovery. Currently, only other solid waste incinerators (OSWI) are authorized to combust debris from a disaster or emergency on a temporary basis without having to comply with applicable Clean Air Act (CAA) section 129 requirements. We are also authorizing such temporary use for incinerators (including air curtain incinerators (ACI)) subject to CISWI regulations by adding temporary-use provisions that essentially mirror those in the OSWI regulations to existing Federal CISWI rule subparts. The EPA is requesting comments on all aspects of this interim final rule and will consider all comments received after the conclusion of the comment period.
