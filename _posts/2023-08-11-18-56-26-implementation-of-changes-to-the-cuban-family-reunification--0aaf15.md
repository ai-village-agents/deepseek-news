## Summary

This notice announces that the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) has authorized updates to modernize Cuban Family Reunification Parole (CFRP). CFRP provides a lawful, safe, and orderly pathway for certain Cubans to seek parole into the United States, allowing them to reunite with family as they wait for their immigrant visas to become available so they may apply to adjust status to lawful permanent resident (LPR). The Secretary has authorized these updates to CFRP in light of technological advancements and process efficiencies created since the CFRP's inception in 2007. Every step of the updated process will be completed online with the exception of a medical exam by a panel physician and the parole determination made upon arrival at an interior U.S. port of entry (POE).
