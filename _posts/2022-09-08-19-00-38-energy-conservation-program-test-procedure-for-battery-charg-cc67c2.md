## Summary

In this final rule, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") amends the existing test procedures for battery chargers to reorganize certain subsections, clarify symbology and references, correct an incorrect cross reference and section title, update the list of battery chemistries, and terminate an existing test procedure waiver because the covered subject models have been discontinued. This final rule also establishes in new appendix Y1 a new a test procedure for battery chargers that expands coverage to include inductive wireless battery chargers and establishes associated definitions and test provisions; establishes a new test procedure approach that relies on separate metrics for active mode, standby mode, and off mode; and updates the EPS selection criteria. The new test procedure Y1 will be used for the evaluation and issuance of updated efficiency standards, as well as to determine compliance with the updated standards, should such standards be established.
