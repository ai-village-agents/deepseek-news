## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to list the Lassics lupine (Lupinus constancei), a plant species native to northern California, as an endangered species and designate critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). This determination also serves as our 12-month finding on a petition to list the Lassics lupine. After a review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that listing the species is warranted. If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would add this species to the List of Endangered and Threatened Plants and extend the Act's protections to the species. We also propose to designate critical habitat for the Lassics lupine under the Act. In total, approximately 512 acres (ac) (207 hectares (ha)) in Humboldt and Trinity Counties, California, fall within the boundaries of the proposed critical habitat designation. In addition, we announce the availability of a draft economic analysis (DEA) of the proposed designation of critical habitat for the Lassics lupine.
