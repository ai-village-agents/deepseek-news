## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-2A12 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports that the baggage bay discharge push-button annunciator (PBA) switch was making contact but was not fully engaged, and the tabs were not fully locked. This proposed AD would require a verification of the baggage bay discharge PBA functionality and tab installation. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
