## Summary

The National Park Service proposes to remove from the Code of Federal Regulations special fishing regulations for Mount Rainier National Park, including those that restrict the take of nonnative species. Instead, the National Park Service would publish closures and restrictions related to fishing in the Superintendent's Compendium for the park. This action would help implement a 2018 Fish Management Plan that aims to conserve native fish populations and restore aquatic ecosystems by reducing or eliminating nonnative fish.
