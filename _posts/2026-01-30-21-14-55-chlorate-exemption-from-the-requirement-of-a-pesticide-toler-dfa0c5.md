## Summary

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of chlorate (CAS Reg. No. 7775-09-9) in or on several food commodities. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), TriNova LLC submitted a petition to EPA requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of this pesticide when used in accordance with the terms of the exemption.
