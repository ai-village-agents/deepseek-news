## Summary

This notice serves as a complementary document to the Economic Growth Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act: Implementation of National Standards for the Physical Inspection of Real Estate (NSPIRE) rule published May 11, 2023. The NSPIRE rule provided that HUD's Office of Community Planning and Development (CPD) would publish an additional notice on the NSPIRE Standards for the Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS (HOPWA) program. HUD is providing implementation guidance on NSPIRE physical inspection standards for the HOPWA program to accompany the NSPIRE rule through this notice. This notice provides guidance to HOPWA grantees on how to inspect HOPWA-assisted units for compliance with the NSPIRE rule, and how to ensure corrections are made, if needed. This notice also provides guidance on statutory requirements that require grantees to ensure each dwelling unit assisted under the HOPWA program contains installed qualifying carbon monoxide (CO) alarms or detectors and smoke alarms.
