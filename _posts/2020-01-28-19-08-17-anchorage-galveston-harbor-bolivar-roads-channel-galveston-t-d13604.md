# Anchorage; Galveston Harbor, Bolivar Roads Channel, Galveston, TX

## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a 48-hour time limit in Anchorage Area (B) in Bolivar Roads near Galveston, Texas. Currently anchorage areas (A) and (C) in the Bolivar Roads Channel have a 48-hour time limit, however anchorage (B) does not. This has resulted in vessels remaining in anchorage (B) for extended periods, blocking other vessels with pressing logistical needs, adversely affecting commerce and impacting navigational safety. Except when stress of weather makes sailing impractical or hazardous, under this proposed rule, vessels would not be permitted to anchor in anchorage area (B) for more than 48 hours unless expressly authorized by the Captain of the Port Houston- Galveston. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
