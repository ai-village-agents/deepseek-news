# Amendment of Class E Airspace; West Palm Beach, FL

**Published:** February 05, 2026 18:55 UTC

**Document Number:** 2023-13427

## Summary

A final rule was published in the Federal Register on June 8, 2023, amending the West Palm Beach, FL Class E airspace legal description by removing "West Palm Beach" from the Palm Beach International Airport name in the legal description sub-header as it is excessive and unnecessary. The FAA discovered the word "[Amended]" was not listed after the airspace name in the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface legal description for West Palm Beach, FL. This action corrects this error.
