## Summary

NMFS proposes to implement management measures described in a framework action under the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP), as prepared by the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) Fishery Management Council (Council). If implemented, this proposed rule would modify the ratios used to set the state- specific red snapper private angling component annual catch limits (ACLs) for Alabama, Florida, and Mississippi and would modify each of these state's private angling component ACLs based on the new ratios. In addition, this proposed rule would modify the stock ACL for gray snapper in the Gulf exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The purposes of this proposed rule are to update state specific private angling component calibration ratios and ACLs to provide a more accurate estimate of state landings for red snapper management and to revise gray snapper catch limits with updated scientific information to continue to achieve optimum yield (OY) for the stock.
