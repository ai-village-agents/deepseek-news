## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-16-06, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A330-200, A330- 200 Freighter, A330-300, and A330-900 series airplanes; and all Model A340-200 and A340-300 series airplanes. AD 2022-16-06 requires modifying the Trimmable Horizontal Stabilizer Actuator (THSA) installation, implementing the electrical load sensing device (ELSD) wiring provisions, and installing and activating the ELSD. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-16-06, it has been determined that the required actions cannot be accomplished on certain airplanes, and additional instructions and corrections have been developed. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2022-16-06 with certain revised procedures and would require additional work for certain airplanes, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
