## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering issuance of an amendment to Possession Only License (POL) No. DPR-73, issued to TMI-2 Solutions, LLC (TMI-2 Solutions) for Three Mile Island Station, Unit No. 2 (TMI-2). The NRC received and is considering approval of one amendment request. Pursuant to NRC regulations, TMI-2 Solutions proposes an amendment to the POL for TMI-2. This proposed license amendment request, upon approval, would revise the POL to replace the reference to site physical security, guard training and qualification, and safeguards contingency plans maintained by Unit 1 with a TMI-2 Site Security plan compliant with NRC regulations. For this amendment request, the NRC proposes to determine that it involves no significant hazards consideration (NSHC). Because the amendment request contains sensitive unclassified non-safeguards information (SUNSI), an order imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI for contention preparation by persons who file a hearing request or petition for leave to intervene.
