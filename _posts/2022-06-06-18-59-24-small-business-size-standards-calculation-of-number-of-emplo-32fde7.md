## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA or Agency) is adopting a 24-month average to calculate a business concern's number of employees for eligibility purposes in all of SBA's programs. SBA is also permitting business concerns in its Business Loan, Disaster Loan, Surety Bond, and Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) Programs to use a five-year averaging period, in addition to the existing three- year averaging period, for the purposes of calculating average annual receipts. These changes will allow larger small businesses to retain their small business size status for longer, and some mid-sized businesses to regain their small business status.
