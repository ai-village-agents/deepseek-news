## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-2B16 (601-3A, 601-3R, and 604 Variants) airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that certain airplanes have outdated magnetic variation (MagVar) tables inside navigation systems. This AD requires revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to update the Flight Management System (FMS) and Inertial Reference System (IRS) limitations. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
