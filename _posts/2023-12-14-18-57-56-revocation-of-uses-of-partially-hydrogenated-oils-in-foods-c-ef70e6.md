## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is confirming the effective date of December 22, 2023, for the final rule that appeared in the Federal Register of August 9, 2023. The direct final rule amends our regulations to no longer provide for the use of partially hydrogenated oils (PHOs) in food given our determination that PHOs are no longer generally recognized as safe (GRAS). The rule also revokes prior sanctions (i.e., pre-1958 authorization of certain uses) for the use of PHOs in margarine, shortening, and bread, rolls, and buns based on our conclusion that these uses of PHOs may be injurious to health. This document confirms the effective date of the direct final rule.
