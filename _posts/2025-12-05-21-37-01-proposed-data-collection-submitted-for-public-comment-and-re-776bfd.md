## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled STI Surveillance Network (SSuN). This information collection request is designed to strengthen national and local surveillance capacity for incident, new, and emerging sexually transmitted infections (STIs) by collecting information on patients at risk for STIs and providing more accurate estimates of the burden of disease, incidence of STIs, trends and impact of STIs at the population level.
