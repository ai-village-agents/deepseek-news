## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC, Commission, or Agency) proposes to modify an existing system of records, FCC-2, Business Contacts and Certifications, subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. This action is necessary to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act to publish in the Federal Register notice of the existence and character of records maintained by the Agency. The Commission uses this system to collect and maintain points of contact and to ensure compliance with FCC rules through certifications of information provided to the Commission. This modification expands the purposes, categories of individuals, and record source categories of this system of records to include public interest organizations, nonprofit organizations, government organizations, international organizations, and other non-business entities that participate in FCC proceedings or are included in FCC programs and modifies two routine uses.
