## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is announcing the availability of the final risk evaluations under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for Butyl Benzyl Phthalate (BBP) (CARSN 85-68-7), Dibutyl Phthalate (DBP) (CASRN 84-74-2), Dicyclohexyl Phthalate (DCHP) (CASRN 84-61-7), Diethylhexyl Phthalate (DEHP) (CASRN 117-81-7), and Diisobutyl Phthalate (DIBP) (CASRN 84-69-5). The purpose of conducting risk evaluations under TSCA is to determine whether a chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, without consideration of costs or non-risk factors, including unreasonable risk to potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations identified as relevant to the risk evaluation by EPA, under the conditions of use. EPA used the best available science to prepare these final risk evaluations, and determined, based on the weight of scientific evidence, that BBP, DBP, DCHP, DEHP, and DIBP pose unreasonable risk to human health and/or the environment driven by specific conditions of use. Under TSCA, EPA must initiate risk management actions to address the unreasonable risk.
