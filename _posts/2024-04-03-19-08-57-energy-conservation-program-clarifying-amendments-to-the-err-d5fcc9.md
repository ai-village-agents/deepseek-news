## Summary

The Department of Energy ("DOE" or "the Department") is amending its procedures for providing public input on possible corrections of errors contained in the regulatory text of energy conservation standard final rules. In this final rule, DOE modifies certain aspects of these procedures to clarify and reflect the Department's intent regarding the error correction process that it previously created. The procedures as amended in this final rule do not in any way restrict, limit, diminish, or eliminate the Secretary's discretion to determine whether to establish or amend an energy conservation standard, or to determine the appropriate level at which to amend or establish any energy conservation standard.
