## Summary

This action proposes to amend Class D airspace and Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface in Lawrenceville, GA. This action would update the airport's name in both the Class D and E airspace to Gwinnett County/Briscoe Field. In addition, this action would amend the Class D airspace by creating an extension to the southwest. The Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface would be amended by increasing the radius and eliminating the extension to the east. Also, this action would eliminate the Gwinnett Non-directional Beacon (NDB) from the legal description. This action would also make an editorial change replacing the term Airport/Facility Directory with the term Chart Supplement in the legal description of the Class D airspace. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.
