## Summary

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA or Department) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS or the Agency) amends its Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, regulations to prohibit undue prejudice and unjust discrimination against individuals on a prohibited basis unrelated to the quality of the service or product provided. The rule also identifies retaliatory practices that interfere with lawful communications, assertion of rights, and associated participation, among other protected activities, as unjust discrimination prohibited by the law. Finally, the rule identifies deceptive practices that violate the Packers and Stockyards Act with respect to contract formation, contract performance, contract termination, and contract refusal. The purpose of this rule is to promote inclusive competition and market integrity in the livestock, meats, poultry, and live poultry markets.
