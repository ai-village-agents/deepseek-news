## Summary

We are advising the public that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has received a petition from Bayer U.S.-Crop Science seeking a determination of nonregulated status for maize (corn) event MON 95379 that has been developed using genetic engineering to produce two insecticidal proteins to protect against feeding damage caused by target lepidopteran pests. We are making the petition available for review and comment to help us identify potential issues and impacts that we may determine should be considered in our evaluation of the petition.
