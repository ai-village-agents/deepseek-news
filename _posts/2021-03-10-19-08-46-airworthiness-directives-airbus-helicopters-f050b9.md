## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model AS350B, AS350BA, AS350B1, AS350B2, AS350B3, and AS350D helicopters; Model AS355E, AS355F, AS355F1, AS355F2, AS355N, and AS355NP helicopters; and Model EC130 B4 and EC130 T2 helicopters. This AD requires a one-time inspection to verify the presence and correct installation of the main rotor mast (MRM) upper bearing retaining rings, a repetitive inspection of the sealant bead on the MRM for damage, and corrective actions if necessary. This AD was prompted by a report of a missing retaining ring of the inner race of the MRM upper bearing. The actions of this AD are intended to address an unsafe condition on these products.
