## Summary

In accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), the Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) (collectively, the "agencies") may not conduct or sponsor, and the respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), of which the agencies are members, has approved the Board's publication, on behalf of the agencies, for public comment of a proposal to revise and extend the Country Exposure Report for U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks (FFIEC 019), which is currently an approved collection of information. The agencies are proposing revisions to the FFIEC 019 that would take effect March 31, 2022, as discussed in the Section II, Current Actions, below. In determining whether to modify the proposed collection of information, the agencies will consider all comments received. As required by the PRA, the Board would then publish a second Federal Register notice for a 30-day comment period and submit the final FFIEC 019 clearance package to OMB for review and approval.
