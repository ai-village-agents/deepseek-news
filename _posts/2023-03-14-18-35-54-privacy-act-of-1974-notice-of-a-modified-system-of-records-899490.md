## Summary

GSA proposes to modify a system of records subject to the Privacy Act of 1974. GSA is modifying the notice to update the system name to "Office of the Chief Financial Officer's (OCFO) Imaging/ Workflow Solution". It is a subsystem within the Ancillary Corporate Applications (ACA) at GSA. OCFO's Imaging/Workflow Solution allows users in the Payroll Services Branch, Accounts Payable and customer agencies to annotate metadata to scanned images, and search and view documents (i.e., invoices, payroll, property records, deeds, transfers) that have been scanned/stored.
