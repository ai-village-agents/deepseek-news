## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A321-251N, A321-251NX, A321-252NX, A321-253N, A321-253NX, and A321-271NX airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that the quick release pin that is installed on the upper attachment of certain Smart HS-L41 and Smart HS-L42 lavatories is too short to lock on the bracket. This AD requires replacement of the quick release pin installed on the upper attachment of affected lavatories, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
