## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve four permitting rules submitted as a revision to the San Diego County Air Pollution Control District (SDAPCD or "District") portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern the District's New Source Review (NSR) permitting program for new and modified sources of air pollution under section 110(a)(2)(C) and part D of title I of the Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act"). This action will update the District's applicable SIP with rules revised to address a deficiency identified in a previous limited disapproval action. We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action. Elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, we are making an interim final determination that will defer the imposition of CAA sanctions associated with our previous limited disapproval action. This action also proposes to revise regulatory text to clarify that San Diego County is not subject to the Federal Implementation Plan related to protection of visibility.
