## Summary

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission's (Commission or CPSC) mandatory rule, Safety Standard for Bassinets and Cradles, incorporates by reference ASTM F2194-13, Standard Consumer Safety Specification for Bassinets and Cradles, with modifications. ASTM revised F2194-13 several times between 2013 and 2022, but did not notify the Commission of those revisions. ASTM has again revised the voluntary standard for bassinets and cradles, publishing ASTM F2194- 22[egr]1, and the Commission has received notice of this revision. CPSC seeks comment on whether ASTM F2194-22[egr]1 improves the safety of the consumer product covered by the standard.
