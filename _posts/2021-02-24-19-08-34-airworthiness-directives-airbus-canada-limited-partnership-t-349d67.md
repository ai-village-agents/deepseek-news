## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD- 500-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of deficiencies in the primary flight control computer (PFCC) and remote electronics unit (REU) software. This proposed AD would require installation of a software update to correct deficiencies in the PFCC and REU software, as specified in a Transport Canada Civil Aviation (TCCA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
