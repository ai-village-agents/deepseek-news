## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500-1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of in-service findings of corrosion on the flange of the main landing gear (MLG) lower spindle pin. This AD requires repetitive inspections of the left and right MLG lower spindle pins to detect corrosion, and applicable repair or replacement if necessary, as specified in a Transport Canada Civil Aviation (TCCA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
