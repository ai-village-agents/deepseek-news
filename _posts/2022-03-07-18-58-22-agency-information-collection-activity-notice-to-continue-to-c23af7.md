## Summary

The U.S. Department of Transportation (US DOT) BTS published a 60-day comment period Notice 86 FR 58391 on October 21, 2021 seeking public input to continue the collection of barrier failure data. Barrier Failure Reporting in Oil and Gas Operations on the Outer Continental Shelf is a component of BTS's SafeOCS data sharing framework, that provides a trusted, proactive means for the oil and gas industry to report sensitive and proprietary safety information, and to identify early warnings of safety problems and potential issues by uncovering hidden, at-risk conditions not previously exposed through analysis of reportable equipment failures and incidents. BTS received no comments during the 60-day public comment period.
