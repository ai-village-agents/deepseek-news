## Summary

The Forest Service (Forest Service or Agency), United States Department of Agriculture, published a proposed rule in the Federal Register on March 9, 2023, initiating a 60-day comment period on the proposed rule to amend its special use regulations to update the processing and monitoring fee schedules based on current Agency costs; to provide for recovery of costs associated with processing special use proposals, as well as applications; and to remove the exemption for commercial recreation special use applications and authorizations that involve 50 hours or less to process or monitor. In addition, the Forest Service is proposing to amend its special use regulations to increase the strict liability limit consistent with the strict liability limit established by the United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, and to expressly provide for requiring holders of a special use authorization to obtain insurance, as needed. The comment period for the original document closed May 8, 2023. The Agency is reopening the comment period for an additional 30 days from the date of publication of this document.
