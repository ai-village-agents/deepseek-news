## Summary

As required by Reese's Law, to eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury from ingestion of button cell or coin batteries by children 6 years old and younger, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) proposes a rule to establish performance requirements for battery compartments on consumer products that contain, or are designed to use, one or more button cell or coin batteries. The proposed rule also requires warning labels on the packaging of button cell or coin batteries, as well as on the packaging, battery compartments, and accompanying instructions and manuals of consumer products containing button cell or coin batteries. In addition to implementing Reese's Law, the proposed rule requires manufacturers and importers of button cell or coin batteries, and consumer products containing such batteries, to notify consumers of performance and technical data related to the safety of such batteries at the point of sale, both online and in stores. If the rule is finalized, consumer products subject to the rule must be tested and certified as compliant with the rule.
