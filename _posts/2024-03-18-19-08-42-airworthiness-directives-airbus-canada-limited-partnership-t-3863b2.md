## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500- 1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of mechanical wear damage on the motive flow fuel-feed tubes that were secured by bonding clamps and clamp blocks inside the collector tank. This AD requires repetitive operational checks of the gravity cross flow shut-off valve and, for certain airplanes, a one-time inspection of the motive flow fuel-feed tubes at the clamp blocks location, and corrective action if necessary, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
