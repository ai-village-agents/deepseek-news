## Summary

The Las Vegas Field Office announces the temporary closures of certain public lands under its administration. The off-highway vehicle (OHV) race area in Laughlin, Nevada, is used by OHV recreationists, and the temporary closures are needed to limit access to the race area and to minimize the risk of potential collisions with spectators and racers during two events: The 2022 Laughlin Desert Classic and the 2022 Southern Nevada Off Road Enthusiasts (SNORE) Laughlin Race.
