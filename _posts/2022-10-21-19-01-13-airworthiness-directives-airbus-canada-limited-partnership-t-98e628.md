## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500- 1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by the discovery that overwing emergency exit door (OWEED) handle covers were difficult to open on some airplanes. This AD requires replacing the existing OWEED handle cover brackets with newly designed OWEED handle cover brackets and installing placards regarding this replacement, as specified in a Transport Canada Civil Aviation (TCCA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
