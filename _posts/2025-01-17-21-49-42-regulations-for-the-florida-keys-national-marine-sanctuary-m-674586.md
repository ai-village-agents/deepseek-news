## Summary

As part of its Restoration Blueprint initiative, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is issuing final regulations for the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS or sanctuary) that will expand the boundary of the sanctuary, update sanctuary-wide regulations, update the individual marine zones and their associated regulations, and revise the sanctuary's terms of designation. NOAA is also finalizing a revised management plan and final environmental impact statement (EIS) as part of this action. The final rule describes how NOAA will work to improve the condition of resources in FKNMS through a series of regulatory measures designed to reduce threats and, where appropriate, restore coral reefs, seagrasses, and other important habitats. The intended effect of this final rule is to manage and protect the living and heritage resources of FKNMS for the benefit of the public.
