# Energy Conservation Program: Test Procedure for Commercial Warm Air Furnaces

## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") proposes to amend the test procedures for commercial warm air furnaces ("CWAFs") to incorporate the latest versions of the industry standards that are currently incorporated by reference. DOE also proposes to establish a new metric, Thermal Efficiency Two ("TE2"), and corresponding test procedure. Use of the newly proposed test procedure would become mandatory at such time as compliance with amended energy conservation standards based on TE2 is required, should DOE adopt such standards. DOE also proposes additional specifications for CWAFs with multiple vent hoods or small-diameter vent hoods. DOE is seeking comment from interested parties on the proposal.
