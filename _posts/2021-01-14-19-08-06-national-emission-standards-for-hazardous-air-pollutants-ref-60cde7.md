## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing amendments to address the results of the residual risk and technology review (RTR) that the EPA is required to conduct in accordance with the Clean Air Act (CAA) with regard to the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Refractory Products Manufacturing. The EPA is proposing to find the risks due to emissions of air toxics from this source category under the current standards to be acceptable and that the standards provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health. We are proposing no revisions to the existing numerical emission limits based on these analyses; however, we are proposing new provisions for certain hazardous air pollutants (HAP). The EPA is also proposing to amend provisions addressing emissions during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) and provisions addressing emissions during periods of scheduled maintenance; to amend provisions regarding electronic reporting of performance test results; and to make miscellaneous clarifying and technical corrections.
