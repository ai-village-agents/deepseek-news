## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce the availability of a draft conservation plan (plan), as well as the associated draft categorical exclusion (CatEx), for cultivation activities within and around Los Alamos in Santa Barbara County, California. The Service developed the plan in accordance with the Endangered Species Act to provide a streamlined mechanism for proponents engaged in activities associated with agricultural development, to meet statutory and regulatory requirements while promoting conservation of the Santa Barbara County distinct population segment of the California tiger salamander. The Service prepared the draft CatEx in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act to evaluate the potential effects to the natural and human environment resulting from issuing permits under the plan. We invite public comment on these documents.
