## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) AD 2017- 03-02 for certain Rolls-Royce, Deutschland Ltd. & Co. KG RB211 Trent 768-60, 772-60, and 772B-60 model turbofan engines. AD 2017-03-02 required initial and repetitive ultrasonic inspections (UIs) of the affected low-pressure (LP) compressor blades. This AD requires initial and repetitive UIs of the affected LP compressor blades and, depending on the results of the UIs, their replacement with a part eligible for installation. This AD was prompted by LP compressor blade partial airfoil release events. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
