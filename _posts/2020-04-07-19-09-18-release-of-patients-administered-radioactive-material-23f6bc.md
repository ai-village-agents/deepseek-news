In addition, the guide includes a new section on "Death of a Patient Following Radiopharmaceutical or Implants Administrations," as well as requirements for recordkeeping. Also, Table 3, "Activities of Radiopharmaceuticals That Require Instructions and Records When Administered to Patients Who Are Breastfeeding an Infant or Child," has been revised.
