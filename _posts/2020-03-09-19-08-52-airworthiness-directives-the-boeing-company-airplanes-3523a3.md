# Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-03-06, which applies to certain The Boeing Company Model 737-300, -400, and -500 series airplanes. AD 2019-03-06 requires installing lanyard assemblies to the passenger service units (PSUs) and, for certain airplanes, on the life vest panels. Since AD 2019-03-06 was issued, the FAA has determined that additional actions are necessary for five airplanes. This proposed AD would retain the requirements of AD 2019-03-06 and require installation of lanyard assemblies to the life vest panels on those five airplanes. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
