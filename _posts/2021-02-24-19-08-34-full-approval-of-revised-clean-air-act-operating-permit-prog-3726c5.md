## Summary

With this direct final rule, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the "Agency") is promulgating full approval of the revised and recodified North Dakota operating permit program for stationary sources subject to title V of the Clean Air Act (CAA or the "Act"). On August 6, 2018, North Dakota submitted a request for approval of its revisions to the North Dakota operating permit program (the "title V program") for stationary sources subject to title V of the CAA and recodification of the State's title V program under a new title of the North Dakota Administrative Code (NDAC). The EPA determined that the revised and recodified program substantially met the requirements of title V of the Act and Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) but was not fully approvable because the State law provisions for judicial review were not consistent with program requirements found in the CFR. Thus, EPA issued an interim approval of North Dakota's title V program. North Dakota has made the changes required for full program approval. Accordingly, the EPA is taking this action in accordance with the CAA and CFR title V program approval requirements. This is a direct final action because the action is deemed noncontroversial and we do not expect adverse comments.
