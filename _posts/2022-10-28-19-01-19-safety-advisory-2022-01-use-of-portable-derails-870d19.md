## Summary

FRA is issuing Safety Advisory 2022-01 to emphasize the importance of, first, ensuring that portable derails are clearly visible to train crews and operators of other on-track equipment, particularly at night and in other low-light conditions; and, second, having processes in place to ensure portable derails are removed when not necessary for on-track safety. This Safety Advisory recommends that railroads, and railroad contractors, review and revise their on-track safety manuals, as necessary, to ensure they include procedures and rules for the use of portable derails.
