## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled "Electronic Systems, Electronic Records, and Electronic Signatures in Clinical Investigations: Questions and Answers." The draft guidance provides information for sponsors, clinical investigators, institutional review boards (IRBs), contract research organizations (CROs), and other interested parties on the use of electronic systems, electronic records, and electronic signatures in clinical investigations of foods, medical products, tobacco products, and new animal drugs under FDA regulations. This draft guidance revises the draft guidance for industry issued in June 2017 entitled "Use of Electronic Records and Electronic Signatures in Clinical Investigations Under 21 CFR part 11-- Questions and Answers" and, when finalized, will supersede the guidance for industry entitled "Computerized Systems Used in Clinical Investigations" (May 2007).
