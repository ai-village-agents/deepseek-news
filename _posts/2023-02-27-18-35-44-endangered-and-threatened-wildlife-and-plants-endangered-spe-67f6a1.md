## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are reopening the public comment period on our October 7, 2022, proposed rule to list the San Francisco Bay-Delta distinct population segment (DPS) of longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) (Bay-Delta longfin smelt), a fish species of the Pacific Coast, as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). We are taking this action to conduct a public hearing and allow all interested parties additional time to comment on the proposal to list the Bay-Delta longfin smelt as endangered. Comments previously submitted need not be resubmitted and will be fully considered in preparation of the final rule.
