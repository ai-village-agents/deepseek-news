## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) debarring Robert Lance Shuffert for a period of 5 years from importing or offering for import any drug into the United States. FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Shuffert was convicted of one felony count under Federal law for, with the intent to defraud and mislead, causing a drug to be misbranded while it was held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce. The factual basis supporting Mr. Shuffert's conviction, as described below, is conduct relating to the importation into the United States of any drug or controlled substance. Mr. Shuffert was given notice of the proposed debarment and an opportunity to request a hearing to show why he should not be debarred. As of March 4, 2024 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Mr. Shuffert had not responded. Mr. Shuffert's failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this matter.
