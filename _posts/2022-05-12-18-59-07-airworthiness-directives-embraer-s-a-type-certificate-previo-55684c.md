## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Embraer S.A. Model ERJ 190-300, and -400 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of premature failures of the alternating current motor pump (ACMP) 3A at hydraulic system #3 due to excessive wear of the ACMP tail bearing. This AD requires repetitive replacement of the hydraulic system ACMP 3A having a certain part number with a serviceable part, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
