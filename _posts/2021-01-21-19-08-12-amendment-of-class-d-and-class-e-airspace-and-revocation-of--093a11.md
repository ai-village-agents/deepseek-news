## Summary

This action amends the Class D and Class E airspace and revokes the Class E airspace designated as an extension to Class D and Class E surface areas at Muskegon County Airport, Muskegon, MI. This action is the result of an airspace review caused by the decommissioning of the Muskegon VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) navigation aid as part of the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program. The geographic coordinates of the airport are also being updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
