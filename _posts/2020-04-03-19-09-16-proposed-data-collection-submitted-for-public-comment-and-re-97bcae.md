## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Possession, Use, and Transfer of Select Agents and Toxins (42 CFR part 73). This information collection intends to support the Public Health Safety and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 and ensure select agents or toxins are managed appropriately to prevent any threats to human health or safety. Data will be used to fulfill the requirements promulgated by HHS under this part and also subject to corresponding regulations promulgated by USDA.
