## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves Certificated Training Centers. Operators pay Certificated Training Centers to provide training to their employees, typically pilots, on different types of equipment if training is not done in house. The information to be collected is necessary because it allows aviation safety inspectors (operations) to review and to provide surveillance to training centers to ensure compliance with airman training, testing, and certification requirements specified in other parts of the regulations. If the information were not collected, inspectors would not be able to determine if airmen who are clients are being trained, checked or tested to meet the safety standards established in other parts of the regulations. To date, FAA inspectors have used the information collected to determine and assess regulatory compliance during routine program surveillance.
