## Summary

The Department of the Air Force (DAF) is issuing this Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to assess the potential environmental impacts associated with the beddown of the B-21 Main Operating Base 2 (MOB 2)/Main Operating Base 3 (MOB 3) at Dyess Air Force Base (AFB), Texas or Whiteman AFB, Missouri. The EIS will evaluate the potential impacts of the DAF's beddown proposal associated with infrastructure construction, demolition, renovations, additional personnel, and changes in aircraft operations at Dyess AFB and Whiteman AFB, including associated airspace. The B-21 will eventually replace existing B-1 and B-2 bomber aircraft.
