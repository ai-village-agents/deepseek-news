## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-14-14, which applies to all Airbus SAS Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2017-14-14 requires repetitive inspections for cracking in the cabin floor beam junction at certain fuselage frame locations, and repair if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2017-14-14, further analysis determined that the compliance times for the inspections must also be based on flight hours. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2017-14-14, and would require revised compliance times and add a provision for optional modifications, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
