## Summary

The NCUA Board (Board) is requesting comment on changes to the methodology it uses to determine how it apportions operating fees charged to Federal credit unions (FCUs). The Board uses operating fees to fund part of the NCUA's annual budget. In this notice, the Board proposes to change the exemption threshold below which Federal Credit Unions would not be required to pay the operating fee and proposes to establish a process to update the exemption threshold in future years based on the credit union system's annual asset growth.
