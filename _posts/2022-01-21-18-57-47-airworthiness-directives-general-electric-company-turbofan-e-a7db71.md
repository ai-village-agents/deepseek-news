## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all General Electric Company (GE) CF6-80C2A1, CF6-80C2A2, CF6-80C2A3, CF6- 80C2A5, CF6-80C2A5F, and CF6-80C2A8 model turbofan engines with an installed left-hand rear mount link assembly, part number (P/N) 1846M23G01. This AD was prompted by the manufacturer reducing the life limit for the affected left-hand rear mount link assembly. This AD requires revising the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the existing engine maintenance manual and the operator's existing approved continuous airworthiness maintenance program (CAMP). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
