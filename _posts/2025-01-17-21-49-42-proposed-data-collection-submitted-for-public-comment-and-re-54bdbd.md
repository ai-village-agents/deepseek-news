## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Healthcare Prevention and Response Workforce Development for Health Departments. The proposed workforce development evaluations will be used to assess whether the CDC-developed workforce development activities are reaching the intended audience and achieving the intended goal of strengthening public health workforce capacity to prevent and respond to Healthcare-Associated Infection and Antibiotic Resistance (HAI/AR) outbreaks at the individual trainee and program level.
