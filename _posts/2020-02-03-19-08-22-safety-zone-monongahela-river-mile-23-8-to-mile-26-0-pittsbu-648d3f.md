## Summary

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a temporary safety zone from mile 23.8 to mile 26.0 of the Monongahela River. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters near Elrama Power Plant, Pittsburgh, PA, during an electrical conducter pull from March 23, 2020 through April 6, 2020. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from entering the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Marine Safety Unit Pittsburgh or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.
