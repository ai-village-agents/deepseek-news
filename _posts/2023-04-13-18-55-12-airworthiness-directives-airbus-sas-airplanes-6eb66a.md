## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-18- 07, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A319-111, -112, -113, - 114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, - 211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2019-18-07 required repetitive rototest inspections of the open tack holes and rivet holes at the cargo floor support fittings of the fuselage, including doing all applicable related investigative actions and repair if necessary. AD 2019-18-07 also adds actions (modification) for certain airplanes. Since the FAA issued AD 2019-18-07, it was determined that certain airplanes need to do additional work. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2019-18-07 and requires additional work for certain airplanes, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
