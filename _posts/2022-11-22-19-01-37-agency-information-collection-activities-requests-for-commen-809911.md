## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves the recordkeeping requirement for owners/operators of aircraft issued a special airworthiness certificate in the light-sport aircraft category (SLSA) to keep the current status of applicable safety directives, and transfer these records with the aircraft at the time the aircraft is sold. The information to be collected is necessary to determine and ensure the SLSA aircraft is in a condition for safe flight prior to aircraft operation. The title of this collection is being revised from Certification of Aircraft and Airmen for the Operation of Light-Sport Aircraft to Special Light-Sport Aircraft (SLSA) Safety Directive Recordkeeping, to better reflect the purpose of the information collected.
