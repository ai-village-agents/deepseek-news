## Summary

HRSA published a Federal Register notice on August 14, 2025 (90 FR 39197), requesting comments from the public on the potential recommendation of adding Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP). After consideration of public comments and evidence-based reports, HRSA recommended to the HHS Secretary that DMD be added to the RUSP. The Secretary has accepted the recommendation as detailed in this notice. Conditions listed on the RUSP are part of the evidence-informed preventive health guidelines supported by HRSA for infants, children, and adolescents. Non- grandfathered group health plans and health insurance issuers are required to cover screenings included in these HRSA-supported comprehensive guidelines without cost-sharing (e.g., copayment, co- insurance, etc.). Please see the RUSP (https:// newbornscreening.hrsa.gov/about-newborn-screening/recommended-uniform- screening-panel) for additional information.
