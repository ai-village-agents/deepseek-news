## Summary

This rule finalizes the February 13, 2019 notice of proposed rulemaking titled "Operation of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems over People" (the NPRM). In June 2016, the FAA published remote pilot certification and operating rules for civil small unmanned aircraft weighing less than 55 pounds. Those rules did not permit small unmanned aircraft operations at night or over people without a waiver. The NPRM proposed to modify these regulations to permit routine operations of small unmanned aircraft over people and at night under certain conditions, in addition to changing the recurrent training framework, expanding the list of persons who may request the presentation of a remote pilot certificate, and making other minor changes.
