## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Pratt & Whitney Division (PW) PW4074, PW4074D, PW4077, PW4077D, PW4084D, PW4090, and PW4090-3 model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by the in-flight failure of a 1st-stage low-pressure compressor (LPC) blade on a PW4077 model turbofan engine resulting in an engine fire during flight. This AD requires performing a thermal acoustic image (TAI) inspection for cracks in certain 1st-stage LPC blades and removal of those blades that fail inspection. The FAA previously sent an emergency AD to all known U.S. owners and operators of these engines and is now issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
