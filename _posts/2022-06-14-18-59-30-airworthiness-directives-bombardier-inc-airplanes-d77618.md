## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-700-1A10 and BD-700-1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of oxygen leaks caused by cracked, brittle, or broken oxygen hoses that were found during scheduled maintenance tests of the airplane oxygen system. This AD requires an inspection of the oxygen hose assembly to determine if an affected part number is installed, and replacement of affected oxygen hoses. For certain airplanes, this AD allows repetitive testing of the oxygen system until affected hoses are replaced. This AD also prohibits installation of an affected oxygen hose. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
