## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Garmin International (Garmin) GMN-00962 GTS processor units (GTS 825, GTS 855, GTS 8000). This AD was prompted by reports of GTS processor units issuing resolution advisories (RAs) when no risk of collision or loss of separation exists between the airplanes involved. This AD requires updating the software version of the affected GTS Processor units. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
