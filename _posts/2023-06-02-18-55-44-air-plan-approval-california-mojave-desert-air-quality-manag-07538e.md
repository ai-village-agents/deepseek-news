## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a revision to the Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District (MDAQMD or "District") portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). This revision concerns emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) from Portland cement kilns. We are approving a local rule that regulates these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act). Approving this rule corrects a deficiency identified in MDAQMD's reasonably available control technology (RACT) demonstrations for the 1997 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and the 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS.
