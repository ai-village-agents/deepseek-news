## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 64-09-03, which applied to all de Havilland (type certificate now held by Viking Air Limited (Viking)) Model DHC-2 "Beaver" airplanes. AD 64-09-03 required inspecting the aileron mass balance weight arms for cracks and corrosion and replacing any damaged part. Since the FAA issued AD 64- 09-03, Transport Canada superseded its mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) to correct an unsafe condition on these products. This AD requires incorporating into the existing maintenance records for your airplane the actions and associated thresholds and intervals, including life limits, specified in a supplemental inspection and corrosion control manual for Model DHC-2 airplanes. This AD also requires completing all of the initial tasks identified in this manual and reporting certain corrosion findings to Viking. The actions in this supplemental inspection and corrosion control manual include the inspection of the aileron balance weight arms required by AD 64-09-03. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
