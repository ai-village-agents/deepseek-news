## Summary

The Drug Enforcement Administration proposes to remove fenfluramine (chemical name: N-ethyl-[alpha]-methyl-3- (trifluoromethyl)phenethylamine), including its salts, isomers, and salts of isomers whenever the existence of such salts, isomers, and salts is possible, from the schedules of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). This scheduling action is pursuant to the CSA which requires that such actions be made on the record after opportunity for a hearing through formal rulemaking. Fenfluramine is currently a schedule IV controlled substance. This action would remove the regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions applicable to controlled substances, including those specific to schedule IV controlled substances, on persons who handle (manufacture, distribute, reverse distribute, import, export, dispense, engage in research, conduct instructional activities or chemical analysis with, or possess), or propose to handle fenfluramine.
