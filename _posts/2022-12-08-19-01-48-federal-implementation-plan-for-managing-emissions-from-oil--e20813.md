## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is promulgating a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) under the Clean Air Act (CAA) and the EPA's implementing regulations that consists of emissions control requirements for existing, new, and modified oil and natural gas sources on Indian country lands within the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation (also referred to as the U&O Reservation) to address air quality in and around the Uinta Basin Ozone Nonattainment Area in northeast Utah. This U&O FIP establishes volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions control requirements for oil and natural gas production and processing on Indian country lands within the U&O Reservation. These requirements are consistent with those in place in areas within the Basin where the EPA has approved Utah to implement the CAA, and will help ensure that new development of oil and natural gas sources in the Basin will not interfere with attainment of the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). VOC emissions control requirements for existing oil and natural gas sources have already been established in areas within the Basin where the EPA has approved Utah to implement the CAA, but did not exist for most sources on Indian country lands within the U&O Reservation. Additionally, this U&O FIP helps demonstrate that new development on Indian country lands within the U&O Reservation will not necessarily cause or contribute to an ozone NAAQS violation.
