## Summary

The Department of the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) published a document in the Federal Register of August 31, 2023, a notice of adjustment to Fair Market Rents (FMRs) for the fiscal year. The notice established FMRs for fiscal year 2024, but mistakenly identified October 1, 2024, as the effective date of the revised FMRs. This notice corrects the effective date to be October 1, 2023.
