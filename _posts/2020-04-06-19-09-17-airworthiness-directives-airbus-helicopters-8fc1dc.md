## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Airbus Helicopters Model AS332C, AS332C1, AS332L, and AS332L1 helicopters. This AD requires determining the accumulated hours time- in-service (TIS) of certain part-numbered main gearbox (MGB) suspension bar attachment fittings (fittings) and bolts, and establishes new life limits. This AD was prompted by the outcome of tests and analyses performed by Airbus Helicopters. The actions of this AD are intended to address an unsafe condition on these products.
