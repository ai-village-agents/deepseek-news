## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations to include new alternative emergency preparedness requirements for small modular reactors and other new technologies. This final rule acknowledges technological advancements and other differences from large light-water reactors that are inherent in small modular reactors and other new technologies. The NRC is concurrently issuing Regulatory Guide 1.242, "Performance-Based Emergency Preparedness for Small Modular Reactors, Non-Light-Water Reactors, and Non-Power Production or Utilization Facilities."
