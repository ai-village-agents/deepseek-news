## Summary

Pursuant to authority delegated by the President on July 8, 2022, the U.S. Trade Representative reached an agreement with Canada limiting the export from Canada and the import into the United States of certain crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells (whether or not partially or fully assembled into other products) (CSPV products). The U.S. Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretaries of Commerce and Energy, has determined that the agreement will ensure that imports of CSPV products originating in Canada do not undermine the effectiveness of the President's safeguard action proclaimed on imports of CSPV products. The U.S. Trade Representative is modifying the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) to suspend application of the safeguard measure to imports of CSPV products originating in Canada.
