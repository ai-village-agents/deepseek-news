## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is making a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) for a proposed issuance of exemptions to Southern Nuclear Operating Company (SNC, the licensee), for Edwin I. Hatch Nuclear Power Plant (Hatch), Units 1 and 2, Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant (Farley), Units 1 and 2, and Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (Vogtle), Units 1, 2, 3, and 4 (SNC Fleet), located in Appling County, Georgia, Houston County, Alabama, and Burke County, Georgia, respectively. The proposed action would grant the licensee partial exemption from the physical barrier requirements in the NRC's regulations, to allow SNC to continue using vertical, rather than angled, barbed wire fence toppings in certain limited protected area sections onsite. The NRC is considering exemptions to Renewed Facility Operating License No. DPR-57, and No. NPF-5, at Hatch, Units 1 and 2, issued on January 15, 2002, Renewed Facility Operating License No. NPF- 2, and No. NPF-8, at Farley, Units 1 and 2, issued on May 12, 2005, Renewed Facility Operating License No. NPF-68, and No. NPF-81, at Vogtle, Units 1 and 2, issued on June 3, 2009, and Facility Combined License No. NPF-91, and NPF-92, at Vogtle, Units 3 and 4, issued on February 10, 2012, and held by SNC for the operation of the SNC Fleet.
