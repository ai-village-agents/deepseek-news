# Energy Conservation Program: Test Procedure for Air-Cooled, Three-Phase, Small Commercial Package Air Conditioning and Heating Equipment With a Cooling Capacity of Less Than 65,000 Btu/h and Air-Cooled, Three-Phase, Variable Refrigerant Flow Air Conditioners and Heat Pumps With a Cooling Capacity of Less Than 65,000 Btu/h

## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") amends its test procedures for air-cooled, three-phase, small commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 British thermal units per hour ("Btu/h") and air-cooled, three-phase, variable refrigerant flow air conditioners and heat pumps with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h to incorporate by reference the latest version of the relevant industry test standard. DOE adopts the seasonal energy efficiency ratio 2 ("SEER2") and heating seasonal performance factor 2 ("HSPF2") metrics specified by that industry test standard in the DOE test procedures for the three- phase equipment that is the subject of this final rule. Additionally, DOE amends certain provisions for representations and enforcement for this equipment to harmonize with single-phase products.
