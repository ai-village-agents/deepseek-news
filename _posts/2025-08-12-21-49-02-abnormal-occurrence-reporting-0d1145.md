## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing a limited revision to its policy statement on reporting abnormal occurrences (AOs) to Congress. The revised policy statement provides more specific language to the medical event criteria to better identify those incidents and events that the Commission considers significant from the standpoint of public health or safety. The revised AO criteria contain additional language to add clarity, helping to delineate abnormal occurrence events from nonreportable events which may have been reviewed under the previous criteria.
