## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to modify and reissue a current DHS system of records titled, "DHS/U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)-009 Electronic System for Travel Authorization System of Records." The Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) system is a web-based system used to determine the eligibility of international travelers to travel to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP).\1\ DHS/CBP is updating this system of records to (1) reflect the expansion of the categories of records to include the collection of photographs, (2) clarify the retention schedule, and (3) remove references to the I-94W, "Nonimmigrant Visa Waiver Arrival/ Departure Record". The exemptions for the existing system of records notice will continue to be applicable for this updated system of records notice. This modified system of records notice will be included in the DHS's inventory of record systems. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
