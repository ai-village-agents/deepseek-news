## Summary

Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has determined to review an initial determination ("ID") (Order No. 47) of the presiding Administrative Law Judge ("ALJ") granting summary determination of invalidity based on obviousness-type double patenting. On review, the Commission affirms with modifications the ID's finding that the asserted claims of U.S. Patent No. 8,139,878 ("the '878 patent") are invalid. The Commission takes no position as to the ID's findings with respect to the '238 patent, except to the extent those findings also support the ID's invalidity findings with respect to the '878 patent. Accordingly, the Commission terminates the investigation with a finding of no violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended ("section 337"). The investigation is terminated.
