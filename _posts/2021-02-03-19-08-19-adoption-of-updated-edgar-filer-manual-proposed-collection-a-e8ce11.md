## Summary

The Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") is adopting revisions to Volumes I and II of the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system ("EDGAR") Filer Manual ("EDGAR Filer Manual" or "Filer Manual") and related rules. The revisions substantially reduce the length of Volume I, and amend Volume I and related rules under Regulation S-T, including provisions regarding electronic notarizations and remote online notarizations, which include electronic signatures. The revisions to Volume II reflect changes made to EDGAR on December 14, 2020. The Commission is also providing notice and soliciting comments on the Form ID collection of information pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
