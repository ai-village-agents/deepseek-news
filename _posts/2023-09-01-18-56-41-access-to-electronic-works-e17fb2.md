## Summary

The U.S. Copyright Office is issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking to update its regulation governing electronic deposits of published works submitted to the Office that have been selected for addition to the collections of the Library of Congress. The current regulation permits the Library to collect and provide limited on-site access to groups of newspapers electronically submitted for registration, as well as electronic serials and books submitted for mandatory deposit. The proposed rule expands the categories of electronic deposits covered by the regulation with the same limitations on access as are currently in place. The proposed changes are part of ongoing steps by the Library and the Office to encourage the submission of works in electronic form and reduce the need for copyright owners to deposit physical copies.
