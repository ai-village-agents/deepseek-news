## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a final rule in the Federal Register on March 26, 2020, to complete the residual risk and technology review (RTR) for the Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Landfills source category as regulated under national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP). The final rule also made minor changes to the 2016 MSW Landfills New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and Emission Guidelines and Compliance Times for MSW Landfills to improve implementation of the sets of rules affecting MSW landfills. In this action, the EPA is proposing technical revisions and clarifications for the NESHAP for MSW Landfills established in the March 26, 2020, final rule. These changes correct inadvertent errors and clarify wellhead monitoring requirements for the purpose of identifying excess air infiltration; delegation of authority to state, local, or tribal agencies for "emission standards"; applicability of the General Provisions to affected MSW landfills; and handling of monitoring data for combustion devices during periods of monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and adjustments. We are proposing further amendments to the 2016 MSW Landfills NSPS to clarify and align the timing of compliance for certain requirements of the 2016 MSW Landfills NSPS for existing MSW landfills that have modified but previously triggered the requirement to install a gas collection and control system (GCCS) under related MSW landfill rules.
