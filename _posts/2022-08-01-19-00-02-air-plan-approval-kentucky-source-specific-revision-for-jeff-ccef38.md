## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the Kentucky State Implementation Plan (SIP), submitted by the Commonwealth of Kentucky, through the Kentucky Division for Air Quality (KDAQ), on March 29, 2021. The proposed revision was submitted by KDAQ on behalf of the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District (District or Jefferson County), which has jurisdiction over Jefferson County, Kentucky. The proposed revision would remove from the SIP several source-specific permits for a facility in the county that were previously incorporated by reference and replace them with a Board Order with emissions controls that are at least as stringent as those in the permits.
