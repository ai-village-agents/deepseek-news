## Summary

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is amending its regulations to codify certain law enforcement authorities delegated by the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) to the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and subsequently redelegated to particular officers or employees of USCIS. These authorities allow particular USCIS personnel to investigate and enforce civil and criminal violations of the immigration laws within the jurisdiction of USCIS. These authorities include, but are not limited to, the issuance and execution of warrants, the arrest of individuals, and carrying of firearms.
