## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that cracks were found following fatigue tests for the new lower wing cover material on airplanes equipped with sharklets. This AD requires repetitive inspections for discrepancies and corrective action. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
