The submission will describe the nature of the information collection, the categories of respondents, the estimated burden (i.e., the time, effort and resources used by respondents to respond) and cost, and the actual data collection instruments FEMA will use. This notice seeks comments concerning a collection to obtain information from recent disaster survivors while they have current memories of their experience to better provide necessary direction, coordination, and guidance for emergency preparedness for the protection of life and property in the United States from hazards.
