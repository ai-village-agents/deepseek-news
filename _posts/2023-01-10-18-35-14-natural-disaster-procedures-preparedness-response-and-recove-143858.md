## Summary

On November 15, 2022, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) published a proposed rule to revise its natural disaster procedures under this part of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), which implements a section of the Flood Control Act of 1941, as amended. The comment period was originally scheduled to end on January 17, 2023, and we received requests to extend the comment period. I am extending the comment period by 30 days to provide a 90-day comment period for this proposed rule. Comments previously submitted do not need to be resubmitted, as they have already been incorporated into the administrative record and will be fully considered in the Corps' decision-making process for this rulemaking action.
