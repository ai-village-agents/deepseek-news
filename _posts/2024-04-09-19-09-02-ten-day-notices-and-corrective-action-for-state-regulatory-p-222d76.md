## Summary

The Department of the Interior is amending its regulations related to the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement's (OSMRE's) notifications to a State regulatory authority of a possible violation of any requirement of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The final rule also amends the Federal regulations regarding corrective actions for State regulatory program issues. Together, the updates to these two areas of the Federal regulations amend the overall "ten-day notice" (TDN) process and OSMRE's oversight process.
