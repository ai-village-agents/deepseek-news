## Summary

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) invites public comments about our intention to request approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for a reinstatement of a previously approved collection of information on Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 125. Before a Federal agency can collect certain information from the public, it must receive approval from the OMB. Under procedures established by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, before seeking OMB approval, Federal agencies must solicit public comment on proposed collections of information, including extensions and reinstatements of previously approved collections. This document describes a collection of information for labeling information required by FMVSS No. 125, for which NHTSA intends to seek OMB approval. The labeling requirement is for warning devices.
