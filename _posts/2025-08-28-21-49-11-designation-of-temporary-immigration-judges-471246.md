## Summary

This final rule aligns the regulatory requirements for candidates for Temporary Immigration Judge ("TIJ") appointments to mirror the regulatory requirements for permanent Immigration Judge ("IJ") appointments, thus allowing the Attorney General and Director of EOIR to select TIJs from a larger pool of well-qualified candidates. Additionally, the Department of Justice ("the Department" or "DOJ") is making various technical and non-substantive changes to its regulations.
