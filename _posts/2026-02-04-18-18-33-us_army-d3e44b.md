The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a nationwide Health Alert Network Health Advisory on January 20 to share information about the New World screwworm, or NWS, and the recent increase in animal cases in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, which shares a border with Texas. Although no NWS infestations have been identified in people or animals in the United States, there is potential for geographic spread. The advisory issued by the CDC is intended to increase awareness of the expanding NWS outbreak and provide recommendations to health departments and doctors in the U.S. as well as guidance for the general public.
