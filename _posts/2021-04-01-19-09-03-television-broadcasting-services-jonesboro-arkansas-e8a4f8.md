## Summary

The Commission has before it a petition for rulemaking filed by Gray Television Licensee, LLC, (Gray), licensee of KAIT, channel 8, Jonesboro, Arkansas, requesting the substitution of channel 27 for channel 8 at Jonesboro in the DTV Table of Allotments. In support of its channel substitution request, Gray states that the Commission has recognized that VHF channels have certain propagation characteristics which may cause reception issues for some viewers, and also that the reception of VHF signals require larger antennas, relative to UHF channels." According to Gray, many of its viewers experience significant difficulty receiving KAIT's signal, and while there is small terrain limited predicted loss area, the viewers will continue to be well served by at least five other stations and receive ABC network service from another station licensed to Memphis, Tennessee.
