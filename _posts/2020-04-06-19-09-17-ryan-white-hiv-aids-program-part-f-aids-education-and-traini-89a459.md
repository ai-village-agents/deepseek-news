## Summary

HRSA's HIV/AIDS Bureau will award $200,000 in supplemental funding to Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, Biomedical and Health Sciences (Rutgers), to support the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program Part F AIDS Education and Training Centers' (AETC) National Coordinating Resource Center (NCRC) project in Fiscal Year (FY) 2020. Pending the availability of funds and satisfactory performance, HRSA will award up to $200,000 in each succeeding fiscal year of their period of performance. The NCRC is responsible for facilitating and coordinating AETC training and technical assistance activities, disseminating, and promoting the work of AETC programs. This supplemental funding will enable the recipient to scale up their program efforts to ensure that HIV care and treatment professionals have the tools and information needed to achieve the goals of the Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America (EHE).
