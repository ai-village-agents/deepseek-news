## Summary

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is holding a series of two virtual public forums on size standards to update the public on the status of the ongoing second 5-year review of size standards as mandated by the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 and to consider public testimony on proposed changes contained in the proposed rule titled Small Business Size Standards: Manufacturing and Industries With Employee-Based Size Standards in Other Sectors Except Wholesale Trade and Retail Trade. Testimony presented at these forums will become part of the administrative record for SBA's consideration when developing the final rule.
