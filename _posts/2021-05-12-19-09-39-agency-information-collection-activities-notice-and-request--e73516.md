## Summary

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration invites public comments about our intention to request approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to reinstate a previously-approved information collection with modification. Before a Federal agency can collect certain information from the public, it must receive approval from OMB. Under procedures established by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, before seeking OMB approval, Federal agencies must solicit public comment on proposed collections of information, including extensions and reinstatements of previously approved collections. This document describes a collection of information for which NHTSA intends to seek OMB approval on Vehicle Owner's Manual Requirements for Motor Vehicles and Motor Vehicle Equipment.
