# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus SAS Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A350-941 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report indicating that the inflatable free aisle restrictor (IFAR) on certain single lane slide-rafts demonstrated inconsistent release behavior in aft wind conditions. This proposed AD would require replacing an affected part with a serviceable part, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
