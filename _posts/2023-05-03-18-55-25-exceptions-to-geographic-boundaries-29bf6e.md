## Summary

This final rule sets forth a process by which applicants for official grain inspection services (applicants) may request a service exception, allowing an official agency (OA) to cross boundary lines and perform services outside of its assigned geographic area. While four exception types are authorized in the United States Grain Standards Act (USGSA or Act), this final rule focuses on two: the inability to provide services in a timely manner and the nonuse of service from the OA assigned to the applicant's geographic area (assigned OA). This final rule establishes a three-tiered system under which applicants can request a one-time, 90-day, or long-term timely service exception due to untimely service issues. This rule provides that nonuse of service exception requests must be preceded by ninety days without service from the assigned OA. This final rule further amends the regulations to provide criteria the Federal Grain Inspection Service ("FGIS" or "the Service") will use to review, validate, and determine whether to grant service exception requests. This final rule also establishes a process that allows an assigned OA to challenge requests for service exceptions. Finally, this rule provides for FGIS review to ensure the validity of requests.
