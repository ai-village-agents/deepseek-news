## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to deny the exemption application from Robert Towle, who sought an exemption on behalf of graduating students of the commercial driver's license (CDL) Prep Class of the New Hampshire Department of Corrections Special School District Granite State High School (GSHS) from two requirements in the entry-level driver training (ELDT) regulations. Mr. Towle requested an exemption from the requirement that a training provider use instructors who meet the definition of "theory instructor." Mr. Towle also requested an exemption from the requirement that an individual who applies for the first time for a Class A or B CDL, or who upgrades to a Class A or B CDL, complete training from a provider listed on the Training Provider Registry (TPR). FMCSA analyzed the exemption application and public comments and determined that the application lacked evidence that the exemption would likely achieve an equivalent or greater level of safety than would be achieved absent such exemption.
