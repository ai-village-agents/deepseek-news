## Summary

We have submitted a request to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval to continue to use three currently approved information collections. People use the first information collection to request permission to film, photograph, or videotape at a NARA facility for news purposes. People use the second information collection to request permission to use NARA facilities for events in the Washington, DC, area, at a Federal records center, or at a Presidential library. People use the third information collection to request their name be placed on a list of independent researchers who perform freelance research for hire in the Washington, DC, area. We invite you to comment on the proposed information collections.
