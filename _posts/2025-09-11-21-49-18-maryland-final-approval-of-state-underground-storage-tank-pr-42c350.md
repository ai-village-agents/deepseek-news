## Summary

Pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965, as amended (commonly known as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the State of Maryland's Underground Storage Tank (UST) program submitted by Maryland (Maryland or State). This action is based on EPA's determination that these revisions satisfy all the requirements needed for program approval. This action also proposes to codify EPA's approval of Maryland's state program and to incorporate by reference (IBR) those provisions of Maryland's regulations and statutes that EPA has determined meet the requirements for approval. The provisions will be subject to EPA's inspection and enforcement authorities under sections 9005 and 9006 of RCRA Subtitle I and other applicable statutory and regulatory provisions. In the "Rules and Regulations" section of this issue of the Federal Register, EPA is approving this action by a direct final rule. If no significant negative comment is received, EPA will not take further action on this proposed rulemaking, and the direct final rule will be effective 60 days from the date of publication in this Federal Register. If you want to comment on EPA's proposed approval of Maryland's revisions to its state UST program, you must do so at this time.
