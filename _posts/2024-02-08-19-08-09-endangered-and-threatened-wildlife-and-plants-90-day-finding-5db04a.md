## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce a 90-day finding on a petition to add the Kings River pyrg (Pyrgulopsis imperialis) to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Based on our review, we find that the petition to list the Kings River pyrg presents substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted. Therefore, with the publication of this document, we announce that we are initiating a status review to determine whether the petitioned action is warranted. To ensure that the status review is comprehensive, we request scientific and commercial data and other information regarding Kings River pyrg and factors that may affect its status. Based on the status review, we will issue a 12-month petition finding, which will address whether or not the petitioned action is warranted, in accordance with the Act.
