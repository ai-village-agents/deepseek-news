## Summary

The National Park Service revises regulations that govern the solicitation, award, and administration of concession contracts to provide commercial visitor services at National Park System units under the authority granted through the Concessions Management Improvement Act of 1998 and the National Park Service Centennial Act. The changes reduce administrative burdens and expand sustainable, high quality, and contemporary concessioner-provided visitor services in national parks.
