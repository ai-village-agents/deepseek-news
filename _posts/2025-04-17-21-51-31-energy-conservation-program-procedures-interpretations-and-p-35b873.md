## Summary

As part of its implementation of the Executive order, "Unleashing American Energy" (Jan. 20, 2025), the Department of Energy (DOE or the Department) is seeking comments and information from interested parties to assist DOE in identifying potential modifications to its procedures, interpretations, and policies for considering new or revised energy conservation standards and test procedures for consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment (i.e., the "Process Rule"). DOE is initiating this effort through this request for information to ensure consistency with recently issued Executive Orders, while continuing to satisfy the Department's statutory obligations in the development of appliance and equipment standards under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA). Subsequently, DOE expects to expeditiously publish a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) that proposes potential changes to the Process Rule and that will also provide feedback on the public comment received in response to this document and seek additional information on other potential improvements.
