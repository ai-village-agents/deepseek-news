## Summary

On October 16, 2020, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) issued a final rule revising provisions of the AID Acquisition Regulation (AIDAR) that pertain to the General Provision contract clause 5, entitled "Leave and Holidays" for U.S. personal services contractors (USPSCs.) This document corrects typographical errors in the final rule by revising the text of clause 5, adding the effective dates in the titles of clauses 6 and 16, and revising the authority citation.
