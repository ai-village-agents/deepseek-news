## Summary

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) invites public comment on one currently approved Information Collection Request (ICR), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number 1652-0046, abstracted below, that we will submit to OMB for an extension in compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected burden. The information collection involves passenger information that certain U.S. aircraft operators and foreign air carriers ("covered aircraft operators") submit to Secure Flight for purposes of identifying and protecting against potential threats to transportation and national security, and determining prescreening status of individuals.
