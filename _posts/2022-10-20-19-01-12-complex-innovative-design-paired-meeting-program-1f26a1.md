## Summary

The seventh iteration of the Prescription Drug User Amendments (PDUFA VII), included as part of the FDA User Fee Reauthorization Act of 2022, highlights the goal of facilitating and advancing the use of complex adaptive, Bayesian, and other novel clinical trial designs. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the continuation of the paired meeting program established under the sixth iteration of PDUFA that affords sponsors, who are selected, the opportunity to meet with Agency staff to discuss the use of complex innovative trial design (CID) approaches in medical product development. Meetings under the program will be conducted by FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) or Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) during fiscal years 2023 to 2027. For each sponsor whose meeting request is granted, two meetings will be held between the sponsor and CDER or CBER that will provide an opportunity for medical product developers to discuss their CID proposals. To promote innovation in this area, trial designs developed through the paired meeting program may be presented by FDA (e.g., in a guidance or public workshop) as case studies, including trial designs for drugs that have not yet been approved by FDA.
