## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to correct the erroneous incorporation of several rules and related definitions into the Florida State Implementation Plan (SIP). The rules being proposed for removal from the SIP, which are identified by Florida in letters to EPA dated March 16, 2021, and July 2, 2021, regulate odor, fluoride, and total reduced sulfur (TRS) emissions. EPA is proposing to remove these rules and definitions from the Florida SIP because they are not related to implementation, maintenance, or enforcement of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) or otherwise required to be included in the SIP.
