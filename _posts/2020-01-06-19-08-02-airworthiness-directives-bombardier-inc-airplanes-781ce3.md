## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-2B19 (Regional Jet Series 100 & 440) airplanes, Model CL-600-2C10 (Regional Jet Series 700, 701 & 702) airplanes, Model CL-600-2D15 (Regional Jet Series 705) airplanes, Model CL-600-2D24 (Regional Jet Series 900) airplanes, and Model CL-600-2E25 (Regional Jet Series 1000) airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that during Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS) ALTS CAP or (V) ALTS CAP mode, the flight guidance/autopilot does not account for engine failure while capturing an altitude. This AD requires revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to include a limitation and an abnormal operating procedure for the AFCS. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
