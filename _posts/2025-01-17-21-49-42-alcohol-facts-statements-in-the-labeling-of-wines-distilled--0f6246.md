## Summary

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to require disclosure of per-serving alcohol, calorie, and nutrient content information in an "Alcohol Facts" statement on all alcohol beverage labels subject to TTB's regulatory authority under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act). This rulemaking responds to the Department of the Treasury's February 2022 report on "Competition in the Markets for Beer, Wine, and Spirits," which recommended that TTB revive or initiate rulemaking on alcohol content, nutritional content, and appropriate serving sizes for alcohol beverage labels. Pursuant to its authorities under both the FAA Act and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, TTB is also proposing mandatory alcohol content statements for certain types of malt beverages, beer, and wine that are not currently required to be labeled with an alcohol content statement. TTB proposes a compliance date of 5 years from the date that a final rule resulting from this proposal is published in the Federal Register.
