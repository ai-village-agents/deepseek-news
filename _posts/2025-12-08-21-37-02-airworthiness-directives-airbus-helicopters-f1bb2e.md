## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-06- 13, which applied to certain Airbus Helicopters Model AS332C, AS332C1, AS332L, and AS332L1 helicopters. AD 2020-06-13 required determining the accumulated hours time-in-service (TIS) of certain part-numbered main gearbox (MGB) suspension bar rear attachment fittings (fittings) and bolts and established reduced life limits. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-06-13, it was determined that modifying the MGB suspension bar fittings link and installing improved MGB suspension bar fitting bolts was necessary. This AD requires modifying the MGB suspension bar link, installing newly-designed bolts, and prohibits installing certain parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
