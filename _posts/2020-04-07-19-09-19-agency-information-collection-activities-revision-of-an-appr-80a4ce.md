FMCSA requests approval to revise an ICR titled "Training Certification for Entry-Level Commercial Motor Vehicle Operators," which will now be used to register providers of entry-level driver training and to provide State Drivers' Licensing Agencies with information on individuals who have completed said training. If approved, this revision will allow FMCSA to collect information on registered training providers and entry-level driver training certification information until 2022.
