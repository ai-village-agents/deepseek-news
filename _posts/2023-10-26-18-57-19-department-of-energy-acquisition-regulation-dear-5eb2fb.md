## Summary

The Department of Energy (DOE) proposes a comprehensive revision of its Acquisition Regulation in order to update and streamline the policies, procedures, provisions and clauses that are applicable to its contracts. This rulemaking proposes to update or eliminate coverage that is obsolete or that unnecessarily duplicates the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and retain only that coverage which either implements or supplements the FAR for the award and administration of the DOE's contracts. The rule proposes the addition of several new clauses as well as amendments to several existing clauses, which will promote more uniform application of the DOE's contract award and administration policies.
