## Summary

FMCSA announces that it has received an application from Pitt Ohio Express, LLC (Pitt Ohio) to exempt its drivers from one of the requirements in the Agency's Safe Driver Apprenticeship Pilot (SDAP) program. Pitt Ohio is requesting to use drivers under the age 21 that have a Commercial Learner's Permit (CLP) to operate commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) in interstate commerce to participate in the SDAP program. If granted, Pitt Ohio believes it would have less difficulty recruiting drivers to participate in the program. FMCSA requests public comment on the applicant's request for exemption.
