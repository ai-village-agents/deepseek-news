## Summary

In this document, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (WTB) and Office of Economics and Analytics (OEA) seek comment on the process to continue the filing of mobile deployment data consistent with previous FCC Form 477 filings for mobile participants of the Alaska Plan. The document also provides information from the Wireline Competition Bureau (WCB) for mobile recipients of the Uniendo a Puerto Rico Fund and Connect USVI Fund to file their FCC Form 477 network coverage data as part of their final milestone requirement. In addition, WCB waives the data reporting requirement for the interim milestone for mobile recipients of the Uniendo a Puerto Rico Fund and the Connect USVI Fund.
