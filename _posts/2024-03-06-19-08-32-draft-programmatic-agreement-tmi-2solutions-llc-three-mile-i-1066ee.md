## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is requesting comment on a draft Programmatic Agreement (PA) between the NRC, Pennsylvania State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), and TMI-2 Energy Solutions (TMI-2Solutions). The purpose of this draft PA is to resolve any adverse effects to historic properties identified during consultation for a license amendment request for the Three Mile Island Nuclear Station, Unit No. 2 (TMI-2), located in Londonderry Township, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. TMI-2Solutions will be engaging in certain major decommissioning activities, including the physical demolition of buildings previously deemed eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Because the impacts on the historic properties from these decommissioning activities have not been previously evaluated and are not bounded by NUREG-0586, "Final Generic Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS) on Decommissioning of Nuclear Facilities", the NRC initiated consultation under the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). During the NHPA section 106 consultation, it was determined that there would be adverse effects to historic properties and a PA was developed to address resolution of adverse effects.
