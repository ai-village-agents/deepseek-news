This information collection request will be submitted for approval to the Office of Management Budget (OMB) in compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA).

To carry out this policy, FMCS have issued regulations which provide for the operation and maintenance of a roster of professional arbitrators. The arbitrators are private citizens, not employees of FMCS, and are paid by the parties for hearing and deciding the issues submitted under a collective bargaining agreement and in other circumstances. The Request for Arbitration Panel, FMCS Form R-43, is used by the parties, labor and management individually or jointly, to request that FMCS furnish a list of arbitrators.
