## Summary

The Coast Guard is removing 81 special drawbridge operating regulations that previously operated over various waterways throughout the United States. In some cases, these 81 drawbridge regulations have either been replaced with a fixed bridge, removed from the waterway, or altered in such a manner that the drawspan is no longer moveable. Alternatively, the rail lines or roadways are no longer in service, leaving the drawspan inoperable, abandoned, and open to navigation. The drawbridges are, in some form, no longer operational and the regulations are no longer applicable or necessary.
