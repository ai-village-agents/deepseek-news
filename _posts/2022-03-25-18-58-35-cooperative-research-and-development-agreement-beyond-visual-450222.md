## Summary

The Coast Guard announces its intent to enter into a cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) with companies to evaluate a detect and avoid (DAA) system to determine its potential use in a maritime environment to enable the Coast Guard to safely fly small UAS (SUAS) beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS). The Coast Guard will conduct flight testing and evaluations of SUAS DAA technology against CG mission scenarios. From our previous solicitations, the Coast Guard is currently considering partnering with AeroVironment (AV) Inc. and solicits public comment on the possible participation of other parties in the proposed CRADA, and the nature of that participation. The Coast Guard also invites other potential non-Federal participants, who have the interest and capability to bring similar contributions to this type of research, to consider submitting proposals for consideration in similar CRADAs.
