## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model MD-11 and MD-11F airplanes equipped with General Electric (GE) CF6-80C2D1F high-bypass turbofan engines. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a Model MD-11F airplane experiencing an uncommanded deployment of a thrust reverser in-flight at low altitude. This proposed AD would require a one-time detailed inspection of the engine pylon thrust reverser control system wire harnesses and applicable on-condition actions. The proposed AD would also require repetitive detailed inspections and wire integrity tests of the engine thrust reverser control system wire harnesses (in the pylon), junction box and junction box cover, left side and right side thrust reverser electrical harnesses, core (engine compartment) miscellaneous wire harness assembly, and 30 degree bulkhead wire harness assembly; and applicable on-condition actions. This AD also requires reporting. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
