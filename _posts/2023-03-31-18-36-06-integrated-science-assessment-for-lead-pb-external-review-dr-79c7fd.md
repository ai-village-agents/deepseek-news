## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing a 60- day public comment period for the draft document titled, "Integrated Science Assessment for Lead (External Review Draft)". This draft document was prepared by the Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment (CPHEA) within EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) as part of the review of the primary (health-based) and secondary (welfare-based) Lead (Pb) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). It represents an update of the 2013 Integrated Science Assessment (ISA) for Lead (Pb) (EPA/600/R-10/075F). The ISA, in conjunction with additional technical and policy assessments, provides the scientific foundation for EPA's decisions on the adequacy of the current NAAQS and the appropriateness of possible alternative standards. EPA is releasing the draft ISA for Pb to seek review by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) and input from the public. The date and location of a public meeting for the CASAC to discuss its review of this document will be specified in a separate Federal Register notice (FRN). The draft ISA is not final and does not represent, and should not be construed to represent, any final Agency policy or views. When revising the document, EPA will consider any public comments submitted during the public comment period specified in this notice.
