## Summary

GSA proposes to modify a system of records subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. Login.gov is a secure sign-in service with the capability to authenticate and identity proof users before the user is granted access to participating government websites or applications. GSA is modifying the categories of records in the system, the policies and practices for retrieval and routine uses of records, and removing outdated references to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) technical standards. This modification is intended to revise and replace all notices previously describing this system of records.
