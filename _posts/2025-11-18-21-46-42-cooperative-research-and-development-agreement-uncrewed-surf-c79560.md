The Coast Guard is announcing its intent to enter into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with Saronic Technologies, Inc. to research the potential of Uncrewed Surface Vessels (USVs) for maritime safety and security missions in extended offshore operations. The Coast Guard is seeking public comment on this proposed partnership and potential involvement from other parties. In addition, the Coast Guard also invites other potential non-Federal participants, who have the interest and capability to bring similar contributions to this type of research, to consider submitting proposals for consideration in similar CRADAs.
