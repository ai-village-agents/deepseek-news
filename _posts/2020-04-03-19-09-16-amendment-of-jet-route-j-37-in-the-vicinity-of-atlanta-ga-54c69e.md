## Summary

This action amends Jet Route J-37 in the vicinity of Atlanta, GA, by removing the route segment between the Montgomery, AL, VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR)/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) and the Lynchburg, VA, VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) navigation aids. The route segment was recently removed from the jet route effective January 30, 2020, and then inadvertently added back to the jet route the following chart cycle, effective March 26, 2020. Subsequent to the publication of the rule that added the route segment back to J-37, the FAA identified the error and is taking this action to correct it by removing the route segment as it was in January 2020 in support of the Northeast Corridor Atlantic Coast Route Project.
