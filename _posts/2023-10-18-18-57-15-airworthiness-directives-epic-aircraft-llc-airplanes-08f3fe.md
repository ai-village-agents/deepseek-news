## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Epic Aircraft, LLC Model E1000 airplanes. This AD was prompted by improperly rigged flap position switches. This AD requires installing a secondary full position limit switch to the flap system, installing a switch ramp on the flap actuator, and modifying the take- off position switch rigging. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
