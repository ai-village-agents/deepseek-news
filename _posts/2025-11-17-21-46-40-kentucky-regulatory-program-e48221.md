## Summary

We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), announce receipt of a proposed amendment to the Kentucky regulatory program (Kentucky program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). Through this program amendment, Kentucky seeks to amend its law to add a statutory definition for "long-term treatment" and to specify how the additional bonds for long-term treatment are to be calculated.
