## Summary

Under the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a request from the State of California to reclassify the San Diego County ozone nonattainment area from "Serious" to "Severe" for the 2008 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and from "Moderate" to "Severe" for the 2015 ozone NAAQS. Following consultation with tribes, the EPA is also proposing to reclassify in the same manner as state land, reservation areas of Indian country and any other area of Indian country within it where the EPA or a tribe has demonstrated that the tribe has jurisdiction located within the boundaries of the San Diego County ozone nonattainment area. Upon final reclassification of the San Diego County ozone nonattainment area as a Severe area for the 2008 and 2015 ozone NAAQS, the applicable attainment dates would be as expeditious as practicable but no later than July 20, 2027, for the 2008 ozone NAAQS, and August 3, 2033, for the 2015 ozone NAAQS. With respect to Severe state implementation plan (SIP) element submittal dates that have passed, the EPA is proposing to establish a deadline of no later than 12 months from the effective date of reclassification for submittal of revisions to the San Diego County portion of the California SIP to meet additional requirements for Severe ozone nonattainment areas to the extent that such revisions have not already been submitted.
