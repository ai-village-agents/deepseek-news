## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-24-10, which applies to certain The Boeing Company Model 757-200, -200PF, and -300 series airplanes. AD 2017-24-10 requires repetitive inspections for any cracking of a certain fuselage frame inner chord; identification of the material of a certain fuselage frame inner chord for certain airplanes; and applicable corrective actions. Since the FAA issued AD 2017-24-10, the FAA has received reports of new crack findings outside of the AD 2017-24-10 inspection area, which the existing inspections will not detect. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2017-24-10, would add new airplanes and would require new inspection types in certain areas, an expanded inspection area, additional inspections, and applicable corrective actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
