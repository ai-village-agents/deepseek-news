## Summary

EPA issued a notice in the Federal Register of October 18, 2023, announcing the availability of preliminary work plans (PWPs) for the following chemicals: Aureobasidium pullulans and cyflumetofen. EPA mistakenly included cyflumetofen in the list of chemicals with available PWPs. This document corrects that error by deleting cyflumetofen from the list.
