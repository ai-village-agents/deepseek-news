## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Continental Aerospace Technologies, Inc. GTSIO-520, IO-346, IO- 470, IO-520, IO-550, LTSIO-520, O-470, TSIO-520, and TSIOL-550 series model reciprocating engines, Lycoming Engines AEIO-320, AEIO-360, AEIO- 540, AIO-320, AIO-360, GO-480, GSO-480, HIO-360, HIO-540, IGO-480, IGO- 540, IGSO-480, IGSO-540, IO-320, IO-360, IO-540, LIO-360, LTIO-540, O- 235, O-320, O-360, O-540, TIGO-541, TIO-360, TIO-540, TIO-541, TVO-435, VO-435, and VO-540 series model reciprocating engines, and Textron Lycoming/Subsidiary of Textron, Inc. IO-720 series model reciprocating engines. This AD was prompted by a report of a manufacturing quality escape of improperly lubricated roller bearings installed in certain magnetos, which may result in overheating and magneto seizure. This AD requires the replacement of affected magneto or inspection of affected magneto and, if no white grease is detected, replacement of magneto components, as applicable, and reassembly of the magneto. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
