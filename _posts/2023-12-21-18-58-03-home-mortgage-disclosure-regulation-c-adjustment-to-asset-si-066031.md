## Summary

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is amending the official commentary that interprets the requirements of the CFPB's Regulation C (Home Mortgage Disclosure) to reflect the asset-size exemption threshold for banks, savings associations, and credit unions based on the annual percentage change in the average of the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). Based on the 4.1 percent increase in the average of the CPI-W for the 12- month period ending in November 2023, the exemption threshold is adjusted to $56 million from $54 million. Therefore, banks, savings associations, and credit unions with assets of $56 million or less as of December 31, 2023, are exempt from collecting data in 2024.
