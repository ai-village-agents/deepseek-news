## Summary

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) (collectively referred to as the Services or we) are proposing to rescind the regulatory definition of "harm" in our Endangered Species Act (ESA or the Act) regulations. The existing regulatory definition of "harm," which includes habitat modification, runs contrary to the best meaning of the statutory term "take." We are undertaking this change to adhere to the single, best meaning of the ESA.
