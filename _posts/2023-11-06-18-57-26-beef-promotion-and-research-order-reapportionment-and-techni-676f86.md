## Summary

This rule adjusts representation on the Cattlemen's Beef Promotion and Research Board (Board), established under the Beef Promotion and Research Act of 1985 (Act), to reflect changes in domestic cattle inventories as well as changes in levels of imported cattle, beef, and beef products that have occurred since the Board was last reapportioned in July 2020. These adjustments are required by the Beef Promotion and Research Order (Order) and will result in a decrease in Board membership from 101 to 99, effective with the Secretary of Agriculture's (Secretary) appointments from nominees requested in Spring of 2023. This final rule also updates the list of Qualified State Beef Councils (QSBCs) in the Order by removing the Maryland Beef Industry Council which voted to dissolve their State beef council.
