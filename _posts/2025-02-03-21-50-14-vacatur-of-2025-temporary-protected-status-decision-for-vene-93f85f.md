## Summary

Through this notice, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announces that the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) has decided to vacate the January 10, 2025, decision of former Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas regarding TPS for Venezuela. Former Secretary Mayorkas extended the 2023 designation of Venezuela for TPS for 18 months, allowed a consolidation of filing processes such that all eligible Venezuela TPS beneficiaries (whether under the 2021 or 2023 designations) may obtain TPS through the same extension date of October 2, 2026, and extended certain Employment Authorization Documents (EADs). All of this also had the effect of extending the 2021 designation. This notice vacates Mayorkas' notice immediately.
