## Summary

Based on a review of existing import requirements, CDC has determined that the import requirements for goatskin handicrafts from Haiti are no longer necessary to protect the public's health and should therefore be rescinded. Accordingly, effective immediately, CDC is rescinding the advisory memorandum order banning the importation of Haitian goatskin handicrafts (August 14, 1981).
