## Summary

The Bureau of the Census (Census Bureau) is giving notice of a virtual meeting of the Census Scientific Advisory Committee (CSAC). The Committee will address ongoing outreach efforts needed to assist with the designing of a differential privacy suite for the 2020 Census data products that will meet programmatic, legal, and statistical requirements, including work on both the primary and secondary disclosure avoidance systems. Last-minute changes to the schedule are possible, which could prevent giving advance public notice of schedule adjustments. Please visit the Census Advisory Committees website at http://www.census.gov/cac for the CSAC meeting information, including the agenda, and how to join the meeting.
