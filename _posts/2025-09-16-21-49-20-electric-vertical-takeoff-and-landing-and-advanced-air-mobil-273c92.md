## Summary

The Department of Transportation (DOT), through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), announces a new eVTOL and AAM Integration Pilot Program (eIPP) that will accelerate the deployment of safe and lawful eVTOL and other AAM aircraft operations in the United States. The eIPP requests that State, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) governments, in partnership with a private sector partner(s) with demonstrated experience in eVTOL or other AAM development, manufacturing, and operations, or new supporting technologies enabling AAM operations integration into the NAS, submit proposals. The eIPP continues the DOT's efforts to integrate eVTOL and other AAM aircraft developed or offered by a United States-based entity into the National Airspace System (NAS) by identifying the most effective partnerships to test and validate operational concepts that can be scaled to national and international applications. SLTT governments and their private sector partner(s) will propose and define these operational concepts under the safety oversight role of the FAA.
