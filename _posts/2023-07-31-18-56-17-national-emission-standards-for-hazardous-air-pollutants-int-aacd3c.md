## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing amendments to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Integrated Iron and Steel Manufacturing Facilities, as required by the Clean Air Act (CAA). To complete the required CAA section 112(d)(6) technology review promulgated on July 13, 2020, the EPA is proposing standards to regulate HAP emissions from five unmeasured fugitive and intermittent particulate (UFIP) sources, some of which are also referred to as "fugitive" sources, that are currently not regulated by the NESHAP, as follows: Bell Leaks, Unplanned Bleeder Valve Openings, Planned Bleeder Valve Openings, Slag Pits, and Beaching. Also, for sinter plants we are proposing standards for the following five currently unregulated HAP: carbonyl sulfide (COS), carbon disulfide (CS<INF>2</INF>), mercury (Hg), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and hydrogen fluoride (HF); for blast furnace (BF) stoves and basic oxygen process furnaces (BOPFs), we are proposing standards for the following three unregulated pollutants: total hydrocarbons (THC), HCl, and dioxins/furans (D/F); and for BFs, we are proposing standards for the following two unregulated pollutants: THC and HCl. As an update to the technology review, we are proposing to revise the current BOPF shop fugitive 20 percent opacity limit to a 5 percent opacity limit and require specific work practices; revise the current BF casthouse fugitive 20 percent opacity limit to a 5 percent opacity limit; and revise the current standards for D/F and polycyclic hydrocarbon (PAH) for sinter plants. We are also proposing a fenceline monitoring requirement for chromium (Cr), including a requirement that if a monitor exceeds the proposed Cr action level, the facility will need to conduct a root cause analysis and take corrective action to lower emissions. We solicit comments on all aspects of this proposed action.
