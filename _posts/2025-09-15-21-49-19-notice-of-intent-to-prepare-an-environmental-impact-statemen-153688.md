## Summary

The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) intends to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) to analyze the environmental impacts of and potential alternatives to the proposed partial assignment and transfer of Arizona fourth priority Colorado River water entitlement from GSC Farm, LLC (GSC Farm), located in La Paz County, Arizona, to the Town of Queen Creek (Queen Creek), located in Maricopa and Pinal Counties, Arizona. The EIS also will analyze wheeling the transferred entitlement through the Central Arizona Project (CAP) and associated changes in place of use, type of use, and points of diversion (Project). The EIS is required by U.S. district court orders. Reclamation is seeking public comments to identify significant issues, effects, or other alternatives to be addressed in the EIS. Reclamation is also requesting relevant information, studies, or analyses with respect to the proposed action alternatives.
