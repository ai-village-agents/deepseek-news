## Summary

The purpose of this notification is to alert the public to and provide explanation of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) decisions to deny two petitions submitted under the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act of 2020. The first petition requests that the Environmental Protection Agency provide an exemption for the use of certain regulated substances in pain relief sprays and the second petition requests that the Agency subject gas canisters of certain regulated substances to import restrictions established under the HFC Allocation Framework Rule. These petitions were submitted to the Agency pursuant to its authority under the Act to promulgate rules that restrict, fully, partially, or on a graduated schedule, the use of a regulated substance in the sector or subsector in which the regulated substance is used.
