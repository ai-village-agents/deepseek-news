## Summary

The FAA is withdrawing the NPRM published in the Federal Register on October 25, 2021, proposing to establish RNAV route T-384 in the vicinity of Eagle, AK, in support of a large and comprehensive T-route modernization project for the state of Alaska. Subsequent to the NPRM, the FAA determined during a flight check inspection that reliable and continuous two-way VHF communications are not possible on the proposed route and withdrawal of the NPRM is warranted.
