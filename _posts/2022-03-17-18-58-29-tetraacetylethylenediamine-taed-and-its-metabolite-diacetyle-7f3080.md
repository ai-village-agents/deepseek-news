## Summary

This regulation amends an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of tetraacetylethylenediamine (TAED) and its metabolite diacetylethylenediamine (DAED) by expanding its use in or on all food commodities, when used as a fungicide and bactericide in accordance with label directions and good agricultural practices. The Lubrizol Corporation, 29400 Lakeland Blvd., Wickliffe, OH 44092, submitted a petition, pursuant to section 408(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(d), to amend 40 CFR 180.1327. 40 CFR 180.1327 currently provides for an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of the pesticide, tetraacetylethylenediamine (TAED), and its metabolite diacetylethylenediamine (DAED), in or on rice and strawberries, when used as a fungicide and bactericide in accordance with label directions and good agricultural practices. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of tetraacetylethylenediamine (TAED) or its metabolite diacetylethylenediamine (DAED) when used in accordance with this exemption.
