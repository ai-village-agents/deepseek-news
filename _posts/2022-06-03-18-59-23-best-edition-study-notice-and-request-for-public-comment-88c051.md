## Summary

The U.S. Copyright Office is undertaking a public study at the request of Senator Thom Tillis to evaluate the deposit requirements of section 407 and 408 of the Copyright Act and consider whether "removing the `best edition' requirement from the registration deposit process in section 408 could help improve the registration process." To aid in its review of this topic, the Office is soliciting input from interested members of the public.
