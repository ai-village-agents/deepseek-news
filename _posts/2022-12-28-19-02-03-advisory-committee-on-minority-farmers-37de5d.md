## Summary

Pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), the Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement (OPPE) is announcing a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Minority Farmers (ACMF). USDA Secretary Vilsack is committed to actions that enhance minority farmers' ability to produce and thrive as businesses through USDA's customer service enhancements, expanded outreach, technical assistance, and capacity building. To that end, the ACMF will likewise recommend action-oriented strategies for maximizing the participation of minority farmers by leveraging those programs that ensure a food secure nation and effectively steward our natural resources. These principals will usher in business growth and opportunity for those minority agricultural communities plagued with fragile economies in decline.
