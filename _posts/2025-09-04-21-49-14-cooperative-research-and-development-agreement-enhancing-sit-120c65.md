## Summary

The Coast Guard is announcing its intent to enter into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with (Raymarine) to determine the efficacy of Team Awareness Kit incorporation into existing and future Coast Guard navigation systems. While the Coast Guard is currently considering partnering with (Raymarine), we are soliciting public comment on the possible nature of and participation of other parties in the proposed CRADA. The Coast Guard also encourages other federal agencies with relevant research interests and capabilities to submit proposals for similar Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs).
