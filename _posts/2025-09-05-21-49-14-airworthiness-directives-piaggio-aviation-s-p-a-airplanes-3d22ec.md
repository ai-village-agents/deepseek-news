## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Piaggio Aviation S.p.A. (Piaggio) Model P-180 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of leakage from the flexible hydraulic hoses connected to the hydraulic pump package (HPP). This proposed AD would require replacing the affected flexible hydraulic hoses. This proposed AD would also prohibit installing the affected flexible hydraulic hoses on any airplane. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
