## Summary

The FHWA, on behalf of the FDOT, is issuing this notice to announce actions taken by FDOT and other Federal Agencies that are final agency actions. These actions relate to the proposed State Road (S.R.) 85 Project Development and Environment (PD&E) Study (Financial Management Number 220171-2-22-01). The proposed S.R. 85 project will add capacity to S.R. 85 from S.R. 123 (Roger J. Clary Highway) to Mirage Avenue, a distance of approximately 12.2 miles. Improvements consist of roadway widening from four to six lanes, bridge replacements, improvements at signalized intersections, reconstruction of the interchange at I-10 as a Diverging Diamond Interchange (DDI), and the construction of stormwater management facilities. These actions grant licenses, permits, or approvals for the project.
