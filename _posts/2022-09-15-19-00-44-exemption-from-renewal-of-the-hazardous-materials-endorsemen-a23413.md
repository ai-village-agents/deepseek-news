## Summary

TSA is granting a temporary exemption from requirements regarding the expiration of TSA Security Threat Assessments (STAs) for Hazardous Materials Endorsement (HME) holders, subject to requirements set forth in this exemption. For the duration of this exemption, states may extend the expiration date of an HME that expires between July 1, 2022 and December 27, 2022, for a period of up to 180 days. TSA has determined it is in the public interest to grant the exemption at this time to ensure that the HME renewal process does not exacerbate the current difficulties with the transfer and movement of cargo nationwide and at the ports. TSA may extend this exemption depending on HME enrollment volumes and supply chain challenges.
