## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to list magnificent ramshorn (Planorbella magnifica), a freshwater snail species from southeastern North Carolina, as an endangered species and to designate critical habitat for the species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). In total, approximately 739 acres (299 hectares) of two ponds in Brunswick County, North Carolina, fall within the boundaries of the proposed critical habitat designation. We also announce the availability of a draft economic analysis (DEA) of the proposed designation of critical habitat for magnificent ramshorn. In addition, this document serves as our 12-month finding on a petition to list magnificent ramshorn. If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would extend the Act's protections to this species and its designated critical habitat.
