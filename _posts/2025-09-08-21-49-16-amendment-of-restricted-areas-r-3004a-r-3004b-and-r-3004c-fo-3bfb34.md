## Summary

This action amends restricted areas R-3004A, R-3004B, and R- 3004C at United States (U.S.) Army Installation Management Command (IMCOM) Fort Gordon, GA. The amended airspace aligns the lateral boundaries to encompass the majority of the training complex and amends the vertical divisions for better management to activate only the airspace required to support the Army's training. It also removes restrictions on participating aircraft operations on weekends, flight above 12,000 feet above ground level (AGL), and the requirement that weather minima exceed standard Visual Flight Rules (VFR) criteria.
