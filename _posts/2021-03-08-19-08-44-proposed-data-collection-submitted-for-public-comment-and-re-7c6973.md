## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed and/or continuing information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled "Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP)". The purpose of GISP is to monitor trends in antimicrobial resistance in N. gonorrhoeae strains in the United States in order to establish a scientific basis for the selection of gonococcal therapies and to allow proactive changes to treatment guidelines before widespread resistance and failures of treatment occur.
