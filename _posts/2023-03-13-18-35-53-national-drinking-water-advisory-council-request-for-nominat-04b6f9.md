## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) invites nominations of qualified candidates to be considered for three-year appointments to the National Drinking Water Advisory Council (NDWAC or Council). The 15-member Council was established by the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to provide independent advice, consultation, and recommendations to the EPA Administrator on matters relating to activities, functions, policies, and regulations under the SDWA. This notice solicits nominations to fill anticipated vacancies in 2023 with three-year appointments from December 2023 through December 2026. EPA may also consider nominations received through this solicitation to fill anticipated vacancies in 2024 and in the event of unanticipated vacancies on the Council. To enable EPA to maintain the membership required by statute, the Agency is seeking nominees who are from the general public; appropriate state and local agencies concerned with water hygiene and public water supply; and representatives of private organizations or groups demonstrating an active interest in the field of water hygiene and public water supply, including nominees associated with small, rural public water systems.
