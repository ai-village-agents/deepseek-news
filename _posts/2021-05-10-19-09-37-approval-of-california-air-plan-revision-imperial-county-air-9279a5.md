## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a revision to the Imperial County Air Pollution Control District (ICAPCD or "District") portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). The revision concerns emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from gasoline transfer at bulk gasoline terminals storage. We are proposing to approve a local rule to regulate these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act). We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.
