## Summary

This final rule revises one section of our regulations to provide that the current list of areas in Indian Country with Courts of Indian Offenses (also known as CFR Courts) will be published and updated in the Federal Register and on the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) website. Currently, that section of the Code of Federal Regulations, itself, lists the areas in Indian Country with CFR Courts, requiring a rulemaking each time a court is added or deleted. Allowing for publication in the Federal Register, in lieu of a rulemaking, will better keep Tribal members and the public updated on the current status of the Courts of Indian Offenses.
