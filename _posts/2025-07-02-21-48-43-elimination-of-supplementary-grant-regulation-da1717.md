## Summary

Through this final rule, the Economic Development Administration (EDA), U.S. Department of Commerce, is eliminating the regulations on supplementary investment assistance. The regulation is confusing and does not provide any guidance in addition to what is already in section 205 of EDA's enabling statute, the Public Works, and Economic Development Act of 1965.
