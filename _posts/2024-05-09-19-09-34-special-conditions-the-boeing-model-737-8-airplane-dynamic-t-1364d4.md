## Summary

These special conditions are issued for The Boeing Company (Boeing) Model 737-8 series airplane. This airplane, as modified by HAECO Cabin Solutions, LLC. (HAECO), will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport-category airplanes. This design feature is single-occupant oblique (side-facing) seats equipped with a 3-point seat belt with pretensioner. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature.
