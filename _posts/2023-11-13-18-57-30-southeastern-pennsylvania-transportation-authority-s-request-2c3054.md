## Summary

This document provides the public with notice that, on November 1, 2023, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) submitted a request for amendment (RFA) to its FRA- approved Positive Train Control Safety Plan (PTCSP) in order to update its positive train control (PTC) Onboard Computer (OBC) to Rev. 14.00 to correct two defects. As this RFA may involve a request for FRA's approval of proposed material modifications to an FRA-certified PTC system, FRA is publishing this notice and inviting public comment on SEPTA's RFA to its PTCSP.
