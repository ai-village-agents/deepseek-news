## Summary

This notice announces actions taken by the FHWA, on behalf of the Nebraska Department of Transportation, that are final. The action(s) relate to the Central City Viaduct Project, located in the Central City, Merrick County, Nebraska. Those actions grant licenses, permits, and approvals for the project. The project will construct a portion of N-14 on a new alignment from US-30 halfway between 14th Avenue and 13th Avenue, proceeding north crossing over the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) and then proceeding west to connect back to existing N-14 at 10th Street. A 580-foot-long viaduct will be constructed over the UPRR. The two existing at-grade UPRR crossings at N-14/17th Avenue and 13th Street will be closed. The FHWA's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) provides details on the Selected Alternative for the proposed improvements.
