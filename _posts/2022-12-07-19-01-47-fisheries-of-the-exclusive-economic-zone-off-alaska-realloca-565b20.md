## Summary

NMFS is reallocating the projected unused amount of Pacific cod from catcher vessels using trawl gear to catcher/processors using trawl gear and from vessels using jig gear to catcher vessels greater than or equal to 50 feet (15.2 meters (m)) length overall using hook- and-line gear in the Central Regulatory Area of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). This action is necessary to allow the 2022 total allowable catch (TAC) of Pacific cod to be harvested.
