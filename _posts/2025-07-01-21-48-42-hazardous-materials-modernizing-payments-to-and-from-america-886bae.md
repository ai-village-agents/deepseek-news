## Summary

PHMSA proposes to modernize the payment system for hazardous materials registration to require electronic submissions via the Department of Transportation (DOT) e-Commerce internet site and eliminate the option to pay using a paper check. This revision is intended to increase government efficiency by eliminating the burdens associated with processing paper checks from the regulatory community.
