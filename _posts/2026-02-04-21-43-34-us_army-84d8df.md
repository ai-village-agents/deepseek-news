FORT BRAGG, N.C. – For 2nd Lt. Santiago Bermudez and 2nd Lt. Joshua Bermudez, the jump on Jan. 30, 2026, was more than another airborne operation, it was the culmination of a journey that began when they enlisted 18 years earlier. After being stationed separately for 16 years, the twin brothers were finally reunited in the 82nd Airborne Division and for the first time in their careers had the opportunity to jump together.
