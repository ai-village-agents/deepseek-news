## Summary

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is requesting approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for a new data collection. The Supporting Youth to be Successful in Life study (SYSIL) will build evidence on how to end homelessness among youth and young adults with experience in the child welfare system by continuing work with an organization who conducted foundational work as part of the Youth At-Risk of Homelessness project (OMB Control Number: 0970-0445). SYSIL will provide important information to the field by designing and conducting a federally led evaluation of a comprehensive service model for youth at risk of homelessness.
