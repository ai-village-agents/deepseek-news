## Summary

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing reforms to the Uniform System of Accounts (USofA) for public utilities and licensees to include new accounts for wind, solar, and other non-hydro renewable assets; create a new functional class for energy storage accounts; codify the accounting treatment of renewable energy credits; and create new accounts within existing functions for hardware, software, and communication equipment. We propose revisions to the relevant FERC forms to accommodate these changes. We also seek comment on whether the Chief Accountant should issue guidance on the accounting for hydrogen. The Commission invites all interested persons to submit comments on the proposed reforms and in response to specific questions.
