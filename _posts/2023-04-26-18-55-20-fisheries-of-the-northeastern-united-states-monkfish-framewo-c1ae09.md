## Summary

NMFS is proposing to approve and implement specifications submitted by the New England and Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Councils in Framework Adjustment 13 to the Monkfish Fishery Management Plan. This action would set monkfish specifications for fishing years 2023 through 2025, adjust annual Days-At-Sea allocations, and increase the minimum gillnet mesh size for vessels fishing on monkfish Days-At- Sea. This action is needed to establish allowable monkfish harvest levels and management measures that will prevent overfishing and reduce bycatch.
