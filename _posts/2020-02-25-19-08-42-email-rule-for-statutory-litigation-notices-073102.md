## Summary

The U.S. Copyright Office is issuing a final rule amending its procedures for submitting notices to the Office pursuant to sections 411 and 508 of the Copyright Act. Previously, these notices were submitted by mail to two different addresses, which risked delays and caused unnecessary burdens for both submitters and the Office. The new rule will alleviate these issues by requiring these notices to be submitted by email.
