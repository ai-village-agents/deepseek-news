## Summary

As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) announces that the Commission has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request for extension of approval of information collection requirements associated with the Safety Standard for Omnidirectional Citizens Band Base Station Antennas. OMB previously approved the collection of information under Control Number 3041-0006. OMB's most recent extension of approval will expire on September 30, 2025. On June 13, 2025, CPSC published a notice in the Federal Register to announce the agency's intention to seek extension of approval of the collection of information. The Commission did not receive any public comments. Therefore, by publication of this notice, the Commission announces that CPSC has submitted to the OMB a request for extension of approval of that collection of information.
