## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled Reducing Fatigue Among Taxi Drivers. The goal of this project is to evaluate two interventions, a training and a wrist-device that provide personalized daily fatigue scores, designed to enable taxi drivers to reduce their fatigue levels. This research study involves two parts: development of a fatigue management eLearning training tool designed for drivers-for-hire (e.g., taxi drivers; ride sourcing drivers); and an evaluation of the effectiveness of this training alone and paired with the wrist-device that provides personalized daily fatigue scores.
