## Summary

The Galveston District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) intends to prepare a Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) for the Sabine Pass to Galveston Bay, Orange County Project consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA, Pub. L. 91-190) as amended. On October 2, 2018, the Record of Decision (ROD) was signed for the Sabine Pass to Galveston Bay, Texas Coastal Storm Risk Management and Ecosystem Restoration Final Integrated Feasibility Report and Environmental Impact Statement (FIFR-EIS). The FIFR-EIS evaluated three distinct separable elements (projects) using a region-wide systems approach in Orange County, Port Arthur and Vicinity, and Freeport and Vicinity. The Orange County Project is currently in the pre-construction engineering and design phase (PED). The USACE is currently evaluating alternative alignments for the Orange County Project based on new technical analyses and stakeholder engagement. The currently identified alignments differ in location and the magnitude of environmental impacts from those evaluated in the FIFR-EIS. In accordance with NEPA and the Department of Defense NEPA implementing procedures, the USACE will prepare a SEIS to document and disclose the impacts of substantial changes to the proposed action and new information that are relevant to environmental concerns. The USACE is seeking public input on the scope of the SEIS, effects, additional alternatives, public concerns, and relevant information, studies, or analyses for the proposed action.
