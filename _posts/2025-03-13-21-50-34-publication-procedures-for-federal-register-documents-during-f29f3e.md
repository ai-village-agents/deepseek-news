## Summary

During an appropriations lapse, the Office of the Federal Register (OFR) publishes documents directly related to the performance of governmental functions necessary to address imminent threats to the safety of human life or protection of property and may publish documents related to funded programs if delaying publication until the end of the appropriations lapse would prevent or significantly damage the execution of funded functions at the agency. The OFR is prohibited by law from publishing any other agency documents. The OFR does not make case-by-case determinations as to whether certain documents are directly related to activities that qualify for an exemption under the Antideficiency Act. It is the responsibility of the agency submitting a document for publication to provide justification and certify that the document is authorized under the Antideficiency Act.
