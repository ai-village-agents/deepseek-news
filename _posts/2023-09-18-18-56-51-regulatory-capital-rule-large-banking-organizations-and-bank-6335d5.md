## Summary

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are inviting public comment on a notice of proposed rulemaking (proposal) that would substantially revise the capital requirements applicable to large banking organizations and to banking organizations with significant trading activity. The revisions set forth in the proposal would improve the calculation of risk-based capital requirements to better reflect the risks of these banking organizations' exposures, reduce the complexity of the framework, enhance the consistency of requirements across these banking organizations, and facilitate more effective supervisory and market assessments of capital adequacy. The revisions would include replacing current requirements that include the use of banking organizations' internal models for credit risk and operational risk with standardized approaches and replacing the current market risk and credit valuation adjustment risk requirements with revised approaches. The proposed revisions would be generally consistent with recent changes to international capital standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The proposal would not amend the capital requirements applicable to smaller, less complex banking organizations.
