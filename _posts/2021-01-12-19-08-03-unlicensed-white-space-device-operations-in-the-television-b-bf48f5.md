## Summary

In this document, the Commission revises its rules to expand the ability of unlicensed white space devices to deliver wireless broadband services in rural areas and areas where fewer broadcast television stations are on the air. The Commission also modifies its rules to facilitate the development of new and innovative narrowband Internet of Things (IoT) devices in TV white spaces. Unlicensed white space devices operate in the VHF and UHF broadcast TV bands, a spectral region that has excellent propagation characteristics that are particularly attractive for delivering wireless communications services over long distances, varying terrain, and into and within buildings. The Commission adopts a number of changes to the white space device rules to spur continued growth of the white space ecosystem, especially for providing affordable broadband service to rural and unserved communities that can help close the digital divide, while at the same time protecting broadcast television stations in the band from harmful interference.
