## Summary

This action implements Framework Adjustment 17 to the Summer Flounder, Scup, and Black Sea Bass Fishery Management Plan and Framework Adjustment 6 to the Bluefish Fishery Management Plan. This framework was developed by the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council in conjunction with the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission to revise the process for setting recreational management measures and recreational accountability measures for summer flounder, scup, black sea bass, and bluefish. Recreational management and accountability measures prevent overfishing while balancing recreational fishing opportunities.
