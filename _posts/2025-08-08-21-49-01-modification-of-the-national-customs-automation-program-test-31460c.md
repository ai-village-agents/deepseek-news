## Summary

On February 12, 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) published a notice in the Federal Register extending and modifying a National Customs Automation Program Test concerning the submission of unique entity identifiers for the Global Business Identifier (GBI) Evaluative Proof of Concept (EPoC). This document republishes and supersedes that notice, renames the GBI EPoC to the Global Business Identifier Test (GBI Test), adds Altana Technologies USG Inc. (Altana) as a new Identity Management Company (IMC), and establishes a process for other IMCs to support CBP in the test.
