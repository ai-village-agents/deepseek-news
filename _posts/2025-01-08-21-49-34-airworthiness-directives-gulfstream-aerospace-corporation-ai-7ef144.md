## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation Model GVII-G500 and GVII-G600 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of cracking in the electrical grounding receptacles located on the left and right wings. This AD requires inspecting the electrical grounding receptacles for cracks and corrosion, performing applicable on-condition actions, and sealing over the grounding receptacles on the top of the wings to permanently disable the receptacle. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
