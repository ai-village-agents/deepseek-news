## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves an automated application process for employment with the Federal Aviation Administration by way of the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) USAJOBS website: www.usajobs.gov. The Applicants begin the application process by building an account on USAJOBS website and thereafter, they are passed into the FAA Automated Vacancy Information Access Tool for Online Referral (AVIATOR) to answer specific questions related to FAA job vacancy of interest. This pass through is a direct USAJOBS interface with AVIATOR and hence, there is no standalone link to be used by the applicants. The information collected is necessary to determine basic eligibility for employment and potential eligibility for Veteran's Preference, Veteran's Readjustment Act, and People with Disability appointments. In addition, there are specific occupation questions that assist the FAA Office of Human Resource Management (AHR) in determining candidates' qualifications in order that the best-qualified candidates are hired for the many FAA occupations.
