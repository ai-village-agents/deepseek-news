## Summary

On January 3, 2023, the Coast Guard published a notice announcing the availability of a draft report of an Approaches to Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts Port Access Route Study (MNMPARS). The notice we sent to the Office of the Federal Register provided for a 30-day comment period. But when the notice was published it listed a past date, February 2, 2022, as the end of the comment period. This document extends the intended comment period to a full 30 days from the date of publication of this notice. The Coast Guard seeks comments on the content, proposed routing measures, and development of the report. The recommendations of MNMPARS study may lead to future rulemakings or appropriate international agreements.
