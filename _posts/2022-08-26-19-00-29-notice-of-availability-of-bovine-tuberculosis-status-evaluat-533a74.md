## Summary

We are advising the public that we are proposing to classify eight Mexican regions for bovine tuberculosis as follows: The State of Sonora as Level II; the Yucat[aacute]n Peninsula region (States of Yucat[aacute]n and Quintana Roo, and part of the State of Campeche), the Huasteca region (parts of the States of Puebla, Veracruz, and Hidalgo), part of the State of Chihuahua, and part of the State of Durango as Level III; and part of the State of Coahuila, part of the State of Nuevo Le[oacute]n, and the State of Tamaulipas as Level IV. These proposed recognitions are based on an evaluation we have prepared in connection with this action, which we are making available for review and comment.
