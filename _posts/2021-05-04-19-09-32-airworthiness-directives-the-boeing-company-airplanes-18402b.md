## Summary

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-22- 10, which applied to all The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER series airplanes. AD 2019-22-10 required repetitive inspections for cracking of the left- and right-hand side outboard chords of frame fittings and failsafe straps at a certain station around eight fasteners, and repair if any cracking is found. For certain airplanes, this AD reduces the compliance time for the initial inspection, and for all airplanes this AD reduces the repetitive interval. This AD was prompted by a determination that the initial inspection threshold and repetitive inspection interval are inadequate to address the cracking in a timely manner. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
