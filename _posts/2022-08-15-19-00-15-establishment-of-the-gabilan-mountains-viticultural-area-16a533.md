## Summary

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) establishes the approximately 98,000-acre "Gabilan Mountains" viticultural area in Monterey and San Benito Counties, in California. The newly- established Gabilan Mountains viticultural area is located entirely within the existing Central Coast viticultural area and entirely encompasses the existing Mt. Harlan and Chalone viticultural areas. TTB designates viticultural areas to allow vintners to better describe the origin of their wines and to allow consumers to better identify wines they may purchase.
