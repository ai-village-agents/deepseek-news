## Summary

The Office of National Marine Sanctuaries of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is requesting written comments to facilitate ONMS' five year review of the nomination for the Lake Erie Quadrangle National Marine Sanctuary (NMS). In particular, NOAA is requesting relevant information as it pertains to its evaluation criteria for inclusion in the inventory (these criteria are detailed at https://nominate.noaa.gov/guide.html). In this five year review, NOAA will pay particular attention to any new information about the nomination's resources, changes to any threats towards these resources, and any updates to the management framework of the area. NOAA will also assess the continuity and breadth of community-based support for the nomination. NOAA has provided the original nominating party an opportunity to share its views on these same questions. Following this information gathering and internal analysis, NOAA will make a final determination on whether or not the Lake Erie Quadrangle NMS nomination will remain in the inventory for another five year period.
