## Summary

This interim final rule codifies standards and procedures the Department of Energy will follow when developing and carrying out voluntary agreements and plans of action under the Defense Production Act. The Defense Production Act provides a defense from antitrust laws with respect to any action taken to develop or carry out any voluntary agreement or plan of action when certain criteria are met. The rule will apply the Defense Production Act's long-standing provisions and will be set out in a new and dedicated part in the Code of Federal Regulations.
