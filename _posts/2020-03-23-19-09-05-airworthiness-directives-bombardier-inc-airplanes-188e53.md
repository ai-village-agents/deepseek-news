## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-1A11 (600), CL-600-2A12 (601), and CL-600-2B16 (601-3A, 601-3R, and 604 Variants) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that fast and easy access to the portable oxygen bottle may be prevented by the portable oxygen bottle installation's upper bracket latch assembly catching on the pressure gauge tube or on the pressure gauge bezel of the portable oxygen bottle. This proposed AD would require a check to identify the manufacturer and part number of the portable oxygen bottle installation, and, if necessary, modification of the portable oxygen bottle installation. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
