## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, are initiating 5-year status reviews for 122 species in Hawaii, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. A 5-year status review is based on the best scientific and commercial data available at the time of the review; therefore, we are requesting submission of any new information on these species that has become available since the last reviews.
