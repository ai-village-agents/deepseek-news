## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing a proposed interpretation of its low-level radioactive waste disposal regulations that would permit licensees to dispose of waste by transfer to persons who hold specific exemptions for the purpose of disposal. The NRC will consider approval of requests for specific exemptions for the purpose of disposal if they are for the disposal of very low-level radioactive waste by land burial. Therefore, the NRC's intent is that this interpretive rule will allow licensees to transfer very low-level radioactive waste to exempt persons for the purpose of disposal by land burial. The NRC is requesting comment on this proposed interpretive rule.
