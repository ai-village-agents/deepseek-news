## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is finalizing an extension to the compliance dates applicable to certain entities subject to the regulation of methylene chloride promulgated under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Specifically, EPA is finalizing an 18-month extension of the Workplace Chemical Protection Program (WCPP) and associated recordkeeping compliance dates for industrial or commercial laboratories that are not owned or operated by Federal agencies or contractors acting on behalf of the Federal government. Under this final rule, all non-Federal laboratories will share the same compliance dates with Federal and Federally contracted laboratories. EPA is finalizing an extension of the compliance dates for associated laboratory activities detailed in this final rule to avoid disruption of important functions of non-Federal laboratories such as the use of environmental monitoring methods needed for cleanup sites and wastewater treatment, as well as activities associated with university laboratories or law enforcement laboratories.
