## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of its continuing effort to reduce public burden and maximize the utility of government information, invites the general public and other Federal agencies the opportunity to comment on a proposed information collection, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites comment on a proposed information collection project titled U.S. National Authority for Containment of Poliovirus (U.S. NAC) Data Collection Tools. Data collection will capture information relating to a poliovirus containment breach or incident at a U.S. facility and will assist the U.S. NAC in the initial stages of the investigation into the breach, and ensure that facilities have programs in place that align with global poliovirus eradication initiative.
