## Summary

The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services published a notice in the Federal Register on September 30, 2025 inviting public comments on a request to extend approval of forms approved for the Placement and Transfer of Unaccompanied [Alien] Children into ORR Care Provider Facilities. Prior to publishing the notice, ORR received emergency approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for revisions to two forms included in this collection of forms: Form P-7 and Form P-4. The incorrect version of form P-7 was inadvertently approved and distributed for public comment.
