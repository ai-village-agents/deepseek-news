## Summary

Pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended 5 U.S.C. 552a, the Department of the Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) is issuing a public notice of its intent to establish a Privacy Act System of Records titled, "Anti-Harassment Program". The Anti-Harassment Program's (AHP) intent is to provide the entire HUD workforce accountability for professional conduct, a mechanism for reporting unwelcome conduct, and prevent potentially harassing activity and promptly correct harassing behaviors. The AHP promotes a "speak-up" culture, bolsters employee morale, and increases employee engagement, satisfaction, and retention. The AHP prevents all harassing conduct before the conduct can become severe or pervasive. As such, the Anti- Harassment Program (AHP) is a mission imperative for all stakeholders.
