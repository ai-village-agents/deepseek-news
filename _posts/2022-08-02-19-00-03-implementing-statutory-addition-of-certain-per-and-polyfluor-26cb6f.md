## Summary

EPA is issuing a correction to a final rule that published in the Federal Register on Monday, July 18, 2022. The document updated the list of chemicals subject to toxic chemical release reporting under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) and the Pollution Prevention Act (PPA). Specifically, the action updated the regulations to identify five per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) that must be reported pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (FY2020 NDAA) enacted on December 20, 2019. This document corrects inadvertent errors in the preamble and the amendatory instructions that appeared in the regulatory text portion of the final rule.
