## Summary

Subject to valid existing rights, this order withdraws 103.92 acres of Bureau of Land Management (BLM)-administered public lands in Douglas County, Oregon from location and entry under the United States mining laws, but not from leasing under the mineral and geothermal leasing laws, for a period of 20 years to protect the unique recreational values at three public recreation sites. This Public Land Order (PLO) would also withdraw an additional 38.5 acres of non-Federal lands and an additional 21.20 acres of non-Federal subsurface mineral interests in the same manner described in the PLO, should the United States acquire such lands or interests in land in the future.
