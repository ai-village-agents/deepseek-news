## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is seeking public nominations of scientific and technical experts that EPA can consider for service as ad hoc reviewers assisting the Science Advisory Committee on Chemicals (SACC) with the peer review of the Agency's evaluation of the risks from formaldehyde being conducted to inform risk management decisions under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) programs. EPA expects to ask the SACC to consider and review the Office of Pollution, Prevention, and Toxics (OPPT) and the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) joint hazard assessments for human and ecological health; and the OPPT exposure and risk characterizations. This SACC peer review is in addition to prior external peer reviews by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), the EPA's Human Studies Review Board (HSRB) and the SACC. The Agency is leveraging these peer reviews to support further development of the risk evaluation of formaldehyde. To facilitate nominations, this document provides information about the SACC, the intended topic for the planned peer review, the expertise sought for this peer review, instructions for submitting nominations to EPA, and the Agency's plan for selecting the ad hoc reviewers for this peer review.
