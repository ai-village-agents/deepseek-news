## Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is amending its medical regulations to add chiropractic services to the definitions of medical services and preventive care. VA will further revise the definition of medical services to include rehabilitative services consistent with its statutory definition and to reflect changes made in other VA medical regulations and in prior legislation not previously codified. The amendments will make the amended regulations consistent with current practices, prior changes in law and other VA medical regulations, and changes in law made by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. These amendments will not substantively change the current administration of medical benefits to veterans.
