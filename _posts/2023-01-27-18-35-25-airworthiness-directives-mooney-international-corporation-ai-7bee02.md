## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Mooney International Corporation Model M20C, M20D, M20E, M20F, and M20G airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of the hybrid material elevator balance weight cracking. This AD requires inspecting to determine whether a certain elevator balance weight is installed. If installed, this AD requires inspecting each affected elevator balance weight for corrosion and cracking, and depending on the findings, either replacing each affected elevator balance weight with a non- hybrid (lead) elevator balance weight or repetitively inspecting each affected elevator balance weight. This AD also prohibits the installation of an affected elevator balance weight on any airplane. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
