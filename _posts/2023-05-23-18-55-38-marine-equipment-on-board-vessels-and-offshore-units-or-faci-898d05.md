## Summary

The Coast Guard proposes to revise regulations associated with the approval, carriage, and maintenance of certain safety equipment required on board vessels and offshore units or facilities. We are taking this action to align the regulations with the current industry practice and provide more transparent regulations for the regulated industry. These proposed revisions would eliminate outdated requirements, reduce inspection and testing requirements, and update standards incorporated by reference. Additionally, this project would remove obsolete sections and align conflicting sections with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea.
