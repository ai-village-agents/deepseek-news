## Summary

In accordance with the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), as amended, its implementing regulations, and NMFS' MMPA Regulations for Taking Marine Mammals Incidental to Construction of the Empire Wind Offshore Wind Project Offshore of New York, notification is hereby given that upon request from Empire Wind, LLC (Empire Wind), NMFS has modified a Letter of Authorization (LOA) issued to Empire Wind for the take of marine mammals incidental to activities associated with construction of the Empire Wind Offshore Wind Energy Project (hereafter known as the "Project") in Federal and State waters offshore New York. Specifically, NMFS has modified the LOA Holder's name as well as mitigation and monitoring measures related to vessel strike avoidance, sound field verification reporting, and requirements for passive acoustic monitoring (PAM). NMFS has also made modifications to additional measures to improve clarify and better align with the Biological Opinion. NMFS has determined that these modifications do not change the findings made for the regulations and does not result in any change in the total estimated number of takes of marine mammals.
