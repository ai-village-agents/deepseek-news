PANAMA CITY, Fla. (Feb. 18, 2026) — Sailors assigned to Naval Support Activity Panama City conduct an oil spill containment (boom) drill to enhance response readiness and protect local waterways. Navy Port Operations personnel deployed floating hard-shell booms, operated skimmer boats, and utilized absorbent materials to contain a simulated fuel leak during the high-stakes exercise. The drill reinforces environmental protection procedures and ensures rapid, compliant response capabilities to potential maritime spills.
