U.S. Army Soldiers from Bravo Battery, 1st Battalion, 14th Field Artillery Regiment, 75th Field Artillery Brigade, assigned to Task Force Pergalė and Lithuanian Armed Forces pose for a photo in front of an M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System during a static display, Feb. 3, 2026 in Klaipėda, Lithuania. The exercise marks the culminating event of the HIMARS apprenticeship program, during which the U.S. Soldiers trained Lithuanian forces in the operation, maintenance, and sustainment of the HIMARS. The event underscores Lithuanian’s investment in defense modernization, demonstrating how advanced capabilities provide credible deterrence and strengthen the Eastern Flank Deterrence Line.
