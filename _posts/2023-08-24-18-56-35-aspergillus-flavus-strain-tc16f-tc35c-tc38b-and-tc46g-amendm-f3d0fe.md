## Summary

This regulation amends the existing temporary tolerance exemptions for residues of Aspergillus flavus strains TC16F, TC35C, TC38B, and TC46G by establishing permanent tolerance exemptions for use in or on all food and feed commodities of field corn, popcorn, and sweet corn. Interregional Research Project Number 4 (IR-4) submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting to amend the existing temporary tolerance exemptions for Aspergillus flavus strains TC16F, TC35C, TC38B, and TC46G. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of Aspergillus flavus strains TC16F, TC35C, TC38B, and TC46G under FFDCA when used in accordance with label directions and good agricultural practices.
