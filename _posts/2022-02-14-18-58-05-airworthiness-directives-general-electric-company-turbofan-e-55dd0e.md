## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all General Electric Company (GE) Passport 20-17BB1A, Passport 20-18BB1A, and Passport 20-19BB1A model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by a report of a manufacturing quality escape that requires a reduction to the life limit of certain high-pressure turbine (HPT) rotor stage 1 disks. This AD requires revising the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the existing maintenance manual and the operator's existing approved continuous airworthiness maintenance program (CAMP) to incorporate a reduced life limit for certain HPT rotor stage 1 disks. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
