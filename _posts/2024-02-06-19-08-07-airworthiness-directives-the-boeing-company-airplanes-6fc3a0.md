## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that the flight deck door decompression panel can strike the captain's seat headrest if a flight deck decompression event occurs when the seat is in a certain position. This proposed AD would require, for certain airplanes, replacing the affected captain's seat assembly. This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
