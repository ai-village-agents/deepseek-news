## Summary

NMFS announces approval of an application to intentionally take, by lethal methods, California sea lions (CSL; Zalophus californianus) and Steller sea lions (SSL; Eumetopias jubatus: Eastern stock) that are located in the mainstem of the Columbia River between river mile 112 (I-205 bridge) and river mile 292 (McNary Dam), or in any tributary to the Columbia River that includes spawning habitat of threatened or endangered salmon or steelhead (Onchorynchus spp.). This action is intended to reduce or eliminate sea lion predation on species that are listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973, and species of lamprey or sturgeon that are not listed as endangered or threatened but are listed as a species of concern by the state of Oregon. This authorization is pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). NMFS also announces availability of decision documents and other information relied upon in making this determination.
