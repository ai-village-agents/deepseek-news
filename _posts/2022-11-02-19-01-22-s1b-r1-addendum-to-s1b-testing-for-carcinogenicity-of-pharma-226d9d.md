## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled "S1B(R1) Addendum to S1B Testing for Carcinogenicity of Pharmaceuticals." The guidance was prepared under the auspices of the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), formerly the International Conference on Harmonisation. The final guidance expands the testing scheme for assessing human carcinogenic risk of pharmaceuticals by introducing an additional approach that is not described in the original S1B Guideline. The final guidance is intended to offer an integrative approach that provides specific weight of evidence criteria that inform whether a 2-year rat study is likely to add value in completing a human carcinogenicity risk assessment. The Addendum also adds a plasma exposure ratio-based approach for setting the high dose in the rasH2-Tg mouse model, while all other aspects of the recommendations for high-dose selection in ICH guidance for industry "S1C(R2) Dose Selection for Carcinogenicity Studies of Pharmaceuticals" still apply.
