## Summary

On September 11, 2024, the Department of Energy ("DOE") received a petition from Dyson Inc. for DOE to revoke the procedures by which manufacturers must measure and represent to consumers the effective room size coverage and integrated energy factor of their air cleaner products. If the provisions are not revoked, Dyson Inc. requested that DOE stay enforcement of these provisions pending a new notice and comment period regarding potential amendments to these provisions. DOE is not revoking or staying enforcement of the test procedure and representations provisions raised in Dyson's petition at this time. Through this notification, DOE is seeking views on whether it should grant the petition and undertake a rulemaking to consider the proposal contained in the petition, as well as any data or information that could be used in DOE's determination whether to grant the petition.
