## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing the approval of a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Tennessee through the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC), through a letter date June 1, 2021. The SIP submittal revises SIP requirements regarding the installation, maintenance, and termination of ambient air sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) monitors near large industrial SO<INF>2</INF> emitting sources in the State. EPA is approving the adoption of the changes to the Tennessee Air Pollution Control Regulations (TAPCR) related to the control of SO<INF>2</INF> emissions into the SIP. EPA's analysis indicates that this SIP revision would not interfere with attainment or maintenance of any national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or standards) or any other Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) requirements.
