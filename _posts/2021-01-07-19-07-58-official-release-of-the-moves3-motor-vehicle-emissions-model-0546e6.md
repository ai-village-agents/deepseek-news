## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the availability of the MOtor Vehicle Emission Simulator model (MOVES3) for official purposes outside of California. MOVES3 is the latest state-of- the art upgrade to EPA's modeling tools for estimating emissions from cars, trucks, buses, and motorcycles based on the latest data and regulations. MOVES3 is available for use in state implementation plans (SIPs) and transportation conformity analyses outside of California. This notice starts a two-year grace period before MOVES3 will need to be used as the latest EPA emissions model in new regional emissions analyses and a two-year grace period before MOVES3 will need to be used in new hot-spot analyses for transportation conformity determinations outside of California.
