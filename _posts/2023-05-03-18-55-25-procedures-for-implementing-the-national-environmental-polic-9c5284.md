## Summary

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is proposing to amend and update its regulations for implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). The proposed amendments would update NASA's regulations to better align with the Agency's current and near future actions, adjust the level of NEPA review and documentation required for certain actions, and provide more concise descriptions of NASA actions. Additionally, consistent with NASA's requirement to review existing Categorical Exclusions (CatExs) at least every seven years to determine whether modifications, additions, or deletions are appropriate, this proposed rule incorporates updates to NASA's CatExs based on that review.
