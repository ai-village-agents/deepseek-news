## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A319-115 airplanes; Model A320-214, -216, - 232, -251N, and -271N airplanes; and Model A321-211, -231, -251N, - 251NX, -253N, -271N, -271NX, and -272N airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of incomplete installations of the over wing panel lug attachments in the production assembly line. This AD requires a one- time detailed inspection of certain attaching points on the left-hand and right-hand wings for the correct installation of certain hardware, and, depending on findings, accomplishment of applicable corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
