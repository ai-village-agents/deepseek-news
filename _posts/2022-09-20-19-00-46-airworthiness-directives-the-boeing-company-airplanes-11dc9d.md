## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 747-400 and 747-8 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of three opened door 5 right ceiling stowage boxes that fell freely and injured a flight attendant in each event. For certain airplanes, this proposed AD would require replacing certain snubbers of the door 5 ceiling stowage boxes and, for certain other airplanes, replacing certain snubbers and changing the location of the snubber attachments. This proposed AD would also require an operation check of the stowage boxes or snubber, as applicable, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
