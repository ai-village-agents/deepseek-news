## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FMCSA announces its plan to submit the Information Collection Request (ICR) described below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review and approval and invites public comment. FMCSA requests approval to renew the ICR titled "Licensing Applications for Motor Carrier Operating Authority," OMB Control No. 2126-0016. This ICR applies to: (1) Existing registrants (i.e., entities that already have a USDOT number and/or operating authority) that are subject to FMCSA's licensing, registration, and certification regulations that wish to apply for additional authorities; and (2) Mexico-domiciled carriers that wish to operate beyond the U.S. municipalities on the U.S.-Mexico border and their commercial zones. Existing registrants seeking additional authorities must use forms OP-1, OP-1(P), OP-1(FF), and OP- 1(NNA), to apply for such authority. Mexico-domiciled carriers seeking the authority described above must apply for such authority using Form OP-1(MX).
