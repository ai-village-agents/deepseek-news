## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, as the lead Federal agency, in conjunction with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as a cooperating agency, announce the availability of a draft environmental assessment (EA) for the proposed Salt River Project Roosevelt Habitat Conservation Plan (RHCP) Amendment which includes a proposed planned deviation to the Corps' Water Control Manual (WCM) in Gila and Maricopa Counties, Arizona. Salt River Project (applicant) submitted the RHCP amendment, also available for public review, in support of an application for an amended incidental take permit (permit) under the Endangered Species Act. Prepared in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, the draft EA evaluates the impacts of, and alternatives to, amending the existing permit for the operation of the Modified Roosevelt Dam and Lake. If approved, the requested permit amendment would authorize incidental take of the northern Mexican gartersnake and expand the permit area for existing authorized incidental take for the yellow-billed cuckoo, southwestern willow flycatcher, and bald eagle. We invite comments from the public and Federal, Tribal, State, and local governments.
