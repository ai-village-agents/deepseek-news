## Summary

The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) proposes to amend Regulation F, which implements the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) and currently contains the procedures for State application for exemption from the provisions of the FDCPA. On May 21, 2019, the Bureau published in the Federal Register a proposed rule (May 2019 Proposed Rule) that would prescribe Federal rules governing the activities of debt collectors, as that term is defined in the FDCPA. This proposal supplements the May 2019 Proposed Rule by proposing to require debt collectors to make certain disclosures when collecting time-barred debts.
