## Summary

This action proposes to establish Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface at Owyhee Airport, Owyhee, NV. The establishment of airspace facilitates the airport's transition from visual flight rules to instrument flight rules (IFR) operations. The airspace, to the extent possible, contains a new IFR area navigation (RNAV) approach and IFR departure procedures at the airport. The first proposed area extends upward from 700 feet above the surface. The second proposed area extends upward from 1,200 feet above the surface. This action would ensure the safety and management of IFR operations at the airport.
