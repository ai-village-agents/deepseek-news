## Summary

In April 2023, the Commission issued a revised proposed rule refining proposed changes to the "primary management official" and "key employee" definitions as well as the newly proposed definitions for "Gaming Enterprise" and "Tribal Gaming Regulatory Authority" (TGRA). The revised proposal, like the 2022 original, also proposed: modernizing retention requirements for background investigations and licensing applications; vesting revocation hearing rights upon license issuance as well as in accordance with tribal law, regulation, or policy; and augmenting revocation decision notification and submission requirements. After closely considering comments received, this final rule permits tribes to designate other gaming enterprise employees as key employees and other employed gaming enterprise management officials as primary management officials, including TGRA personnel. These optional designations occur by any documentary means. Further, the key employee definition no longer sets forth a wage threshold but includes in the definition a gaming operation's four most highly compensated persons. And the terms "independent" and "governmental" have been struck from the TGRA definition, aligning it with a corresponding definition in NIGC regulations, part 547. Lastly, license revocation decisions only require notifying the Commission of the revocation along with a copy of the revocation decision.
