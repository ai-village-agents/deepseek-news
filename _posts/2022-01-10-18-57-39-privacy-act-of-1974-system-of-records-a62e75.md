## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to modify, retitle, and reissue a current DHS system of records titled, "DHS/U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)-025 National Frontline Recruitment Hiring System of Records." This system of records allows DHS/CBP to collect and maintain records on individuals for the purpose of marketing information related to CBP employment, managing communication with potential applicants or individuals who attend career fairs or meetings at which CBP maintains a presence for recruitment and hiring, and for other recruitment and hiring activities for which mailing or contact lists may be created. DHS/CBP is updating this system of records notice to (1) change the name of the system of records to "CBP Recruitment and Hiring System of Records;" (2) expand the category of individuals covered by the system to include all potential applicants for employment with CBP; (3) update the authority for maintenance of this system; (4) modify the retention and disposal of records; and (5) expand the category of records to include disability status and education. Additionally, this notice includes non-substantive changes to simplify the formatting and text of the previously published notice. This modified system will be included in DHS's inventory of record systems.
