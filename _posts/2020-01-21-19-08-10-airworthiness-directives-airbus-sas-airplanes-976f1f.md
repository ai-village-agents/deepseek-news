# Airworthiness Directives; Airbus SAS Airplanes

## Summary

The FAA is revising an earlier proposal for all Airbus SAS Model A330-200, A330-200 Freighter, A330-300, A340-200, A340-300, A340- 500, and A340-600 series airplanes. This action revises the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) by including additional affected free fall actuators (FFAs) and reducing certain compliance times. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive (AD) to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over those in the NPRM, the FAA is reopening the comment period to allow the public the chance to comment on these changes.
