## Summary

We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), are announcing receipt of a proposed amendment to the North Dakota regulatory program (hereinafter, the North Dakota program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). North Dakota proposes changes to the North Dakota Century Code and North Dakota Administrative Code resulting from actions initiated during both the 2017 and 2021 Legislative Sessions. Changes include altering the time required for scheduling and applying for select permit related actions, creation of the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality and a transfer of select responsibilities from the Department of Health, establishment of the Department of Water Resources, and the powers and duties of that agency and the state engineer. This document gives the times and locations that the North Dakota program and this proposed amendment to that program are available for your inspection, the comment period during which you may submit written comments on the amendment, and the procedures that we will follow for the public hearing, if one is requested.
