## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing this document to modify and supplement its proposed rule issued on January 11, 2021, in which the Agency proposed updates and adjustments to the 2018 Fee Rule established under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). With over five years of experience administering the TSCA amendments of 2016, EPA is publishing this document to ensure that the fees charged accurately reflect the level of effort and resources needed to implement TSCA in the manner envisioned by Congress when it reformed the law. Additionally, the purpose of this document is to propose narrowing certain proposed exemptions for entities subject to the EPA-initiated risk evaluation fees and propose exemptions for the test rule fee activities; to propose modifications to the self- identification and reporting requirements for EPA-initiated risk evaluation and test rule fees; to propose a partial refund of fees for premanufacture notices withdrawn at any time after the first 10 business days during the assessment period of the chemical; to propose modifications to EPA's proposed methodology for the production volume- based fee allocation for EPA-initiated risk evaluation fees in any scenario where a consortium is not formed; to propose expanding the fee requirements to companies required to submit information for test orders; to propose modifying the fee payment obligations to require payment by processors subject to test orders and enforceable consent agreements (ECA); to propose extending the timeframe for test order and test rule payments; as well as to propose changes to the fee amounts and the estimate of EPA's total costs for administering TSCA.
