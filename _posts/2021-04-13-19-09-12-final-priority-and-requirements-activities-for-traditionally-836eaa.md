## Summary

The Department of Education (Department) announces a priority and requirements under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (Rehabilitation Act) for Activities for Traditionally Underserved Populations, Assistance Listing Number 84.315C. The Department may use this priority and requirements for competitions in fiscal year (FY) 2021 and later years. We take this action to focus attention on an identified national need to fund activities for traditionally underserved populations. Awards will be made to minority entities and Indian Tribes to conduct research, training and technical assistance, and related activities to improve services under the Rehabilitation Act, especially services provided to individuals from minority backgrounds. As defined in the Rehabilitation Act, a minority entity means an entity that is a historically Black college or university, a Hispanic-serving institution of higher education, an American Indian tribal college or university, or another institute of higher education whose minority student enrollment is at least 50 percent.
