## Summary

The Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) (collectively, the Agencies) are proposing changes to the Uniform Rules of Practice and Procedure (Uniform Rules) to recognize the use of electronic communications in all aspects of administrative hearings and to otherwise increase the efficiency and fairness of administrative adjudications. The OCC, Board, and FDIC are also proposing to modify their agency-specific rules of administrative practice and procedure (Local Rules). The OCC also proposes to integrate its Uniform Rules and Local Rules so that one set of rules applies to both national banks and Federal savings associations and to amend its rules on organization and functions to address service of process.
