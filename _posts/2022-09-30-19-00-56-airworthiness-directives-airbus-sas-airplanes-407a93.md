## Summary

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A330-200, A330-200 Freighter, A330-300, A330- 800, A330-900, A340-200, A340-300, A340-500, and A340-600 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that an A319 airplane lost the right-hand front windshield in flight. Due to the design similarity, this condition can also exist or develop on Model A330 and A340 airplanes. This proposed AD would require repetitive detailed inspections (DET) and electrical test measurements (ETM) of the affected parts and applicable corrective action, and would prohibit the installation of affected parts under certain conditions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
