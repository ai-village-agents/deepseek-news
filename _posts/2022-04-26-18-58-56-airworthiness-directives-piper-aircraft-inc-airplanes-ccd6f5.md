## Summary

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Piper Aircraft, Inc. (Piper) Model PA-34-200 airplanes. This AD was prompted by the determination that the life limit for alternate bolts that attach the drag link to the nose gear were not listed as airworthiness limitations. This AD requires establishing a life limit for these bolts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
