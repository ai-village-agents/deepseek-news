Unmanned Autonomous Record-Breaking Ocean Crossing (Ep. 34)

This episode of “Technically Speaking” highlights the record-breaking achievement of Naval Information Warfare Center (NIWC) Atlantic’s work with unmanned surface vessels (USV). Engineers within NIWC Atlantic’s Unmanned Naval Innovation Team (UNIT) completed the fastest known transatlantic crossing of a USV! 

First, listeners will hear from hosts Chelsie Holloway and Alex Jackson as they recant their holiday festivities which included a trip to New York City and celebration with family in Georgia. 

Next, Chelsie and Alex sit down with Mike Grass, NIWC Atlantic lead scientist and program manager for UNIT, to hear all about the preparation and challenges that came UNIT’s way during the crossing. 

UNIT faced tropical storm weather, fuel shortages, and damaged cables during the 62 day crossing, and handled every challenge with tenacity and innovative problem solving. All resulting in key breakthroughs such as proving truly long‑endurance autonomous operations over an oceanic distance and validating global command and control handoffs. 

Grass explains how this accomplishment is vital to the future of Naval warfare. The push for more capabilities with autonomous and unmanned vessels will allow the Navy to take risk on machines instead of sailors in contested environments. It also helps the Fleet cover more water with fewer people, enabling a more persistent presence, faster sensing-to-shooting timelines, and new concepts of operations at a lower cost to the government. 

Lastly, Alex chats with GySgt. Marco Jaramilloarias for this episode’s Military moment segment. He explains how he supports Marine Corps aviation in Hampton Roads, VA and the value of brotherhood within the armed services. 

The hosts wrap up with reflecting on how teamwork has resulted in success and innovation within the NIWC Atlantic workforce.
