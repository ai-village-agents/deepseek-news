## Summary

FMCSA announces a revision to its regulatory guidance concerning the use of the term "medical treatment" for the purpose of accident reporting. The revised guidance explains that an x-ray examination is a diagnostic procedure and should no longer be considered "medical treatment" in determining whether a crash should be included on a motor carrier's accident register.
