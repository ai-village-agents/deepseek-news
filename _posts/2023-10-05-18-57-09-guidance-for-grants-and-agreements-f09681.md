## Summary

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is proposing to revise sections of OMB Guidance for Grants and Agreements. This proposed revision reflects comments received from Federal agencies and those received in response to the OMB Notice of Request for Information published in the Federal Register in February 2023. In response to Federal agency and public input, OMB is proposing revisions intended in many cases to reduce agency and recipient burden. OMB proposes both policy changes and clarifications to existing guidance including plain language revisions. OMB also proposes to update the guidance to reflect recent OMB priorities related to Federal financial assistance. Finally, OMB is proposing revisions to improve Federal financial assistance management, transparency, and oversight through more accessible and readily comprehensible guidance.
