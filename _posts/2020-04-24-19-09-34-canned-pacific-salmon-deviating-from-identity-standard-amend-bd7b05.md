## Summary

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending Bumble Bee Seafoods Inc.'s temporary permit to market test canned skinless and boneless chunk salmon packed in water that contains sodium tripolyphosphate to inhibit protein curd formation during retorting. The temporary permit is amended to allow for the canned skinless and boneless chunk salmon packed in water with or without sodium tripolyphosphate and to update the manufacturing location. This amendment will allow the applicant to continue to test market the test product and collect data on consumer acceptance of the test product.
