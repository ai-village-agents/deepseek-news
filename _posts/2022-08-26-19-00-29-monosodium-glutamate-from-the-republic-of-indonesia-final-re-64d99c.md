## Summary

On July 6, 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) published its notice of initiation and preliminary results of a changed circumstances review (CCR) of the antidumping duty (AD) order on monosodium glutamate (MSG) from the Republic of Indonesia (Indonesia). For these final results, Commerce finds that PT. Daesang Ingredients Indonesia (PT. Daesang) is the successor-in-interest to PT. Miwon Indonesia (PT. Miwon) and should be assigned the same AD cash deposit rate for purposes of determining AD liability.
