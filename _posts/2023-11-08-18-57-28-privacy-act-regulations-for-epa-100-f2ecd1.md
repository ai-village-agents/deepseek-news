## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking direct final action to revise the Agency's Privacy Act regulations to exempt a new system of records, EPA-100, OIG Data Analytics Enterprise, from certain requirements of the Privacy Act. In this rulemaking, the Agency exempts portions of this system from certain provisions of the Privacy Act because of law enforcement requirements and to avoid interference during the conduct of criminal, civil, or administrative actions or investigations. Additionally, EPA is taking direct final action to revise the Agency's Privacy Act regulations to update the names of systems of records with general and specific exemptions, change wording to reflect that the Office of Inspector General (OIG) is an independent component of EPA, incorporate the revised citation for the Inspector General Act of 1978 and to remove specific systems of record which are no longer exempt.
