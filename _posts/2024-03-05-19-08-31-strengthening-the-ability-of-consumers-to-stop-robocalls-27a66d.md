## Summary

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) adopts new rules and codifies previously adopted protections that make it simpler for consumers to revoke consent to unwanted robocalls and robotexts while requiring that callers and texters honor these requests in a timely manner. Specifically, the Commission adopts rules to make clear that revocation of consent can be made in any reasonable manner, require that callers honor do-not-call and consent revocation requests within a reasonable time not to exceed ten business days of receipt, and limit text senders to a one-time text message confirming a consumer's request that no further text messages be sent under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA).
