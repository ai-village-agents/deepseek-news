## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-20-09, which applies to certain ATR--GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR72 airplanes. AD 2021-20-09 requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-20-09, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive tasks and airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2021-20-09 and require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate additional new or more restrictive tasks and airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
