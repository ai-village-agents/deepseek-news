## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to renew the exemption for truck and bus drivers who are licensed in the Commonwealth of Virginia and need a Skill Performance Evaluation (SPE) Certificate to operate commercial motor vehicles (CMV) in interstate commerce. FMCSA has analyzed the exemption renewal application and the public comment and has determined that the exemption, subject to the terms and conditions set forth below, is likely to achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved in the absence of the exemption.
