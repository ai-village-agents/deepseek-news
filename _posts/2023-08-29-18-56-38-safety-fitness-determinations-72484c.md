## Summary

FMCSA is interested in developing a new methodology to determine when a motor carrier is not fit to operate commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) in or affecting interstate commerce. FMCSA requests public comment on the need for a rulemaking to revise the regulations prescribing the safety fitness determination process; the available science or technical information to analyze regulatory alternatives for determining the safety fitness of motor carriers; feedback on the Agency's current safety fitness determination (SFD) regulations, including the process and impacts; the available data and costs for regulatory alternatives reasonably likely to be considered as part of this rulemaking; and responses to specific questions in this advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM).
