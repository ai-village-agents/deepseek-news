## Summary

This direct final rule (DFR) rescinds portions of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (Service) regulations containing general provisions related to requirements for programs and subprograms authorized under the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act and the Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act. This DFR removes redundancies and eliminates superfluous sections. These recissions will result in regulations that better serve the American public, streamline government operations, and increase efficiencies for recipients of our financial assistance programs.
