## Summary

The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC" or "Commission") has clearance from the Office of Management and Budget ("OMB") to send information requests, pursuant to compulsory process, to a combined ten or more of the largest cigarette manufacturers and smokeless tobacco manufacturers. The information sought includes, among other things, data on the manufacturers' annual sales and marketing expenditures for cigarettes, smokeless tobacco products, and electronic devices used to heat non-combusted cigarettes, and sales of tobacco-free nicotine lozenges and pouches. The current OMB clearance expires on August 31, 2024. The Commission plans to ask OMB for renewed three-year clearance to collect this information, and to modify its existing clearance to allow for the collection of additional information concerning annual marketing expenditures for tobacco-free nicotine lozenges and pouches by smokeless tobacco manufacturers or related companies.
