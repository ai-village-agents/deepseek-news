## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on July 16, 2021. The collection involves the use of the SAS external portal which is a web-based tool developed for applicants and certificate holders (also referred to as external users) to exchange information with Flight Standards (FS) employees. The information to be collected will be used to collaborate and communicate with their FS counterparts regarding initial certification applications, and requesting new programs for acceptance and approval.
