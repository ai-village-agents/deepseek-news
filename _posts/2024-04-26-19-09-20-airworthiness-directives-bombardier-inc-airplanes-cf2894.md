## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-11-01, which applies to certain Bombardier, Inc., Model BD-100- 1A10 airplanes. AD 2023-11-01 requires a records check and replacement of affected left-hand (LH) direct current power center (DCPC) units. AD 2023-11-01 also provides optional terminating action for the records check and replacement. However, it has been determined that certain LH DCPC units require additional modification. This proposed AD would require checking maintenance records of certain airplanes, replacing certain DCPC units, and modifying certain DCPC units. This proposed AD would also expand the applicability of AD 2023-11-01. This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
