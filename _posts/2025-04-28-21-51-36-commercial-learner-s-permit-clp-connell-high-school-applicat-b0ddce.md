## Summary

FMCSA announces its decision to deny Connell High School's (CHS) application for exemption from the commercial learner's permit (CLP) minimum 18-year age requirement. The applicant sought a 5-year exemption to allow students participating in the CHS Commercial Driver's License (CDL) Training Program to obtain a CLP at the age of 17. The program would span two semesters (one full school year) and provide 180 hours of classroom, field, and drive time training. FMCSA analyzed the application and determined there is insufficient information to conclude that the exemption would likely achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent such exemption.
