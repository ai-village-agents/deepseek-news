## Summary

On May 16, 2022, the President signed into law the Safe Sleep for Babies Act of 2021, requiring that crib bumpers, "regardless of the date of manufacture, shall be considered a banned hazardous product" under the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA). Pursuant to this authority, CPSC is proposing to codify the ban on crib bumpers pursuant to the Safe Sleep for Babies Act, and under a separate document, published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, terminate the rulemaking on crib bumpers/liners under the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA).
