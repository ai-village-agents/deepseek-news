## Summary

This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace at Benton Harbor, MI. The name and geographic coordinates of the Southwest Michigan Regional Airport, Benton Harbor, MI, would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of an airspace review conducted due to the decommissioning of the Keeler very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) Program. This action would bring the airspace into compliance with FAA orders and support instrument flight rule (IFR) procedures and operations.
