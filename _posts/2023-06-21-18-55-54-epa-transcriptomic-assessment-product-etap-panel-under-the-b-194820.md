## Summary

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has selected technical experts to serve as Special Government Employees (SGEs) on a review panel under the authority of the Board of Scientific Counselors (BOSC), a federal advisory committee to the Office of Research and Development (ORD). Selected experts will review ORD's draft documents detailing scientific studies supporting the development of transcriptomic-based reference values and their implementation as a new EPA Transcriptomic Assessment Product (ETAP). The ETAP is a proposed ORD assessment product that utilizes a standardized short-term in vivo study design and data analysis procedures to develop transcriptomic-based reference values for data poor chemicals.
