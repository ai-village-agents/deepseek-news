## Summary

This notice announces the availability of the Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS), which examines potential environmental impacts from the modernization and expansion of the International Falls Land Port of Entry (LPOE) in International Falls, Minnesota. The existing International Falls LPOE is owned and managed by GSA and is operated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The Final SEIS describes the purpose and need for the project; alternatives considered; the existing environment that could be affected; the potential impacts resulting from each of the alternatives; and proposed mitigation commitments. The Final SEIS also includes a Floodplain Assessment and Statement of Findings as a result of construction in a floodplain at the International Falls LPOE. Based on impacts analyses and public comments, GSA has identified Alternative 1 (Full Build) as described in the Final SEIS as its preferred alternative. Alternative 1 has also been identified as the environmentally preferred alternative.
