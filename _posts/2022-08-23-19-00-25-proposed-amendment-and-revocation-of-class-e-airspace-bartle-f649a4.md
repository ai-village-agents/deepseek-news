## Summary

This action proposes to amend and remove Class E airspace at Bartlesville and Miami, OK. The FAA is proposing this action due to airspace reviews conducted as part of the decommissioning of the Oswego very high frequency (VHF) omnidirectional range (VOR) as part of the VOR Minimal Operational Network (MON) Program. The name and geographic coordinates of the airports and navigation aids would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.
