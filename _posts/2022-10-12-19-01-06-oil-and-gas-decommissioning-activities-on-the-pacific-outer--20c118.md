## Summary

BSEE announces the availability of the Draft Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) for Oil and Gas Decommissioning Activities on the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). This Notice of Availability (NOA) is published pursuant to the regulations implementing the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) assisted BSEE in the preparation of this environmental impact statement. BSEE and BOEM prepared the Draft PEIS to inform BSEE's future decisions on operator applications to decommission OCS oil and gas platforms and associated infrastructure off the Southern California coast. The Army Corps of Engineers participated as a cooperating agency. This notice marks the start of the public review and comment period and announces two virtual public meetings. After the public meetings and written comments on the Draft PEIS have been reviewed and considered, a final PEIS will be prepared.
