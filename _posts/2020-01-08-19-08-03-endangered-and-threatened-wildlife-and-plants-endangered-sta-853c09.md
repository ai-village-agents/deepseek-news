## Summary

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to list the Sierra Nevada Distinct Population Segment (DPS) of the Sierra Nevada red fox (Vulpes vulpes necator) as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act (Act). This DPS of the Sierra Nevada red fox occurs along the highest elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would extend the Act's protections to this DPS. The effect of this rule will be to add this DPS to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife.
