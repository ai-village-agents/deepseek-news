## Summary

The FAA proposes to amend four VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways and establish a new RNAV T-route in the vicinity of Watertown, South Dakota. This action is necessary due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Watertown, SD, VOR/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC), which provides navigational guidance to portions of the affected VOR Federal airways. The Watertown VOR is being decommissioned as part of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (VOR MON) program.
