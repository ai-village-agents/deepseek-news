## Summary

The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE" or "the Department") is evaluating potential energy conservation standards for fans and blowers, including air circulating fans. Through this request for information ("RFI"), DOE seeks data and information to help determine whether potential energy conservation standards for fans and blowers, including air circulating fans, would result in standards that are technologically feasible and economically justified while producing significant conservation of energy. DOE welcomes written comments from the public on any subject within the scope of this document (including those topics not specifically raised in this RFI), as well as the submission of data and other relevant information.
