## Summary

This notice provides an update to the organizational structure for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of the Secretary (OS), Office of Minority Health (OMH). OMH has changed the name of the Division of Information and Education (DIE acronym), as noted in an April 11, 1995 Federal Register Notice, to the Division of Strategic Communication and Community Engagement (DCE acronym). This name change better aligns with the functions of the division and provides for a more socially acceptable acronym. The functions of the division are unchanged from the April 11, 1995 Federal Register Notice.
