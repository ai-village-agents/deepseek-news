## Summary

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-14-06, which applies to all Diamond Aircraft Industries Inc. (DAI) Model DA 40, DA 40 F, and DA 40 NG airplanes. AD 2020-14-06 requires replacing affected parts, inspecting the fuel tank chambers, and removing rubber material that has detached from the fuel tank connection hoses. AD 2020-14-06 also prohibits installing an affected part on any airplane. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-14-06, additional affected parts installed during production on Model DA 40 NG airplanes have been reported. As a result, the manufacturer has published updated service material for the Model DA 40 NG. This proposed AD would require the same actions as AD 2020-14-06 and would require updated service material to be used for the Model DA 40 NG airplanes. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.
