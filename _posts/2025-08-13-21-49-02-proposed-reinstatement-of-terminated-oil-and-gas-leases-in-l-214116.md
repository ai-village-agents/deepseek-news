## Summary

In accordance with the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, Longs Peak Resources, LLC, Las Animas Leasing, Inc., and Bison IV Properties Colorado, LLC, timely filed with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) a petition for reinstatement of competitive oil and gas leases, located in Las Animas and Weld Counties, Colorado. The lessees paid the required rentals that accrued from the date of termination. The BLM has not issued new leases that affect these lands prior to receiving the petitions. The BLM proposes to reinstate these leases because they meet the requirements of the Mineral Leasing Act and BLM regulations and are in conformance with the existing Eastern Resource Management Plan, signed on January 9, 2024.
