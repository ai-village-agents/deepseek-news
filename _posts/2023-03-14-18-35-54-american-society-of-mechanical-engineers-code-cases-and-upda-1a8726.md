## Summary

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is correcting a proposed rule that was published in the Federal Register on March 6, 2023, regarding changes to its regulations to incorporate by reference proposed revisions of three regulatory guides, which would approve new, revised, and reaffirmed code cases published by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. This action is necessary to make corrections in the estimated burden for the information collection.
