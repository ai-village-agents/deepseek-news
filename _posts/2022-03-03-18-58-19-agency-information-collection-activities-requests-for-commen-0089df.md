## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on October 26, 2021. The collection involves filling out the Application for a Pilot School Certification form and submitting this form to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The information to be collected is necessary because Title 14 Code of the Federal Regulations (CFR), part 141, requires an applicant for a pilot school to receive the FAA Administrator's approval for the issuance of a pilot school certificate. We have revised the name of this information collection for consistency with FAA form 8420-8, Application for Pilot School Certification. We have also updated the number of pilot schools.
