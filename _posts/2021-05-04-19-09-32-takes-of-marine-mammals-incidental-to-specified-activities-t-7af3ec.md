## Summary

NMFS received a request from the U.S. Navy (Navy) for an incidental harassment authorization (IHA) to incidentally take marine mammals, by Level B harassment only, during target and missile launch activities on San Nicolas Island (SNI). The Navy is requesting, and NMFS is proposing to issue, an IHA authorizing incidental take of marine mammals during continuation of target and missile launch activities identical to those already analyzed in a 2019 IHA issued on June 12, 2019 and a currently active Renewal IHA issued on June 19, 2020, which expires on June 11, 2021. The proposed mitigation, monitoring, and reporting measures remain the same as prescribed in the previous IHAs. This IHA would be effective from June 12, 2021 through June 11, 2022. Pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), NMFS is requesting comments on its proposal to issue an IHA to incidentally take marine mammals during the specified activities. NMFS will consider public comments prior to making any final decision on the issuance of the requested MMPA authorizations and agency responses will be summarized in the final notification of our decision. The Navy's activities are considered military readiness activities pursuant to the MMPA, as amended by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 (NDAA).
