## Summary

EPA is proposing to amend the significant new use rules (SNURs) for certain chemical substances identified herein, which were the subject of one or more premanufacture notices (PMNs), a Microbial Commercial Activity Notice (MCAN) for one substance, and in some cases significant new use notices (SNUNs). This action would amend the SNURs to (1) allow certain new uses reported in the SNUNs or PMNs without additional notification requirements, (2) modify the significant new use notification requirements based on the actions and determinations for the SNUN or PMN submissions or based on the examination of new test data or other information, and (3) make technical amendments to several SNURs. EPA is proposing these amendments based on our review of new and existing data for the chemical substances.
