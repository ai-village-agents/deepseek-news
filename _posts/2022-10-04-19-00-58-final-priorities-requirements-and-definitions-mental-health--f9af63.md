## Summary

The Department of Education (Department) announces final priorities, requirements, and definitions under the Mental Health Service Professional Demonstration Grant Program (MHSP), Assistance Listing Number 84.184X. We may use one or more of these priorities, requirements, and definitions for competitions in fiscal year (FY) 2022 and later years. These final priorities, requirements, and definitions are designed to allow the Department to provide competitive grants to support and demonstrate innovative partnerships between one or more high need local educational agencies (LEAs) (as defined in this notice,) or a State educational agency (SEA) on behalf of one or more high-need LEAs, and an eligible Institution of Higher Education (eligible IHEs) (as defined in this notice) to train school-based mental health services providers (services providers) for employment in schools and local educational agencies (LEAs). The goal of the program is to increase the number and diversity of high-quality, trained providers available to address the shortages of mental health services professionals in schools served by high-need LEAs.
