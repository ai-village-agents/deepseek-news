## Summary

The Federal Trade Commission ("Commission" or "FTC") is amending the Hart-Scott-Rodino ("HSR") Premerger Notification Rules ("Rules") that require the parties to certain mergers and acquisitions to file reports with the FTC and the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice ("the Assistant Attorney General") (together the "Antitrust Agencies" or "Agencies") and to wait a specified period of time before consummating such transactions. In a separate document published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, the Commission is announcing the annual adjustment of the filing fee thresholds and amounts required by the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022 ("2022 Amendments"), contained within the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023. In this document, the Commission amends Parts 801 and 803 of the Rules to make the ministerial changes required to reflect the annual adjustment of the filing fee thresholds and amounts required by the 2022 Amendments.
