## Summary

These special conditions are issued for The Boeing Company (Boeing) Model 747-8 series airplane. This airplane, as modified by Boeing, will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport category airplanes. This design feature is associated with the installation of advanced technology induction coil cooktops in the main deck galleys on a Boeing Model 747-8 series airplane. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.
