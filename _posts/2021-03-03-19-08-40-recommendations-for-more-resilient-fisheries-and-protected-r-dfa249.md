## Summary

On January 27, 2021, the White House issued an Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad. As part of this effort, NOAA is collecting recommendations on how to make fisheries and protected resources more resilient to climate change, including changes in management and conservation measures, and improvements in science, monitoring, and cooperative research. NOAA requests written input from interested parties on how best to achieve these objectives described in the Executive Order.
