## Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the Alaska State Implementation Plan submitted on May 16, 2022, and August 11, 2022. The revisions proposed for approval update Alaska's adoption by reference date for Federal regulations relied upon for implementation of the air program, including permitting requirements and air pollution test methods. The revisions also add procedures for electronic submission of documents for air permits and other authorizations, update air permitting and emission fees, add additional clarifying language to the fee provisions, and specify emissions inventory reporting requirements. The EPA is proposing to approve the submitted revisions as consistent with Clean Air Act requirements.
