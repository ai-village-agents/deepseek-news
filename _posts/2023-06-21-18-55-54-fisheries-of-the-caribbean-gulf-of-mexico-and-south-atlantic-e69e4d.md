## Summary

NMFS implements an accountability measure for commercial greater amberjack in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) reef fish fishery for the 2023 fishing year through this temporary rule. NMFS has determined that Gulf greater amberjack landings have exceeded the commercial annual catch target (ACT). Therefore, the commercial fishing season for greater amberjack in the Gulf exclusive economic zone (EEZ) will close on June 18, 2023, and the sector will remain closed until the start of the next commercial fishing season on January 1, 2024. This closure is necessary to protect the Gulf greater amberjack resource.
