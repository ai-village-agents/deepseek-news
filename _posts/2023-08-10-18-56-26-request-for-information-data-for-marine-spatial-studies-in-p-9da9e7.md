## Summary

NOAA's National Ocean Service (NOS), National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) in partnership with the NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) and Southeast Regional Office (SERO), hereafter NOAA, are working to build spatial science capacity in the U.S. Caribbean Region. Through this Request for Information, we are seeking public input to identify coastal and marine spatial data or other critical information to inform marine spatial analyses. Additionally, we are seeking feedback on data shortcomings and gaps that should be addressed prior to commencing marine spatial studies. The input we receive from meetings, as well as the responses to the items listed in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section of this document, will be used to inform potential coastal and ocean development activities in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI), such as development of renewable energy facilities, aquaculture, and other blue economy sectors.
