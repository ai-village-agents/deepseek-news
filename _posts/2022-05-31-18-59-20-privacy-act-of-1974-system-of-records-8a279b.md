## Summary

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the DoD is modifying and reissuing a current system of records titled, "Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting Systems (DEERS)," DMDC 02 DoD. This system of records was originally established by the Defense Manpower Data Center to collect and maintain records that are used to manage the issuance of DoD identification cards, manage physical and logical access to DoD facilities and to provide a database for determining DoD entitlements and privileges. Additionally, DEERS is used to support DoD healthcare management programs, assess manpower and support personnel and readiness functions. This system of records notice (SORN) is being updated to support additional information sharing of records outside of the DoD in order to streamline the DoD identification card issuance process. In addition, it clarifies the routine use governing the data sharing DoD utilizes in support of the Public Service Forgiveness loan program and it expands the routine use governing the data sharing in support of the Unemployment Compensation for Ex-service members to state workforce agencies, or to the Department of Labor contractors or grantees. This modification revises the routine uses. The new routine use will allow DoD to disclose information to the Government Publishing Office (GPO).
