## Summary

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for an information collection. The collection involves the filing of a complaint with the FAA alleging a violation of any requirement, rule, regulation, or order issued under certain statutes within the jurisdiction of the FAA. The FAA will use the information collected to determine if the alleged violation warrants investigation or action.
