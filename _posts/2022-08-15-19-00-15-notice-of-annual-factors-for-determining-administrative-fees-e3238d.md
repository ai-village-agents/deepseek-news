## Summary

As required by Section 8(q) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, this Federal Register notice announces the per unit, monthly fee rates used to determine the on-going administrative fees for public housing agencies (PHAs) administering the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV), Mainstream, and Moderate Rehabilitation programs, including the Moderate Rehabilitation Single Room Occupancy program, for calendar year (CY) 2021. PHAs use administrative fees to cover costs associated with administering the HCV Program. Publishing the CY 2021 fees allow PHAs to budget appropriately and is important for PHA record keeping purposes. Additionally, publishing this notice retroactively allows PHAs to continue portability billing for families that ported in CY 2021. This notice follows HUD's previous publication of the rates on HUD's website and makes no changes to those rates.
